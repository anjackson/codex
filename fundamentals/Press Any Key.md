What happens when you edit a document?
--------------------------------------

In [this paper][1], Allen and Wickett starts with an abstract model of an XML String and then based on this Platonic perspective then go on to assert that all Strings are immutable, and that the Document Cannot Be Edited.

Which is fine, for those of you using a document authoring system composed of mathematical constructs. Unfortunately, on my current budget, I am restricted to using electronic computers that aim to implement an approximation to those mathematical ideals. My computer does not belong only to Turing, but also von Neumann, and many thousands of other engineers and technicians involved in the evolution of the laptop in front of me.

As you can probably tell from my tone, this kind of paper bothers me. Such broad statements feel, to me, like the worst kind of artificial controversy, declaring numerous entirely functional concepts as problematic because they don't fit the authors' assumptions. 

This falls into a class of arguments that all jar with me because they appear to deny the materiality of digital media. Various arguments appear, floating on an air of abstracted understanding. How can we tell them apart, if they don't agree on their terms, and how can they agree on terms without relating to the world we experience, and how can the terms be related to the real world other than by seeking our more concrete definitions of the process and functioning of real computer systems?

All of the notes in this collection are, to some extend, an attempt to address this apparent lack of coherence with a solid grounding in realistic systems. To that end, I though it would be interesting to pick apart what really happens when you edit a document.

The Short Version
-----------------

Well, the _very_ short version is, 'it depends'.  Precisely what happens when a document is edited depends on a lot of details concerning the software and hardware state of the machine. However, under some reasonable assumptions, we can
