Defining format, but avoiding baggage.

On Format
---------

- Herd Immunity
    - Format obsolescence as disease 
    - We are the immune system 
- The First Preservation Strategy: Format...
- Data And Metadata, interpretation difference.
- eBook wars, like early years of DRM music etc.
- files versus filesystems. Latter obsolete first, former at risk due to persistent ram plus walled gardens.
-  Is ISO Enough? Open standards etc.

A format is a social convention for exchanging data.
A format is a way of grouping documents that share some features.

Perhaps the difference here is whether we are trying to document all possible 'strains' of a format, or whether we are just trying to find what format(s) the item is consistent with, e.g. in order to pass the item on for deeper inspection. Or in other words, are we defining format by implementation (software) and context or by specification?

Format specs must be implemented to come alive, and it is the processes that implement the specs that are definitive.
