It's not the digital that's the problem
Directly.
It just makes new machines easy.

OR

Software is the only thing that distinguishes 'digital preservation' from any other discrete, symbolic communcation system (from Morse Code to the written word).


Something about computing and green and brown field development. 
Moving into cities built on cities.

Broadcast to narrowcast - no longer a property of the medium.

Then point out that that the other part of the theoretical underpinnings is that the comms is done using computers, so that Turing applies, etc. Refer to Validation page.

So, the critical thing is the Turing machine, and practically, this means software is at the heart of it.

The important of the von Neumann architecture. The separate of data and code underpinning the entire concept of data that can be separated and made portable etc.

Also, this is archetypical of the engineering decisions that underly the technologies we are attempting to preserve. That understanding the technology is one part, but understanding use, adoption, is critical to understanding preservation.

But separable code and data is only the beginning. The buildings of our software machines have already discovered that raw machine code and binary data and not necessarily the best way of maintaining access, even to their own systems. To understand that, we need to dip into another part of information theory - formal languages.

Describe the interpretation v. representation problem again. It is possible to do absolutely anything with a computer using only machine code, but it has not proved a easily interpretable construct. Cray and his toggle switches. The engineers sought a middle ground, a language precise enough to be turned into machine code, but approachable enough that the meaning of the program might be understood. i.e. there is a communication story here, with the source code communicating a slightly different set of things, with some room for error. 

Define the formal languages, describe the Chomsky heirarchy briefly, to refer back to in a subsequent section.

Also, what about persisting the state of the programs, which is where we get interesting.

Also sufficiently isolated from technical details, vector of cross-platform comms. It is in this context that the first digital 'formats' start to appear [citation needed what about physical digital formats?]
