It's not the digital that's the problem
Directly.
It just makes new machines easy.

OR

Software is the only thing that distinguishes 'digital preservation' from any other discrete, symbolic communcation system (from Morse Code to the written word).


Something about computing and green and brown field development. 
Moving into cities built on cities.

Broadcast to narrowcast - no longer a property of the medium.

Then point out that that the other part of the theoretical underpinnings is that the comms is done using computers, so that Turing applies, etc. Refer to Validation page.
