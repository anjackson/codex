Planning
- top down worse than stakeholder engagement. 
- CI versus an initio. 
- Separate choices - strategy versus implementation. See also performance and implementation.
- Baysian versus frequentist... First principles/ab initio or Empirical modelling.

Risks and Threats

* Format analysis - cf versions don't matter, features do.
* Hard disk quality risks - Losing half the array - CDROM of health data
* c.f. Advice for public sector TNA?

### Obsolescence

Given that is has proven possible to access the data, some might argue that the floppy disks and the data on them are not obsolete. I would say that this long, brittle chains of migration and extensive guesswork are exactly what obsolescence looks like. 

Even though a more efficient way to access the disks themselves is now available, the problem shifts understanding how to use the disks and the software, and how to access the data within.

It is the slow death of a thousand ambiguities, rather than an sudden, jarring expiration. Obsolescence is approached, rather than attained, with the costs of access rising every step of the way.
