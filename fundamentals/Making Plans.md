* top down worse than stakeholder engagement. 
* CI versus an initio. 
* Separate choices - strategy versus implementation. See also performance and implementation.
* Baysian versus frequentist... First principles/ab initio or Empirical modelling.

Critically, two separate/complicit choices, the 'strategy', i.e. the format mapping and the values embodied by it, and the 'implementation', i.e. the benchmarking/timings/etc. There is some give and take, I know.

> But don't think too much. There are classes of problems -- ones in which there are more variables than the conscious mind can juggle -- where thinking overwhelms your brain's ability to synthesize all these variables into a good conclusion. Timothy Wilson, a U Virginia psychologist, asked two groups of female college students to choose and keep their favorite art print from a selection containing a Monet, a van Gogh, and some inspirational kitten posters. A control group was asked to rate each poster from 1 to 9 and keep their top one. The experimental group was asked to fill in questionnaires about what they liked about each poster.
> 
> The controls overwhelmingly picked the fine art. Follow-up questions established that they were still happy with their decisions weeks later.
> 
> But the experimental group -- the group that had to explain what they liked about each poster -- chose the kittens. And when they were followed up, they were disappointed with their decision.
> 
> Wilson explains that the failure arises because the good things about fine art are difficult to describe: they are intangible aesthetic elements. We like them, but most of us can't explain why. On the other hand, the virtues of a kitten-picture are easy to enumerate. When asked to explain, rationally, which one is best, kittens win every time. But it is this very superficiality that causes us to quickly tire of the kittens and wish for a Monet.

Refer back to the Perfect Experiment.

We focus on preservation as a process of continuous improvement, plus some more general considerations for content at the archaeological end of the access frequency spectrum.
