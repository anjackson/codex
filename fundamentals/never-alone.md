Synopsis: On how the identified 'digital preservation community' is not alone, and indeed that concerns about longevity of information are held very widely, and have shaped what we have now.

About how formats are significant properties.

About how other groups fight the same battle under different banners (against lock-in etc.), or as enthusiasts.

About the remaining problems, and the role memory organizations can play by given permanence to the efforts of others.
