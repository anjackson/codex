Digital preservation is not a science, in at least two important ways.

## There is no veil ##

Newton quote, no mystery here.

No experimental evidence is required to see that GeoJSON is a bad format to store CAT scans in. No new theories are required to determine that converting Microsoft Word to PDF may discard a lot of information [SigPropBehold]. These are all constructed systems, built by humans, with documentation to be inspected, whether that is prose or code. To evaluate the format landscape and determine likely preservation options is fundamentally an act of _literature_.


### Emergence ###

Of course, once the likely options have been determined, based on knowledge and experience, it may well be worth experimenting with different tools and approaches. This can be used to test whether the credible strategies behave as expected, and of course to compare different implementations of the same strategy to see which performs best in a given context.

At this point, when we are attempting to understand the emergent behaviour of complex software systems, then the scientific method can help isolate our investigates from our biases and assumptions. 

Criticality of sharing of experimental results in order for this to work (as that's why it works for science).


## Value judgements ##

Looking back at the early talk of 'significant properties', we see 'essence' etc.

But Sig in eye of beholder, that identity paper, have shown us this is a lie. The decision to normalise Word documents to PDF is not just a statement about the relative confidence of access to those formats. It is also a judgement about what is important.

This is not a problem. Our decisions, what we choose to preserve, and why, have always involved value judgements. We only want to preserve things that are important to people now or in the future. That's the whole point.

But, we should be aware that this is a value judgement. We should be wary of taking the technically easier option, without evaluating the damage it may do to the value of the items. Most importantly, the process of judgement itself cannot be made without reference to the needs and values of the community we are preserving these things for.


## Conclusions ##

Scientific, but not a science. Evidence-based policy making. Stakeholder engagement. Closer to politics than physics.
