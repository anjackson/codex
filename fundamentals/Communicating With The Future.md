The field of digital preservation has been described as communication with the future. Rather, it is the process of attempting to ensure that future communication can occur. However, treatement so far has neglected to use the well-established mathematical theory of communication/information science. These fields of research form the basis of digital computing and communications, and provide a theoretical foundation upon which any theory of digital preservation must abut.

Already a theory of communication, which underlies many of the technologies our current digital preservation mechanisms depend on.

Set the scene, describe source coding theorem, and describe our 'channels'. Refer to Zeroth Law page.
