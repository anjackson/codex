title: Communicating with the Future

The field of digital preservation has been described as communication with the future. Rather, it is the process of attempting to ensure that future communication can occur. However, treatement so far has neglected to use the well-established mathematical theory of communication/information science. These fields of research form the basis of digital computing and communications, and provide a theoretical foundation upon which any theory of digital preservation must abut.

Already a theory of communication, which underlies many of the technologies our current digital preservation mechanisms depend on.

Shannon Entropy, Compression and Representation Information
-----------------------------------------------------------
We see compression makes files smaller but increases their entropy.

But while low entropy is clearly low content, high entropy case is less clear.

High entropy tends towards random noise.

Thus, without flags, very compressed files become impossible to distinguish. The RI has been effectively moved outside of the object, 

Information volume fixed.

Errors and redundancy.

There is presumably a parallel to the previous case about adding redundant information and the amount you need on a given noisy channel.

Picture of an orange v. the phrase 'an orange'.

Interesting use evaluating complexity of Pictish symbols: http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2010/03/26/rspa.2010.0041.full

Should lead into Turing

### Entropy and Transformations ###
Look at uni-gram and di-gram entropy, as the latter should be more revealing due to the fact that order matters.

Is this a separate point, or is analysing transformations via entropy critical?


Validation and the Halting Problem
----------------------------------
The software and the digital objects form the program.

In general, there are no shortcuts, you need to run fully to know for sure what the outcome will be.

Can get away with it by limiting document capabilities? And the Software?

Turing complete formal languages cannot be fully validated (only syntax)

Migration of languages cannot be validated.
