In the field of [thermodynamics][1], there was a law so obvious, so taken for granted, that no-one even realised it could be considered a law. The notion of thermal equilibrium - roughly speaking, the notion that a 'temperature' could be defined at all - was so fundamental that it simply assumed without question. Later, if became clear that the first, second and third laws of thermodynamics were not strictly consistent unless this axiom was added. The primacy of this assumption was recognised formally by calling it the [zeroth law of thermodynamics][2].

I believe that the field of digital preservation has followed a similar path, and that the mathematical theory of communication that began with [Claude Shannon's][3] [seminal work from the 1948][4] is so fundamental to every single digital preservation system and concept we have been using. In short, that Shannon's [noisy-channel coding theorem][5] should be considered our Zeroth Law.


Set the scene, describe source coding theorem, and describe our 'channels'. 

...

Source coding theorem as backbone of what we already used, lead into what it tells us about preserving information if we consider a format migration 'channel'.

But this applies to everything - even the 'discrete' form applies as much to text and morse code as it does to WAV files and HTTP. So, [what's so special about digital preservation?](What is Special About Digital Preservation.html).
