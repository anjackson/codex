In the field of Thermodynamics, there was a law so obvious, so taken for granted, that no-one even realised it was a law at first. Only after discovering and first, second and third laws of Thermodynamics did X realise that each of those depended on another law, quite simply, that heat moves from X to Y. This was considered so fundamental that it was named the Zeroth Law.

I believe that the field of digital preservation has followed a similar path, and that the mathematical theory of communication outlined in X is so fundamental to every single digital preservation system and concept we have been using, that Shannon's noisy-channel coding theorem should be considered our Zeroth Law.


Set the scene, describe source coding theorem, and describe our 'channels'. 

...

Source coding theorem as backbone of what we already used, lead into what it tells us about preserving information if we consider a format migration 'channel'.

But this applies to everything - even the 'discrete' form applies as much to text and morse code as it does to WAV files and HTTP. So, [what's so special about digital preservation?](What is Special About Digital Preservation.html).
