title: Digital Preservatioz`n Lessons Learned
---

Potential memory institution role as habitat, as ecosystem support that helps open RI flourish and helps it to be sustained.

We can't preserve it unless the licence permit us to do so.

We cannot do this alone, but we do not have to. 

Work together, some working with vendors to open up old stuff.

Discovery, ensuring existing tools are known and exploited as appropriate. Minimise reinvention of the wheel.

Open source fundamentally changed digital preservation.

Impossible problems (due to secrets and licences, the latter being the worst as it may mean that even if reverse engineering is done, we can't use it, and it's hard to know you've done it right) are replaced with merely difficult problems (can you get this piece of sw to build, or run, it know someone who can?). 

HTML, jpeg, gif, Png, jp2, ...

PDF, DOC/X, etc. very capable open source implementations, but some gaps.

Pages etc.

ODF, eBooks battlegrounds of closed and open standards.




- The AIP Is Finished (OAIS interpretation issue)
- Significant Property Schemes Will Save Us (Sig Prop interp issue)
- The Bytes Are The Digital Object (process versus state)
- The Format Specification Is Enough (Formal languages thing)
- Formats Are Defined By Specification (The code always comes first)

- You can fix it with a document (people change each other, the document produced is an artefact not a cause)
- Obsolescence is the main problem
    - Various...
- It's the digital bit of Digital Preservation that makes it difficult (technology, book to audio to flip books to digital to etc growing media complexity and technology dependence.
- Obsolescence means emulation or migration. (porting as a third way)
- Emulation and migration (i think you mean transformation or translocation)
    - PA: Encourage data sharing.
    - PA: Encourage use of sustainable formats.
- Multiple PA mean loss is inevitable, just like analogue. (Countable!)
    - Find that link to that blog.
- Planning mixing choice and implementation in one?
- The solution to every DP problem is a new project from scratch. This time we'll get it right! (from-scratch solutions)
- The basic problem is solved.
- RI needs and processes they support ...
