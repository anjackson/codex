To outline the two halves of the communication, the performance and the understanding, or reference another page covering this.

That the difficulties in preserving access to digital media arise primarily because the access the item is mediated, not because they are digital. The same can be said of needing a speaker of an obscure language to understand a book. You can either keep the language alive (emulation), or translate the book (migration).

That RI is of two kinds:

1. Performance RI, that is the information required to reconstruct a particular interpretation of a digital artefact, i.e. to regenerate a signal to be interpreted by an actor outside the system. e.g. rendering a PDF.
2. Perception/Understanding/ RI, that is any futher information required to support the actor in understanding the preserved signal.

That actor-RI is subjective. It's consqeuences aare tjhat is should be layered rather that designed up-front, and turns into educational resources if you wait long enough

IMPORTANT: Identifiers and distinguishing 'this version created the item' from 'this is the intended interpretation'. e.g. DOC is tricky here, as writer version confused with reader version?

Then the choice is the spectrum of attempting to preserve the performance precisely, and therefore avoiding the interpretation side. OR attempting to preserve 'the information', and judging that we can judge whether a new performance achieves this.
