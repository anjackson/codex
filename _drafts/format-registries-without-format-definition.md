Not necessarily. Zoological classification proceeded apace without consensus on terms like Species, long before we understood DNA and the Periodic Table started to take shape before we could tell all the atoms from all the molecules. BUT the price you pay is that you must accept that your taxonomy may have to change as our understanding grows. Species are renamed, nobel gases discovered

not necessarily, but I don't  think you can expect the entries and IDs to be permanent when the semantics are subjective.
