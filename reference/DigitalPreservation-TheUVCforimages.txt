The KB’s e-Depot guarantees secure long-term storage of digital material. However, long-term accessibility is another matter. Research has shown that the storage format in particular – the structure in which the data of a digital object is stored on the carrier – is a point of concern. Formats are complex and not based on open standards or specifications. As the KB aims to preserve the original object, only a limited number of strategies can be applied.

Together with IBM Netherlands, the KB has developed a new preservation strategy, based on the Universal Virtual Computer (UVC). With the UVC it is possible to read files without adapting them and without the original hardware or software. JPEG images can now be viewed independent of changes in technology. Afterwards, the method was extended for GIF images as well. The UVC project took place between September 2003 and April 2004.
