Defining open formats
=====================
Defining what we mean by a good open format is difficult.

* Implementable: OOXML is not open, ODF is open. OOXML specs refer to other closed specs.
* Independent: ODF is controlled by ISO, OOXML is controlled by msft, and msft *now* claims that msft will never give ISO control. Rather msft wants to give control to the ECMA - a group controlled by msft. This directly contradicts what msft first promised.
 * Longevity of the standards body?
* Adoption: ODF is used by several different organizations. Anybody is welcome to freely use ODF. OOXML is used by msft, and novell - due to a very sneaky and secretive document.
* Open Development Process.
* Open Reference Implementation.
* No Forks.  Promises from implementers to follow the standard body process and maintain interoperability. c.f. [a captive standard](http://www.digistan.org/open-standard).
* No patents: Does OOXML legalese mean that they can warp the standard and then sue?
* Extra Marks: Open Source Reference Implementation.
* Extra Marks: Steps to ensure that the RI is not brittle and that bugs are caught and rarely damage user data.

Evaluating Open Digital Formats
===============================
An article on these issues.

Include suggestion of an Open Format Certification, which is not unlike the [Open Source Initiative](http://opensource.org/). They have a 'Open Standards Requirement' but this is not quite the same thing.

The problem is that it comes down to intent and trust.  MS has broken our trust before, and so they are difficult to trust now.
