[djatoka][1]  is a Java-based open source image server with an attractive
basic feature set and extensibility under control of the community of
implementers. Off-the-shelf, djatoka provides compression and region
extraction of JPEG 2000 images, URI-addressability of regions, and
support for a rich set of input/output image formats (e.g., BMP, GIF,
JPG, PNG, PNM, TIF, JPEG 2000). djatoka also comes with a plug-in
framework that allows transformations to be applied to regions and
resolutions (e.g., watermarking).

[IIPImage][2]  is an [Open Source][3]  light-weight streaming client-server system for the web-based viewing and zooming of ultra high-resolution images.
