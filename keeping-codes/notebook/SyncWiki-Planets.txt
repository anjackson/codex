project wiki, so that they can be shared with others. See [
my user page][6]  for a starting point.

# For The Testbed #



 - Make ExpEmul clearer about what has been done, and is yet to
do.
 - Merge my TB to do items into the big list.
 - Testbed confusion, are we 'dry-run' or 'public', roughly
 - ACTION: 19th Oct - copy old structure to folder, and then
templatise the wizzard.
 - ACTION: 20th Oct - Results page.
 - ACTION: DR Bugs - items as folders, plus: Caused by:
java.lang.NullPointerException at
eu.planets_project.tb.gui.backing.data.DigitalObjectTreeNode.getDownloadUri(DigitalObjectTreeNode.java:111)
at sun.reflect.GeneratedMethodAccessor1929.invoke(Unknown
Source)
 - ACT: Silly save-as mis-feature/bug... AND Persist it straight
away. java.lang.NullPointerException
.tb.gui.backing.exp.NewExpWizardController.commandSaveExperimentAs(NewExpWizardController.java:812)...


# For the Service Developer's Meeting #



 - WEE: Add PREMIS Event metadata, and other standard
metadata?
 - PSERV: Characterise and Compare interfaces? Follow-up Fabian's
email.
 - ACTION: Add to agenda of SDM, passing back basic performance
statistics, passing back a failure code, expose URL,
 - ACTION: Proposal with AL about how to embed optional
performance data into the ServiceReport.
 - Allow generic HTML report to be returned in the ServiceReport?
Type = 'text/html' etc.
 - ACTION: Propose full switch to SF over Christmas? Lose the
history? What structure to use?
 - ACTION: Switch from LGPL to Apache 2 in the code-base.


# For the Interoperability Framework #



 - Sustainability, wiki page? NOW?
 - What is the IF final release date?
 - Who is keeping Wolfgang (and others) up to date?
 - Minimal UDFR proposal based on TechReg?
 - Extended format URIs, via query and/or fragment? [http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/net/URI.html][7] 
 - Format registry should store sig file in jar and download to
tmp.
 - IF Admin: Institution entity needed by PLATO and TB.
 - IF Admin: Ability to add roles would be useful.
 - Services: Metadata - Flag for 'private', meaning only Planets
Partners can access? i.e. use a new Group?
 - Services: Metadata - Flag for implementation type?
'inline-java', 'cli', 'jni', 'native-service', 'emulation'...
 - Services: Add a planets-partner security role - This lays the
ground-work for 'private' services and features, if necessary.
 - Services: ServiceDescription.compare is rather slow as it
transforms to XML.
 - Services: Compare service interface - Compare(DO,DO) - What
does it do/return? - Support image diffs?
 - Data Registry: Talk to IF about DR plan for final release -
solve user auth issue? Search interface? Layout?
 - Data Registry: Digital Object Caching - Write to/from ZIP:
[
http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/compression/][8] 
 - Data Registry: Data Registry should have user spaces, not just
be one big scratch space.
 - Data Registry: Need a shared UI?
 - PServ Build: Amend pserv ant build to provide option to build
only signed off services - AJ
 - PServ Build: Add targets to list the pure-java and non-pure
java projects, indicating which should be deployable. i.e. 'status'
needed.
 - PServ Build: Sub-project build 'clean' also cleans the
build?Migrate dom = ServiceCreator.createTestService(Migrate.QNAME,
Mdb2SiardMigrate.class, sWSDL_LOC); BindingProvider bp =
(BindingProvider) dom; SOAPBinding binding = (SOAPBinding)
bp.getBinding(); System.out.println("Is MTOM on?
"+binding.isMTOMEnabled()); // binding.setMTOMEnabled(true);

Documentation
Note that there seem to be problems running tests under Java 6
(see pserv/build.common.xml). : Note that there seem to be problems
running behind a SQUID proxy, where the 'Transfer-Encoding:
chunked' mode is not working. It is not clear where the blame lies.
I think SQUID pre-3.1 does not support chunked transfer, which is a
HTTP/1.1 feature. The server and client are supposed to realise
this is happening and fall-back to HTTP/1.0, but this is not
happening it seems. Is SQUID refusing badly? Or is the JBoss JAX-WS
stack at fault?

# Significant Properties - Cologne - Feb 2009 #



 - Control of Enviroment
 - Missing vocab
 - No isolated hardware
 - Need metrics that cover loss/change, but do not rely on
context.
 - XCL
 - Attempting to be an information superclass, but no access
mech.
 - Implicit properties are missed. i.e. The Render Stack ==
Assumption set.

   - Default alpha channel? Default colourspace. Encoding.


 - Appears to assume there is a hard line between Technical and
Conceptual info.
 - Needs
 - XCL, but where be Implicit Properties :)
 - Service Properties
 - Environment Properties
 - Render Stack/Experience
 - Digital Object Format Properties
 - Digital Object Instance Properties
 - "Moments"
 - Filesystem Properties? Basic properties like bytesize?
 - Finite list of sensible contexts?
 - 'Preservation Maximus', 'Access' ?

From [
http://www.jboss.org/file-access/default/members/jbossrichfaces/freezone/docs/devguide/en/faq/faq.html][22] 

1.78. How to handle ViewExpiredException? As RichFaces 3.1 is
targeted at JSF 1.1, you won't get ViewExpiredExceptions generated
when using it with JSF 1.2. This exception appears after session
timeout. Fortunately there is an easy workaround. Add to your
web.xml:

&lt;context-param&gt;
&lt;param-name&gt;com.sun.faces.enableRestoreView11Compatibility&lt;/param-name&gt;
&lt;param-value&gt;true&lt;/param-value&gt;
&lt;/context-param&gt;

# Testbed #



 - Corpora and the Medical science analogy.
 - The [
Testbed To Do list is held here][23] .
 - Feedback on the Corpora Report. IF/7 Repository Integration is
relevant here. Clarified and reflected my Qs? TB can help with
corpora building.
 - Look in DELOS report. Some competition. Look up original
paper.
 - CI: Make URL neater, or at least poke the user on to /testbed/
from the base /.
 - Experiment Types?
 - Preservation Plan Execution, e.g. on Test Corpora?
 - Check Preservation Plan is well-formed?
 - Compare Plan generation services?
 - Test Preservation Planning Service? e.g. Do they all agree that
PDF 1.0 is out of date? 'Compare Format Risk Services?'
 - Migrate: Via Format X? Two-stage Workflow?
 - Database experiment? Provide a session and probe it? More than
just a char-mig-char?
 - 'Emulation Experiment':
 - Workflows should measure all? Does this make sense for property
measurement?
 - Measure speed? Add more?
 - Speed-only experiments? i.e. no manual properties? no other
info needed either?
 - Experiment Completeness Measure? Peer review even?
 - TB: To visualise the results etc. What about comparing similar
experiments? Another level of vis?


Can we do meaningful experiments on ill-defined types? Like
documents?


 - Methodological Framework?
 - Results Database?
 - Discovery Framework?
 - Testing Framework?
 - Incentives?
 - Resource Requirement Estimate?
 - Document, loss of info?
 - Timings always recorded.
 - 'Run this experiment on my data.'
 - Input to Tool Registry.
 - CERT: Implements a service interface? Runs basic tests.
Well-Formed Service. Actually a test.


REZA: Third party tool certification. * Certifying a Tool, goes
to PRONOM. * Certifying a Service, status goes to Serv Reg.
Automatically done? Distinguish! * Who are the Test Administrators?
Where does the effort come from? * Should this not be pulled from
the TB DB? Not a seperate workflow? * 'Planets Compatible Web
Service' etc. LFP Likely Fitness for Purpose.

# Interoperability Framework #



 - [
IF 3 Requirements][24] 
 - [
IF 3 Bugs][25] 
 - Fix log4j issues. Passing false? Jars? Web-logger interface can
diagnose.
 - Build on [DOAP][26] ?
See [this
article][27]  and see this [
exploration of the schema][28] .
 - DR: IDEA: Time-boxed files. 'You can delete this after
22-12-08.'


## Testing ##



 - Installation health-checks would be fantastic.
 - A button to test the email set-up would be great.
 - Use [http://easymock.org/][29]  to
make better tests.
 - TEST: Are we running Java 6? Well it won't work then!
 - TEST: Are all the required components deployed? Are the
optional components present?
 - TEST: Test by invoking the web-service tester, currently under
/sample/, on a service that should exist?
 - **In-Browser Integration Testing**
 - [http://selenium.openqa.org/
Selenium][30]  could be used to do proper user testing
automation.


# TCC &amp; Integration Issues #



 - MAJOR: [Adam] CDM+GForge. Coherence of other XML schema.
Document a process for managing XML Schema across project.
 - MAJOR: Service Interfaces
 - Process to define new services? Needed?
 - See IF stuff on Service Architecture and Basic Services.
 - Agree here?


## Distribution ##



 - MAJOR: Central starting-point on the website for the software,
when public.
 - MAJOR: Licencing, at least for the if_sp project:
 - BSD for code, CC for documentation?
 - Consider [EUPL][31] 
 - Documentation:
 - From dev to arch, the product needs fully docs.
 - Product docs, licencing, white papers, permanence etc.
 - DOC: No spaces in names in WebAnnotations!
 - DOC: Go get version 2.0 of the IF from GForge.
 - DOC: Public docs in SVN for Arch and Guidelines, need
Licence.
 - DOC: Workflow dev guidelines, different from Service.
 - Consistency:
 - Check in front page and theme pages. Use them too.
 - Consistent user types and access rights accross the product.
ANON access?


## Interoperable Planets Properties ##


How do we use the ontologies we have created? What concrete
forms will they take?

The problem is that the current JAXB approach requires a
recompile when new properties are added. This was the reason for
the L1 split in services. Properties have the same issue, and need
to be defined in an extensible form that can be brought into line
with the various Planets concept models.


 - Define an extensible name-space to cover formats and XC*L now,
and agreed charactersitics etc in the future.
 - pn.do.format = URI
 - pn.do.type = image
 - XCEL needs some namespacing for the extractor/comparitor.
 - Without it, we can only compare XCL v XCL, not the same
properties recovered in different ways.
 - Long-term issues
 - No business can really do this.
 - Helper codes
 - Need helper to match DROID PUIDs to extensions, mime-types
etc.


NOTE that the PC/PRONOM design suggests that * [<code>http://www.significantproperties.org.uk/</code>][32] 
will define the properties. * This WS can be used to get the
signature file: [<code>http://nationalarchives.gov.uk/pronom/service.asmx</code>][33] 
* This WS can be used to access tools etc: [<code>http://nationalarchives.gov.uk/pronom/characterisation.asmx</code>][34] 
* See [http://wiki.preserv.org.uk/index.php/PronomStubCode][35] 

## Potential Agenda Items for the TCC ##



 - Remit/purpose of the TCC.
 - How to find new items for this committee.
 - Effort allocation for the TCC. 1 day per month each?
 - Downward dissemination - where is the list of developers?
 - Coding standards and server code QA tools. _* Do we all need
them?_* Who should install and maintain them?
 - Contribute to the Glossary?
 - Data Model _* Who owns it, who changes it, how should it be
managed._* How should we test it, and how to get feedback.
 - Overall architecture documentation, by component?
 - Methods to ensure interoperability.
 - IDEA: Wiki staff list to use 'developer' instead of
'participant'.
 - IDEA: Inclusive dissemination plan? Beyond the Planets
Consortium?


# Preservation Services #



 - Deployment docs for individual services. Exp Magick.
 - Installed Java 5 (sdk) and set JAVA_HOME. Installed ImageMagick
from testing (lenny). and installed libmagick9-dev to provide the
headers. Check out JMagick. Configure and install. Add
/usr/local/lib to JAVA_OPTS.
 - Make it easier to deploy on any App Server? (spec planets jar
location?). [http://openejb.apache.org/][36]  on
Tomcat? Geronimo?


# Preservation Characterization #



 - MAJOR: Understand XC*L. Get it from Manfred and get it in core.
Cross-compile via NestedVM?
 - Look into building 'Collection Profiles'.
 - Sources:
 - MIME - IANA, Droid, JHOVE, NLNZ M.E. ...
 - XC*L - hamming distance and other metrics? make more sensitive
to fault types
 - How best to perform multi-file comparison? Pair-wise +
sort?
 - Make DB types understood by PC tools, and esp SIARD (a ZIP), to
enable workflows that use them.
 - Wrap W3C Validator.


# Preservation Action #



 - Migration discovery must be facilitated.
 - Note suggestions that cannot be fulfilled, yet.
 - XENA:
 - Also support normalized forms? Potentially lossy, and this
should be measured.
 - Attempt auto-discovery of OOF locations? /usr/lib/openoffice,
/opt/OpenOffice _._, /Applications/OpenOffice _._
 - Support PDF/A.
 - Sort out jar problem with the image.jar asplode.
 - CLWRAP?
 - Instead of all these tools wrapping simple programs, can we
create a more generic interface and use configuration files to
specify how to get from X to Y using command-line tool Z? This
system should automatically investigate if the command-line tool
exists.
 - ImageMagick would be a seperate Migrator service in the same
code base, as this can do a lot of automatic cleverness. 'convert
-list format'.
 - Tools:
 - Imagemagick, convert etc. See above.
 - SIARD or EMU, could result in migration or in a 'session'.
 - QC: Embed fonts via PDF driver, possibly in EMU.


## Action Types ##



 - Migration
 - Takes in a Digital Object and makes a new one, according to
some parameters.
 - Characterization
 - Identify: Determine Format, based on the Bytestream (extension
hinting is okay, but only hinting).
 - Validate: Test whether a Bytestream is consistent with a
specified Format. QA?
 - Assay/Analyse/Measure/Gauge/Mensuration/Mete: Measure some of
the properties of file.
 - Quality Control
 - Improves the Characteristics of a Digital Object without
changing it's Format.
 - Basically a Migration, aimed at removing problem
Characteristics, preservation risks etc.
 - Quality Assurance?
 - Service which Evaluates/Judges/Compares one or more Digital
Objects base on their Characteristics.
 - i.e. Value is used to Judge here, whereas other stuff is
Objective.
 - e.g. A comparator that compares the Characteristics of two
Digital Objects, in order to determine the degree of data
loss.
 - Validate should be listed here too.


# Preservation Planning #



 - Policy reaches down through the objective tree of Requirements,
and meets measurements are the leaves.
 - Determining sample content and getting it in is not trivial.
Working with next version of DROID on content profiling.
 - Turn Plato into an Experiment summary, if you want?
 - PP requires a lot of care, as easy to misunderstand the impact
of the choices made.
 - The missing choices might be the most important ones.
 - Registries to be neutral, but best practice will also be
required.
