Synopsis: On how the identified 'digital preservation community' is not alone, and indeed that concerns about longevity of information are held very widely, and have shaped what we have now.

About how formats are significant properties.

About how other groups fight the same battle under different banners (against lock-in etc.), or as enthusiasts.

About the remaining problems, and the role memory organizations can play by given permanence to the efforts of others.

Docker etc, up to and including reproducible systems, verifiable systems etc. [Revisiting How We Put Together Linux Systems](http://0pointer.net/blog/revisiting-how-we-put-together-linux-systems.html) - Good stuff in other projects, but seems to ignore the wider environment.

> "A simple format like Markdown creates documents you’ll have not trouble reading in twenty years. I’ve been teaching a survey course this semester and had a hell of a time reading my old notes from generals which I took using EndNote; with Markdown, any web browser, text editor, or Microsoft Word descendant will have no trouble opening it."

> "As a systemic property, sustainability applies to a complex whole. Business activity and the natural and social environment are interdependent and connected. You can’t have sustainability in one dimension without the other, for instance, you can’t have a sustainable economy without a sustainable environment."
