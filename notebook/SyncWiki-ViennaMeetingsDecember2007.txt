# Testbed 4 Kick-off (3rd-4th December) #



 - Plato and TheTestbed
 - The problem seems to arise because there is no language by
which the Plato tool can ask the Testbed what tools may preserve
it's Goals. Common language of significant properties
required?
 - Because Plato cannot formulate questions to the Testbed, it
subsumes the Testbed and asks its questions directly.
 - In turn, this restricts the questions Plato can ask, and they
end up being like those that the Testbed asks.
 - And Plato ends up Running Experiments to achieve this.
 - Plato should ask: 'This is my big collection. These are my
concerns (values of SP or more general?). Which Tools should I
use?'
 - Testbed should ask: 'This is my test collection. These are the
SP of interest. What are their values for when I use this
tool?'
 - What does Service Interfaces mean to *you*?
 - What does PLATO want the IF to support?
 - How do the Testbed team see the Conceptual Data Model?
Feedback?
 - *Andrewl:* Ask about requirements for a file selector to
integrate with his services.
 - What URIs can it take? file: only? http would be great.


# Interoperability Framework Quarterly Meeting (5th
December) #



 - Present current service interfaces ideas.
 - Outline interdependence between Service Interfaces, The
Registries and the Conceptual Data Model.
 - Security Requirements
 - TheTestbed needs simple Servlet Auth API. Could employ SSO or
DB, but need to integrate more roles.
 - TheTestbed requires three particular Roles, but these are not
supported by the Admin core. Where do they go?
 - *Markus:* Clarify the build environment, especially the
api and impl directories and implied classpaths.
 - Mention TheShepherd idea?
