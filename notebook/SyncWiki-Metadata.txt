This page includes my notes on software related to Planets, but
not directly part of it. These should probably each have their own
page. See also Existing tools for information extraction

## Magic numbers ##


Magic numbers is the name for the standard UNIX mechanism used
to identify file types. This approach is not limited to UNIX, but
is usually considered a UNIX related practice that has since spread
to many other platforms. The mechanism is based on a database that
maps byte strings and positions to file types. Common examples are
GIF, JPEG and TIFF, that all contain reliable markers, at least for
identifying the general file format. Minor version identification
(i.e., format characterization rather than format identification)
often requires a more sophisticated approach, e.g. parsing of
header structures. On a UNIX system, the magic number mechanism can
be accessed using the file command, e.g.:

<code> kb005264:~/Code/Graphics andersjohansen$ file
logo.png</code>

<code>logo.png: PNG image data, 64 x 64, 8-bit/color RGBA,
non-interlaced </code>

Advantages are fast performance and reliable identification for
many file formats. Limitations include that often minor version
variations can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be determined (i.e., less than
reliable characterization), that the method does not allow for
formats that lack reliable identification strings (such as text
files), and that it uncritically accepts the evidence (e.g., if a
text file contains the magic number for a GIF file, the file
command will identify it as a GIF file, regardless of other
evidence).

## DROID ##


DROID essentially uses an extended version of the magic numbers
approach, coupled with a web interface that provides access to a
database of reliable identification strings mapped to file types.
The DROID approach allows for some regular expressions in the
identification strings, as well as relative position of the
strings, rather than absolute (e.g., &acirc;&euro;&oelig;look for
0xB?DF00D 20 bytes before the end of the file&acirc;&euro;.

DROID is developed as part of the UK National Archives PRONOM
project, and can be obtained from [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/aboutapps/pronom/droid.htm][59] 

## JHOVE ##


JHOVE is an extensible, Java-based tool developed for the
JSTOR/Harvard Object Validation Environment ([http://www.jstor.org/][60] ) for the purpose
of reliably identifying and characterizing large sets of files,
primarily graphics files. Hence, the scope exceeds the traditional
magic number approach. The inner workings of the currently
available JHOVE modules is not described in the available
documentation, but presumably any approach can be used as long as
the interface for JHOVE modules is implemented. Based on the
available functionality for the available formats (primarily
graphics formats such as TIFF, GIF and JPEG) I conclude that a
combination of header parsing, hand crafted rules and magic numbers
are currently employed. JHOVE and companion documentation is
available at [http://hul.harvard.edu/jhove/][61] 

## Inferno ##


Inferno is a Java-based tool for rule inference and application
of such sets of rules. It is currently heavily biased towards
charcterization. It was developed at the Danish Royal Library by
Anders S. Johansen as a proof-of-concept for using rule inference
as an unifying approach to characterization, both directly to
perform characterization tasks, and indirectly to integrate results
from various existing characterization tools in an optimal way.

Inferno has been successfully applied to file and text string
characterization by text file encoding (Latin 1, UTF-8, UTF-16LE
and UTF-16BE), file type (text file encoding, JPEG and PNG) and
language used in text file (Danish, Swedish, English and
Norwegian).

A paper describing Inferno, rule inference and results of the
initial experiments is available [http://www.planets-project.eu/private/planets-ftp/Inferno.pdf][62] 
via the Planets FTP area. The abstracts is available at the
Preliminary Publications for PA/4 page.
