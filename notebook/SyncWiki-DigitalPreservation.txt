Digital Preservation is concerned with the storage of digital
resources using mechanism that will ensure access in
perpetuity.

# Scalable Preservation Plans #


I want to write a document that looks at the scalability of
different preservation approaches, and attempts to deal with the
migration v. emulation issue. Is it really scalable to migrate? Or
can we really cope with the every increasing range of formats? But
are the number of valid migration plans so small that it's not
worth worrying about, because almost everything else will require
emulation.

# Upgrading Planets #


The Planets code builds on a large number of software projects,
brought together via the JBoss application server. In the future,
we will need to keep these things up to date, and this bring sup a
number of issues.

_Should we clean up deployment procedure? *See Planets
Application Server for details of the current system.*Automatically
build the appserver from the JBoss/Apache/etc distribution
files._Upgrade Jackrabbit to 1.3.3. indicated as 1.3 but actually
1.3.1 at present. _Upgrade Derby version. 10.2.? should go up to
10.3.1.4_Upgrade JCR Explorer? *Document JCR deployment details.
(For upgrades).

# Web Services #


_The key to achieving the end goals is to define communication
standards for the DP community. This can outlast any particular
implementation, interface or tool set._Self-describing services -
[http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl#_documentation][35] 
__"*WSDL uses the optional wsdl:document element as a container
for human readable documentation. The content of the element is
arbitrary text and elements ("mixed" in XSD). The documentation
element is allowed inside any WSDL language element.*"_Human
tasks, with self-estimates, leads to 'Real' Gantt Charts - new
management model._[http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000236.shtml
WARC, Web ARChive file format][36] .

_Define Rights, not Roles, and let the Administrators build
Roles from Rights._JVM per work-flow, if work-flows are 'heavy'?
Provides resource usage restrictions. _UNDO etc_DOI-like
handle/name-space for Library versions of DOIs? _LIFE cost
assessment system is essentially like physics, looking for the
cleanest parameterisation._Clarify what is being evaluated! The
Experiment includes The Data??? _Filer interface via RO WebDAV
code?_Formats - are the variants of plain text documented
somewhere?


 - Standard Open Access Format - A standard for which the
documentation is freely available (at zero or marginal cost, no
licencing?) and which, perhaps in combination with other
SOStandards, is sufficient to allow the implementation of a (OAIS
Term) viewer/editor[???] from scratch, without reference to any
futher third party code or other IP.



 - What are the controls needed to perform experiments, the
uniform environment of Planets???


_We can use XSD to define our 'data types'. Generate Java from
that._We can proscribe Web Service structure, based on our data
types. _Note that adding a JCR/WebDAV frontend to Hadoop HDFS would
be sweet._Use WebDAV instead of JCR? Just wrap it in SSL and use
BASIC auth _[http://developers.sun.com/global/technology/standards/reference/faqs/determining-file-encoding.html
How Can I Determine the Encoding of a File?][43] _[http://www.coreservlets.com/JSF-Tutorial/
Java Server Faces tutorial][44] .

Services

_Pipes. Transforms. Processes. Steps. Functions. Mappers.
Tubes._Inputs: - File (also contains metadata - unique URI is
needed I think) _Outputs: - Metadata, or File (e.g. file in new
format) -_FileSet (e.g. separate pages) - Session (emulators
(SoftwareSession), viewers (BrowserSession), etc)

So, we have

_Characterisers, which generate XCDL,XCEL (characteristics in an
XML language)._Managers, which e.g. attach new metadata to files in
the store, and resolves any conflicts. _Migrators, which take a
File and return a File or FileSet in a new format, according to a
set of Parameters_Viewers, which result in a Session instead of a
File, perhaps a Browser or Emulator session

# Developer Notes Awaiting Their True Wiki Location #


_Serious failure: ERROR 42Y07: Schema 'PLANETSDBADMIN' does not
exist_Need to use deploy-all, not deploy-framework, to get started.
_Need to do a one-time 'ant db-create' in components/admin - then
login works._Two different versions of MyFaces:Tomahawk causing
problems on init. _Multiple different JAXB versions. OpenXML
version required for compilation_Mix of Java versions. *Some
objects lacking type-safe ggesting Java 1.4 or earlier.*Some parts
use annotations, therefore requiring Java 1.5+. __Note that
JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx512m is needed to run all this._A GUI for browsing
the contents of a Data Store is required - where will it be
done?_Extractors as a separate type of Migration? _Comparator
Service? Provided by Testbed?_Save Workflow needed?
_Register-this-service Service?_Exceptions and Reporting (Carl?)
_Note that if we allow pipes to be passed as arguments, we start to
enable full functional programming._[http://static.springframework.org/spring-ws/site/reference/html/tutorial.html
Spring Framework - Chapter 3. Writing Contract-First Web
Services][45]  _[http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html
Maven to control dependencies?][46] _[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DITA
Darwin Information Typing Architecture][47]  as a useful document
type.

_The 'Register This Service' Service - Catch-22?_Comparator
Service? Compares two lists of SigProps and returns the
'differences'? _SaveWorkflow as a service offered by some
component._Exceptions/Reporting - Carl to handle these.

__Are there standard WebService ways?_Document
DataRegistry/RepAPI/localJCR roles. (Not here,
yet)._http://news.zdnet.com/2100-1009_22-5345253.html Security
ideas???

_Search for User example in code. None?_Mail Thomas about
example of User lookup? _Write a Planets Architecture
Specification?_Write a Planets Component Developer Guide? To
include examples of using the shared code, e.g. user lookup. How to
secure that WS?! _Exec PPlan requires args: PPlan and
FileSet._NOTE: Ideally this will allow pass-by-value or pass-by-ref
for passing DigitalFiles between services. * Go through all of
these: [http://gforge.planets-project.eu/gf/project/if_sp/docman/][48] 
_Planets Software License should be a standard non-commercial
licence?_Java Coding Good Practice Guide should be linked in. _IF
Overview is a starting point for devdocs._IF Integration is a
starting point for the integration guide. *IF/Security should be
linked in, but is Acegi-based.

_TEST: 'ant all' does everything? including db-create?_ACTION:
Offer a Solaris build for CruiseControl? _NOTE: Ant stuff has to be
changed to enable CruiseControl to exe unit tests._NOTE: There is a
planets installer. _Security Layers - Code???, Web, Services,
Proxying down to Databases etc._Roles of components, e.g. Testbed
could test PreservationPlans from Plato against difficult Corpora,
e.g. nasty edge cases. _Types, subTypes and properties could be
useful? Is PRONOM enough? Only one XML type. Java Types with
SerializedForms instead?_Idea: XSLT service, takes XML and XML(XSLT
ns form), returns XML. _TechArch/_: Data Integrity. *Overwriting or
Deleting should be HARD.*Adding be easier. __Encourages
pipe-and-filter form._Intellectual Entities managed at the DR
level, everything else lower level?_TechReg Service, pro-forma
email to PRONOM to request a new format id?

_PLATO creates a Preservation Plan, including an Executable
Preservation Plan (BPEL), based on a subset of a Collection._The
Testbed should be capable of executing a EPP against some other
Collection Subset.


 - Scaling issues - how will estimation of scaling work?


_The Admin component appears to be based on [http://appfuse.org/
AppFuse][49] _[http://ode.apache.org/
Apache ODE][50]  provides a flexible BPEL engine.
