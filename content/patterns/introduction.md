# Patterns


Standards like the Open Archival Information Systems reference model can provide useful high-level frameworks, but cannot provide concrete guidance when it comes to how to actually implement a digital preservation program. At the other extreme, over the years the digital preservation community has done a good job of sharing information on local implementations and workflows (through conferences like [iPres](https://ipres-conference.org/), and via things the [Community Owned Workflows](https://coptr.digipres.org/index.php/Workflow:Community_Owned_Workflows) wiki). These individual reports are a rich source of information, but synthesising this information is a very difficult challenge for a newcomer to take on, as they are least well equipped to know how relevant or current any particular piece of work might be.

The [NDSA Levels of Digital Preservation](https://ndsa.org/publications/levels-of-digital-preservation/) have helped bridge this gap from the top down, by providing a concrete roadmap of goals. But any such universal path necessarily must remain abstracted away from the details that depend on context. And working from the bottom up, summaries of recent work, like the [Digital Preservation Coalition's Technology Watch Publications](https://www.dpconline.org/digipres/discover-good-practice/tech-watch-reports) provide very helpful in-depth summaries of known areas of interest.  But this is still a lot to work through, and it remains difficult to quickly find and filter through the wide range of information on different approaches, and understand how the details depend on your context. 

Is there some complementary format or framework that would allow us to navigate this gap, providing some kind of map that helps us find our place, and understand how our work should adapt to our context?



In this paper we have used the idea of design patterns as a way of capturing different choices that can be made when implementing a digital preservation process, focussing on overall information flow. The same tactic could also be applied to other aspects of digital preservation, such as:

- Communities: can we identify different classes of communities and environments, helping us understand how to engage with them?
- Ownership: is the archive part of the organisation that own the records, or do we hold records on behalf of others? How does this change what we need to do?
- Assessing Preservation Actions: what are the different meanings of Significant Properties, and what other methods can we used to assess our interventions?
- Archival Packaging Patterns: what are the different approaches to defining information packages.
- System Architectures: what are the different ways we can implement the OAIS functional requirements, i.e. which system or systems covering which functions?

Each of these sets of patterns is drawn from my own experience of working in digital preservation, in service delivery and research projects. But the world of digital preservation is much larger than that, so the question is what have I missed.

If your experiences cut across these classification (or if you think there are flaws in the whole approach!) {doc}`please let me know</about>`.
