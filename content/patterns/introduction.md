# Patterns


The approach to this is based on the idea that there are few universal _Best Practices_ in digital preservation. Rather, there is a wide range of valid practices and to choose between them we need to understand how they depend on the context you are working in.  


...

Each of these sets of patterns is drawn from my own experience of working in digital preservation, in service delivery and research projects. But the world of digital preservation is much larger than that, so the question is what have I missed.

If your experiences cut across these classification (or if you think there are flaws in the whole approach!) {doc}`please let me know</about>`.
