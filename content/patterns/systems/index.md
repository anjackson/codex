Library doesnt care about digital
Patterns
Ingest then transform over heavy pre-ingest processing

Bridge the gap between OAIS and practice, starting with the overall information architectures and different ways of delivering the OAIS functions.

## Risks / Implementation

Start with known, experienced risks, outline possible solutions that can be baked into the architectural design 

Policy versus structure 


## Actions

Note user-driven processing is common and better handles transient failure, extension to edge cases etc. Note pipeline approach is the same parts as this, in a different shape.

Also Just-in-time gives you more chances to get it right. Just-in-case is often only done once and itâ€™s harder to pick up problems. https://twitter.com/euanc/status/1223656274203742208
