# Introduction

What kinds of environments do archives operate in? How does this affect the way things work, and the communities the archive works with?

# Environments
 
## The OAIS Environment

The [Open Archival Information System (OAIS)][1] presents a simple model for the environment an archive operates in:

## Kinds of Environment

Audiences, internal archive, enchanced care of the same to the same audence. e.g. BBC Archive.


See [space-time plot]({{< ref "/asides/spacetime-plots" >}}) for examples.

### Direct

Crucially, this means the DIP is generated from the AIP...

Pipeline versus sidecar preservation

POINT: If your not generating your DIP from your actual AIP youâ€™re not doing OAIS.

Use digitised images as example. Look at risks of the sidecar approach. 



### Backup (via the publisher)

### Failover (via the published record)
