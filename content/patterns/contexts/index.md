# Contexts & Environments

What kinds of environments do archives operate in? How does this affect the way things work, and the communities the archive works with?

## The OAIS Environment

The [Open Archival Information System (OAIS)][1] presents a simple model for the environment an archive operates in:

## Kinds of Environment

Audiences, internal archive, enchanced care of the same to the same audence. e.g. BBC Archive.

Crucially, this means the DIP is generated from the AIP...

Pipeline versus sidecar preservation

POINT: If your not generating your DIP from your actual AIP youâ€™re not doing OAIS.

Use digitised images as example. Look at risks of the sidecar approach. 



### Backup (via the publisher)
