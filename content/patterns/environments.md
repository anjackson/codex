# Environments & Communities

One of the biggest reasons different organisations need different tactics is that they are actually trying to accomplish very different things. They operate in very different environments, work with very different communities, and consequently have very different goals.

Here we propose a basic set of environment patterns, each focused of a different community and relationship. This is followed by some examples, showing how the patterns appear and combine in different situations.

We start with the simple, abstract model presented by the [Open Archival Information System (OAIS)][^oais]:

```

OAIS captures the relationships at a high level, and deliberately so, so that it remains generally applicable across contexts. This approach shifts the focus to the definition of the _Designated Community_ the archive serves.

Working within this overall framework, it can be helpful to consider the possible relationships between the archive and _Management_, and it's _Producers_ and _Consumers_, and the wider organisation the archive belongs to. In other words, do the _Producers_ and _Consumers_ belong to the same organisation as the archive and it's _Management_? 

And of all those people, who gets to decide what these digital resources _mean_?

## Environment 1: The Archive

The first case to consider is where, in essence, our users are us.  Where those producing the digital records are also those consuming them, and where everyone operates under the same management structure. Where archive is the long-term memory of an organisation.

```

While _The Archive_ is a bit of a overloaded term, I think it's fair to say that this pattern is the closest to a strict interpretation of an _Archive_, in the sense of formal record keeping practices.

The crucial thing here is that _these are your records!_ Their meaning and purpose is defined by the people in your organisation. You are your own _Designated Community_.

In some ways, this makes things simpler. The context you share means the barriers to communication are potentially lower, at least in the medium term. Of course, knowledge management and loss due to things like staff turnover is a significant challenge, but this is true for every organisation, and the archive can be a part of that mitigation.

But if our digital records become inaccessible, perhaps through format obsolescence, or because the definitions in our digital models become confused and disconnected from the context, we have failed. An _Archive_ that cannot find and present it's own records cannot need it's users needs, cannot comply with legal requests, and as such puts itself and the wider organisation at risk.

When you an an _Archive_, you are responsible for judging the value and meaning of your records, and maintaining this over time, for as long as is required. Just keeping the bits and bytes in a big box is unacceptable -- you must know how to interpret them for access, both in terms of software for playback/rendering, and in terms of the meaning of the records.

## Environment 2: The Library

While this is also something of an overloaded term, I think the opposite extreme can be thought of as a _Library_.


```{image} images/_oais_environment_l.svg

```

Here, the OAIS archive is a distinct organisation.  The publishers and consumers are your audience, not your colleagues. 

Libraries are expected to not interpret, but this is in some conflict with selection. Libraries are expected to act as common carriers. Consumers are expected to interpret.


For digital preservation, this means the primary role of the library is to pass on what it's got, i.e. binary preservation is acceptable.  Archives are expected to maintain the meaning of the records, so have the authority to sign off on migrations.

This seems to be linked to the formats.  There are formats that are well-standardised, so we can say we can attempt to migrate or emulate without affecting the meaning because the layer we are operating at is well-known. Libraries still have no sign-off capability.  But for unusual formats, defined by the Producer (only? also chosen by?), we cannot meaningfully determine software interpretation, so cannot migrate/emulate?

_Not quite getting to the core point of understanding when binary-only is the right approach._

Role of validation, Postel's Wedge. Pipe or Producer.

Open Archives and Libraries have a much wider audience, which brings additional challenges.

## Kinds of Environment

Audiences, internal archive, enchanced care of the same to the same audence. e.g. BBC Archive.


### Direct 

![Space-time plot visualising events in the OAIS environment pattern.](./images/spacetime-context-direct.png)

Crucially, this means the DIP is generated from the AIP...

Pipeline versus sidecar preservation

POINT: If your not generating your DIP from your actual AIP youâ€™re not doing OAIS.

Use digitised images as example. Look at risks of the sidecar approach. 



### Backup (via the publisher)

### Failover (via the published record)

### NOT Flow 4: The Split [???]

```{glue:figure} flow_sidecar_dot

:name: "flow_sidecar_dot"

```

This is an audience/community/role pattern not a flow pattern.

#### The Preservation System

... Also a wider pattern the flow...






## Engagement

Approaches to community and patterns of engagement.

Twist of tooling towards distancing users. 

Have you ever been frustrated at not being able to talk to a person?

Look at item pages from lots of instiutions, where's the Reference Desk?

## Surveillance Capitalism

Separate page?

"Monitoring Designated Community"

...
To successfully maintain access to digital resources, all the stakeholders involved need to be in a position to make informed decisions.


i.e. Patterns are

- Surveillance. Watching.
- Broadcast. Speaking, not listening.
- Engagement. one-to-one, still not listening.
- Discourse? Listening.
