# Environments & Communities

One of the biggest reasons different organisations need different tactics is that they are actually trying to accomplish very different things. They operate in very different environements, work with very different communities, and consequently have very different goals.

What kinds of environments do archives operate in? How does this affect the way things work, the communities the archive works with, and what we should preserve?

## The OAIS Environment

The [Open Archival Information System (OAIS)][^oais] presents a simple model for the environment an archive operates in:

```{image} _oais_environment.svg
```

Note there is no 'AIP' at this level! As far as your communities are concerned, that's an implementation detail.

## Role/Authority? Responsibilities!

Postel's Wedge. Pipe or Producer. 



## Kinds of Environment

Audiences, internal archive, enchanced care of the same to the same audence. e.g. BBC Archive.


### Direct

Crucially, this means the DIP is generated from the AIP...

Pipeline versus sidecar preservation

POINT: If your not generating your DIP from your actual AIP youâ€™re not doing OAIS.

Use digitised images as example. Look at risks of the sidecar approach. 



### Backup (via the publisher)

### Failover (via the published record)

### NOT Flow 4: The Split [???]

This is an audience/community/role pattern not a flow pattern.

#### The Preservation System

... Also a wider pattern the flow...






## Engagement

Approaches to community and patterns of engagement.

Twist of tooling towards distancing users. 

Have you ever been frustrated at not being able to talk to a person?

Look at item pages from lots of instiutions, where's the Reference Desk?

## Surveillance Capitalism

Separate page?

"Monitoring Designated Community"

...
To successfully maintain access to digital resources, all the stakeholders involved need to be in a position to make informed decisions.


i.e. Patterns are

- Surveillance. Watching.
- Broadcast. Speaking, not listening.
- Engagement. one-to-one, still not listening.
- Discourse? Listening.
