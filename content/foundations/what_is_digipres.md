# What is digital preservation?

This book is intended for people who already know a bit about digital preservation and want to know more. But if you do need help getting started, here are some recommendations.

For a high-level overview, The [Wikipedia page on digital preservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_preservation) is okay, and [Ashley Blewer's](https://ashleyblewer.com/) [training slide decks](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/) (especially the [slides on Digital Preservation](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/digital-preservation.html#2), the [Open Archive Information System (OAIS) standard](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/oais.html#2) and ['fixity'](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/fixity.html#2)) provide a good introduction to some of the key terminology.  

The [Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC)](https://www.dpconline.org/) provide more [detailed resources](https://www.dpconline.org/digipres/what-is-digipres) like the [Digital Preservation Handbook](https://www.dpconline.org/handbook), while maintaining a keen focus on practical issues. 

I also _strongly_ recommend reading [The Theory and Craft of Digital Preservation](https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/theory-and-craft-digital-preservation) by [Trevor Owens](http://www.trevorowens.org/), particularly for those with a background in cultural heritage ([see here for the open access version](https://osf.io/preprints/lissa/5cpjt/)). This book does an excellent job of framing digital preservation as a craft to be honed, and positions these practices in the wider cultural heritage context while providing a concrete framework for making progress.

Curiously, there does not seem to be many equivalent publications for those coming to digital preservation from the information technology side [^itbooks] -- but be warned, even if you know a lot about IT, digital preservation requirements can be seem strange at first. These communication issues are usually more subtle than they seem, so be prepared to clarify what you mean by terms like 'archive'!

[^itbooks]: Any suggestions are very welcome!
