    "# The Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "This site is a place for me to explore specific issues relating to the preservation of digital resources, and attempt to map out how context affects preservation goals and tactics. As such, while I'll try to write as clearly as possible, some of it may make little sense unless you already know a bit about digital preservation. Rather than attempt to re-hash what others have already written so well, I will provide links to the works of those other authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outlinks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are already a number of good introductions to digital preservation in general.  For a high-level overview, The [Wikipedia page on digital preservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_preservation) and [Ashley Blewer's](https://ashleyblewer.com/) [training slide decks](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/) (especially the [slides on Digital Preservation](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/digital-preservation.html#2), [OAIS](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/oais.html#2) and [Fixity](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/fixity.html#2)) are good introductions to some of the key terminology.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The [Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC)](https://www.dpconline.org/) provide more [detailed resources](https://www.dpconline.org/digipres/what-is-digipres) like the [Digital Preservation Handbook](https://www.dpconline.org/handbook), while maintaining a keen focus on practical issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "For those with a background in cultural heritage, I would particularly recommend [The Theory and Craft of Digital Preservation](https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/theory-and-craft-digital-preservation) by [Trevor Owens](http://www.trevorowens.org/), which positions digital preservation in the wider cultural heritage context and to provide a concrete framework for making progress ([see here for the open access version](https://osf.io/preprints/lissa/5cpjt/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Curiously, there does not seem to be many equivalent publications for those coming to digital preservation from the information technology side -- even if you know a lot about IT, digital preservation requirements can be seem strange at first! \n",
    "\n",
    "## Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "Since starting out in computational physics, I've worked on a wide range of research projects, eventually leading me to digital preservation (helping build the [PLANETS Testbed](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/83) as part of the [PLANETS Project](https://www.planets-project.eu/)) and then web archiving (as the technical lead for the [UK Web Archive](https://www.webarchive.org.uk/), collaborating with other [IIPC](https://netpreserve.org/) members). This [trajectory](https://anjackson.net/2017/04/04/digipres-lessons-learned/) has given me a chance to find out about a lot of different digital preservation endeavours from a wide range of international institutions, as well as building up my own experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal here is then to leverage my technical background to focus on specific issues that deserve more detailed exploration, and to take advantage of the breadth of examples I've seen to look for common patterns and practices across a broad range of situations and contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In {doc}`/foundations`, I'll cover a few crucial concepts which I believe are universally applicable to digital preservation, whatever context you work in. I'll then use these concepts to describe the different digital preservation {doc}`/patterns` I've found. Each pattern has been sythesized from a set of practical experiences, based on the evidence provided in the {doc}`/practices` section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The site itself uses the [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) system, which means I can use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) to mingle prose and programming together. This is used to generate illustrations as well as providing concrete examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feedback\n",

    "\n",
    "## Where to begin?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, before getting into technicalities, lets take a look around {doc}`/foundations/the-village`.\n",
