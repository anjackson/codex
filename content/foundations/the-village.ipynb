    "### Meeting Places\n",
    "\n",
    "As the [Wikipedia list of digital preservation initiatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_digital_preservation_initiatives) shows, there are a _lot_ of potential meeting places.   Here, we briefly introduce a handful, but this cannot and should not be considered an exaustive list as it is heavily biased by my experiences. One of the things you'll need to work on is researching these organisations, to find out which ones might work for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conferences & Coalitions\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best ways to meet your peers is through the projects and events run by the various national and international organisations that have been set up to facilitate wider collaboration.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Both the [Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC)](https://www.dpconline.org/) and the U.S. [National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA)](http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/ndsa/) but a lot of work into supporting the digital preservation community.  They are both membership-based organisations, but make a lot of their work openly available.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also a number of initiatives supporting specific areas of interest, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The [Open Preservation Foundation](https://openpreservation.org/) with is a strong focus on supporting open source tools used in digital preservation.\n",
    "- The [International Internet Preservation Consortium](https://netpreserve.org/), focussed on web archiving both as a means and a target of digital preservation.\n",
    "- The [BitCurator Consortium](https://bitcurator.net/bitcurator-consortium/), supporting the use of open source digital forensics tools for preservation purposes.\n",
    "- The [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/) initiative in collaboration with [UNESCO](https://en.unesco.org/themes/information-preservation).\n",
    "- The [No Time To Wait](https://mediaarea.net/NoTimeToWait) conference series, focusing on audiovisual preservation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest digital preservation conference is [iPres](https://ipres-conference.org/). This is a good place to meet peers, but you should also look out for digital preservation tracks in conferences more closely related to your particular situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The #digipres Community\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside of the formal venues, there is a wider community of digital preservation practitioners who are keen to help support each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "For those able to work in the open and with a public profile, Twitter is a good option.  The [@digipresnews](https://twitter.com/digipresnews) account was set up to ensure important digital preservation blogs have a presence on Twitter, and as such, [the list of @digipresnews followers](https://twitter.com/digipresnews/followers) is a reasonable starting point.[^dpn] Another approach is to wander through the [#digipres](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23digipres) or [#DigitalPreservation](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DigitalPreservation) hashtag feeds, or start with [this DigiPres Twitter List](https://twitter.com/i/lists/98975653) by [David Underdown](https://twitter.com/DavidUnderdown9).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, there are a number of mailing lists that may help. The [JISC Digital Preservation Mailing List](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=DIGITAL-PRESERVATION) is one widely-used option, but as above, there are often more domain-specific lists that might be better depending on the question and the context (e.g. [Research Data Management](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=RESEARCH-DATAMAN), [Web Archiving](https://netpreserve.org/about-us/iipc-mailing-list/), [Digital Curation](https://groups.google.com/g/digital-curation), etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Twitter and mailing lists are good places to ask questions, it's not always easy to find out if you question has already been answered before, or to improve the answers over time.  This realisation lead to the creation of the [Digital Preservation Questions & Answers](https://qanda.digipres.org/), which was set up by some members of the #digipres community as a place to pool these useful tidbits over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as these forums, some members of the #digipres community has tried to build a shared information hub in the form of [digipres.org](https://www.digipres.org/).  There are a lot of digital preservation tools and information out there, and [digipres.org](https://www.digipres.org/) attempt to make sure you can find what you need!\n",
    "\n",
    "[^dpn]: But [@digipresnews was set up by me](http://anjackson.github.io/keeping-codes/practice/DigiPresNews.html), so take an appropriate pinch of salt!"

But this approach tends to abstract away the context in which preservation is taking place, which makes it harder to collaborate other people who are doing essentially the same thing but under slightly different circumstances.\n",
