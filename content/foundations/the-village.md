# The Village

You are not alone. This is fundamental.

Digital preservation is built on borderlands. On one side, the rapidly evolving _new world_ of modern information technology. On the other, the _ancient land_ of cultural heritage, of libraries and archives.

To work on digital preservation is to build a bridge between these worlds; to help each understand the other; to find common purpose and help both sides learn to build together. As the go-between, you must be the one to learn both languages. You will be the messenger, and we all know the dangers of being the messenger when the news is bad.

Living on the boundary can feel very lonely.

So, above all else, you must be supported by your manager. They will likely come from one of the two worlds, rather than growing up on the border, so may not perceive the risks.  If they don't, and they don't help you battle the loneliness, they do not deserve your labour. 

If management has your back, there's some more good news: there are a _lot_ of people like you.

## Kin

Many different organisations now recognise the importance of digital preservation, so while you may work in a team of only one or two individuals, there are other small teams in other organisations battling very similar problems.

They are your kin.

They may operate in different contexts, with different goals and contraints, but like you, they are go-betweens.  They are bilingual. They are learning as they go. They are finding common ground. Just like you.  If you can meet these like minds, you can help each other.

## Meeting Places

The [Digital Preservation Coalition](https://www.dpconline.org/) and the U.S. [National Digital Stewardship Alliance](http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/ndsa/)

There's a lots of other great Digital Preservation resources out there, and I'm also part of a collaborative project to try and link them all together -- go visit [digipres.org](https://www.digipres.org/) to see what we've done!

## Guides

There are already a number of good guides to digital preservation in general. In particular, for those with a background in cultural heritage, I would recommend:

- [DPCs Digital Preservation Handbook](https://www.dpconline.org/handbook)
- [The Theory and Craft of Digital Preservation](https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/theory-and-craft-digital-preservation) by [Trevor Owens](http://www.trevorowens.org/), to position digital preservation in the wider cultural heritage context and to provide a concrete framework for making progress ([see here for the open access version](https://osf.io/preprints/lissa/5cpjt/)).
- [Ashley Blewer's](https://ashleyblewer.com/) [training slide decks](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/), for an introduction to the main concepts and pointers.

Curiously, there does not seem to be many equivalent publications for those coming to digital preservation from the information technology side -- even if you know a lot about IT, digital preservation requirements can be seem strange at first!

Having said that, Ashley Blewer's [slides on Digital Preservation](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/digital-preservation.html#2) and related subjects (e.g. [OAIS](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/oais.html#2) and [Fixity](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/fixity.html#2)) are a good introduction to some of the key terminology.

To complement these broader works, the goal here is to focus on specific issues that deserve more detailed exploration, and to look for common patterns and practices across a broad range of situations and contexts.

One of my favorite digital preservation stories is: [It Takes a Village to Save a Hard Drive](https://web.archive.org/web/20130916000537/http://notepad.benfinoradin.info/2013/09/12/it-takes-a-village-to-save-a-hard-drive) -- it's a perfect illustration of what
