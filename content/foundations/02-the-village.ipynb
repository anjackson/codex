    "### Meeting Places\n",
    "\n",
    "As the [Wikipedia list of digital preservation initiatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_digital_preservation_initiatives) shows, there are a _lot_ of potential meeting places.   Here, I'm briefly introduce a handful of those that have helped me on my journey, but this cannot and should not be considered an exaustive list as it is heavily biased by my experiences. One of the things you'll need to work on is researching these organisations, to find out which ones might work for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conferences & Coalitions\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the ways to meet your peers is through the projects and events run by the various national and international organisations that have been set up to facilitate wider collaboration.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Both the [Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC)](https://www.dpconline.org/) and the U.S. [National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA)](http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/ndsa/) put a lot of work into supporting the digital preservation community.  They are both membership-based organisations, but make a lot of their work openly available.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also a number of initiatives supporting specific areas of interest, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The [Open Preservation Foundation](https://openpreservation.org/) with is a strong focus on supporting open source tools used in digital preservation.\n",
    "- The [International Internet Preservation Consortium](https://netpreserve.org/), focussed on web archiving both as a means and a target of digital preservation.\n",
    "- The [BitCurator Consortium](https://bitcurator.net/bitcurator-consortium/), supporting the use of open source digital forensics tools for preservation purposes.\n",
    "- The [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/) initiative in collaboration with [UNESCO](https://en.unesco.org/themes/information-preservation).\n",
    "- The [No Time To Wait](https://mediaarea.net/NoTimeToWait) conference series, focusing on audiovisual preservation.\n",
    "- The [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest digital preservation conference is [iPres](https://ipres-conference.org/). This is a good place to meet peers, but you should also look out for digital preservation tracks in conferences more closely related to your particular situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The #digipres Community\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside of the formal venues, there is a wider community of digital preservation practitioners who are keen to help support each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "For those able to work in the open and with a public profile, Twitter is a good option.  I [set up](http://anjackson.github.io/keeping-codes/practice/DigiPresNews.html) [@digipresnews](https://twitter.com/digipresnews) account was set up to ensure important digital preservation blogs have a presence on Twitter, and as such, [the list of @digipresnews followers](https://twitter.com/digipresnews/followers) is a reasonable starting point. Another approach is to wander through the [#digipres](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23digipres) or [#DigitalPreservation](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DigitalPreservation) hashtag feeds, or start with [this DigiPres Twitter List](https://twitter.com/i/lists/98975653) by [David Underdown](https://twitter.com/DavidUnderdown9).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, off social media, there are a number of mailing lists that may help. The [JISC Digital Preservation Mailing List](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=DIGITAL-PRESERVATION) is one widely-used option, but as above, there are often more domain-specific lists that might be better depending on the question and the context (e.g. [Research Data Management](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=RESEARCH-DATAMAN), [Web Archiving](https://netpreserve.org/about-us/iipc-mailing-list/), [Digital Curation](https://groups.google.com/g/digital-curation), etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Twitter and mailing lists are good places to ask questions, it's not always easy to find out if you question has already been answered before, or to improve the answers over time.  This realisation lead to the creation of the [Digital Preservation Questions & Answers](https://qanda.digipres.org/), which was set up by some members of the #digipres community as a place to pool these useful tidbits over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as these forums, some members of the #digipres community has tried to build a shared information hub in the form of [digipres.org](https://www.digipres.org/).  There are a lot of digital preservation tools and information out there, and [digipres.org](https://www.digipres.org/) attempt to make sure you can find what you need!"

    "## The Bad News\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things library Twitter folks like to ridicule is the endless stream of editorials about [\"the future of libraries\"](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22the+future+of+libraries%22&tbs=sbd:1,ar:1&tbm=nws&source=lnt&sa=X&biw=2003&bih=1027&dpr=2), usually written by someone who has seen an eBook once but never talked to a librarian.  There's usually little of value in these articles, but I think the fact that they _keep coming back_ does indicate that many still see libraries and archives through the prism of print.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, to be honest, I think there is some truth to that.  I think libraries and archives have been deeply disrupted by modern information technology, and we're still working through the consequences. I think our institutions have had _decades_ to become heavily optimized for handling print, and the modifications required to handle digital content are not yet fully understood. This problem manifests itself in a number of ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Underfunding \n",
    "\n",
    "Digital preservation is underfunded. _Hugely_ underfunded. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's certainly not the _only_ problem, by any means. But it _amplifies_ everything, like a microphone too close to the speaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cultural heritage sector has generally seen cuts upon cuts over recent years, rather than any kind of ongoing investment. This has meant organisations structured around preserving physical things straining to create a digital version of themselves, on small money, with and tiny teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of my favourite examples in recent years was [\"XFR STN\"](https://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/xfr-stn) (Transfer Station) -- an open-door artist-centred media archiving project -- and this blog post about it: [It Takes a Village to Save a Hard Drive](https://web.archive.org/web/20130916000537/http://notepad.benfinoradin.info/2013/09/12/it-takes-a-village-to-save-a-hard-drive). It perfectly illustrate the amazing potential of this kind of interdisciplinary work, but the `07/17–09/08/2013` dates buried in the FAQ very clearly illustrates the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do our best to help each other out, but it's important to recognise that this is a kind of coping mechanism -- a consequence of our mistreatment. We can support each other, but must also beware the dangers of [vocational awe](http://www.inthelibrarywiththeleadpipe.org/2018/vocational-awe/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fragmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "There is _so much_ to be done, all while fighting institutional inertia in order to get _anything_ done. This can leave us feeling undermined and embattled. The _\"like minds\"_ you find will be able to offer a sympathetic ear, and share their own experiences.  But there's a trap here. Venting shared frustrations brings you closer to those _outside_ your organisation, but can isolate you from those _inside_ it. _Misery loves company_, and it may linger too long.\n"

But this approach tends to abstract away the context in which preservation is taking place, which makes it harder to collaborate other people who are doing essentially the same thing but under slightly different circumstances.\n",
