Validation and the Halting Problem
----------------------------------
The software and the digital objects form the program.

In general, there are no shortcuts, you need to run fully to know for sure what the outcome will be.

Can get away with it by limiting document capabilities? And the Software?

Turing complete formal languages cannot be fully validated (only syntax)

Migration of languages cannot be validated.
