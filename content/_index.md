# Introduction

## What?

This [open source](https://github.com/digipresnet/digipresnet-site/) and open access site provides a set of practical resources for experimenting with tools and understanding issues related to digital preservation and web archiving.

The logo represents a self-perpetuating pattern known as a [glider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_(Conway%27s_Life)).

## Who?

My name is [Andrew Jackson](http://anjackson.net/) and I'm a physicist who now works in digital preservation and web archiving.

I got my start in digital preservation helping build the [PLANETS Testbed](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/83) as part of the [PLANETS Project](https://www.planets-project.eu/).  This new site is largely based on my ideas of what the PLANETS Testbed _should have been_.

I blogged a bit more about my background [here](https://anjackson.net/2017/04/04/digipres-lessons-learned/).


## Links

There's a lots of other great Digital Preservation resources out there, and I'm also part of a collaborative project to try and link them all together -- go visit [digipres.org](https://www.digipres.org/) to see what we've done!
