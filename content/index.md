# Welcome

Welcome to _digipres.net_, an [open source](https://github.com/digipresnet/digipresnet-site/) exploration of patterns and practices in digital preservation.

## Introduction

There are already a number of good guides to digital preservation in general. In particular, for those with a background in cultural heritage, I would recommend:

- [Ashley Blewer's](https://ashleyblewer.com/) [training slide decks](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/), for an introduction to the main concepts and pointers.
- [The Theory and Craft of Digital Preservation](https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/theory-and-craft-digital-preservation) by [Trevor Owens](http://www.trevorowens.org/), to position digital preservation in the wider cultural heritage context and to provide a concrete framework for making progress ([see here for the open access version](https://osf.io/preprints/lissa/5cpjt/)).

Curiously, there does not seem to be many equivalent publications for those coming to digital preservation from the information technology angle[^it] (please let me know it I'm mistaken -- see {doc}`/about` for contact details). Having said that, Ashley Blewer's [slides on Digital Preservation](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/digital-preservation.html#2) and related subjects (e.g. [OAIS](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/oais.html#2) and [Fixity](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/fixity.html#2)) are a good introduction to some of the key terminology.

To complement these broader works, the goal here is to focus on specific issues that deserve more detailed exploration, and to look for common patterns and practices across a broad range of situations and contexts. 

Consequently, we shall adopt an expansive and inclusive definition of digital preservation.  Collections large or small, preservation planned or accidental, whatever form those digital resources have taken and however they survived, there will be a lesson to be learned. We can understand how we might communicate with the future by looking at how it happened in the past.

## Practical Patterns

Whenever someone has a question about how best to preserve digital media, the answer is always the same: _It depends...[^depends]

But what does it depend on?

The goal of this guide is to look for patterns across a wide range of practical approaches to digital preservation, taking into account the various contexts and constraints involved.  These practical patterns can then be used to identify which approaches might work best in a given situation.

## Where To Begin?

One of the biggest reasons different organisations need different tactics is that they are actually trying to accomplish very different things. They operate in very different environements, work with very different communities, and consequently have very different goals.

Before we get into the details, we need to understand those different {doc}`/context/contexts`.

[^depends]: Indeed, this is something Trevor Owen's book introduces as a fundemental axiom of the craft of digital preservation.

[^it]: Even if you know a lot about IT, digital preservation requirements can be seem strange at first.
