# Welcome

Welcome to _digipres.net_, an [open source](https://github.com/digipresnet/digipresnet-site/) exploration of patterns and practices in digital preservation.

## Practical Patterns

There are already a number of good guides to digital preservation, and we hope to complement those broader works, rather than compete with them.[^1] The goal here is to focus on specific ideas and issues that deserve more detailed illustration and exploration.

Whenever someone has a question about how best to preserve digital media, the answer is always the same: _It depends..._

But what does it depend on?

The goal of this guide is to look for patterns across a wide range of practical approaches to digital preservation, taking into account the various contexts and constraints involved.  These practical patterns can then be used to identify which approaches might work best in a given situation.

## Where To Begin?

One of the biggest reasons different organisations need different tactics is that they are actually trying to accomplish very different things. They operate in very different environements, work with very different communities, and consequently have very different goals.

Before we get into the details, we need to understand those different {doc}`/context/contexts`.

[^1]: In particular, for those with a background in cultural heritage, I would recommend [The Theory and Craft of Digital Preservation by Trevor Owens](https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/theory-and-craft-digital-preservation) ([see here for the open access fill draft](https://osf.io/preprints/lissa/5cpjt/)).
