# Welcome

Welcome to _digipres.net_, an [open source](https://github.com/digipresnet/digipresnet-site/) guide to digital preservation.

## Practical Patterns

Whenever someone has a question about how best to preserve digital media, the answer is always the same: _It depends..._

But what does it depend on?

The goal of this guide is to look for patterns across a wide range of practical approaches to digital preservation, taking into account the various contexts and constraints involved.  These practical patterns can then be used to identify which approaches might work best in a given situation.
