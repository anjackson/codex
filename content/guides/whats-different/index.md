Digital preservation happens where a number of different established fields and communities meet.  There is much more digital preservation to be done than there are digital preservation roles to do it, but even if there is an excess of expertise on hand, the stakeholder group is much wider.  To successfully maintain access to digital resources, all the stakeholders involved need to be in a position to make informed decisions.

Different people from different backgrounds will have different assumptions about what digital preservation means and different conceptions of the goals. Even the same words are often used in significantly different ways, and these different points of view can make it difficult to be clear about the  roles and resposibilities involved when delivering a digital preservation service.

Here, we provide brief introductions highlighting what's different about digital preservation from different perspectives, and provide links on to more detailed explorations for those who want to know more.

So, what's different about digital preservation....

## Compared to preserving a non-digital collection?

Many archivists, curators and conservators are responsible for mixed collections, with a growing digital component.  To manage such collections, it's crucial to understand how digital resources are different from the more traditional items.  This doesn't necessarily change the higher-level concepts or processes through which items are managed, and indeed digital preservation models and standards (like OAIS) often highlight the similarities beween the two.  But to preserve this properly we need to focus on the understanding differences, just as a traditional conservator might follow particular practices for [stained glass](http://www.conservationregister.com/PIcon-carestainedglass.asp) or [plastics](http://www.conservationregister.com/PIcon-careplastics.asp).

Traditional conservation focusses on preserving the object, and much of the digital preservation literature tends to echo this framing by asserting that we are "preserving digital objects". However, it's more accurate to say that preserving _access_ to digital resources, because we are preserving the ability to perform an act, an interaction. Not simply a _thing_.

In truth, we're always preserving access to our collections, it's just in most cases we don't need to think about it. Access to simple printed materials like books just needs little more light and space. Unusual items might require more mediation. Very large or fragile items might need additional equipment and processes to ensure safe handling. More ancient, obsure or obtuse works may require expert guidance, advice and explanation. These kinds of access support systems become so familiar that they become _part of the furniture_, often literally! The processes to manage and maintain access get absorbed into shared practices, often spread across multiple teams with different responsibilities for different aspects of the access system. 

One tiny but valuable example are the request slips used to manage access to printed items at the British Library, as shown in this video called "Journey of a collection item"...

Using slips of paper to keep track of where items are! How simple! How obvious!

Well, it is now. But it's not really that simple, it's just familiar. At some point in the past this process was _designed_. The risks were analysed  and the mitigations put in place. We've had many, many years to work on handling print. We're still learning how to manage digital resources. But worse than that, we're still in the process of working out if it's possible reach that level of standardisation _at all_. It's possible that the nature of digital media means that we will never be able to 'solve' digital access and preservation in the same way.

We can start to understand this problem by looking at the increasing complexity of digital media over time.

An example of very early digital media are the punched cards used by [Jacquard looms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_machine) or [Pianolas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_piano).  These are digital media, but for programming non-digital machines, and to play them back you need the right machine. So, despite being digital, they arent' really any any diffent to an record player....
