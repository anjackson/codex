# What's Different About Digital Preservation?

'Different answers for different people.'

Digital preservation happens where a number of already-established communities meet. But as we join forces, we bring our preconceptions with us. 

Different people from different backgrounds will have different assumptions about what digital preservation means and different conceptions of the goals. Even the same words may be used in significantly different ways, and these different points of view can make it difficult to be clear about the roles and resposibilities involved when delivering a digital preservation service.

In an attempt to break down these barriers, this page presents multiple introductions to digital preservation, and provide links on to more detailed explorations for those who want to know more.

Each written with a different audience in mind, but you are encourage to read them all, to we can understand eachothers points of view.

So, what's different about digital preservation....

## Compared to traditional conservation?

Many archivists, curators and conservators are responsible for mixed collections, with a growing digital component.  This doesn't necessarily change the higher-level concepts or processes through which items are managed -- indeed digital preservation models and standards (like OAIS) often highlight the similarities beween the two.  But to preserve digital resources _properly_ we need to understand what makes digital different, just as we might follow particular practices for [stained glass](http://www.conservationregister.com/PIcon-carestainedglass.asp) or [plastics](http://www.conservationregister.com/PIcon-careplastics.asp).

Traditional conservation focusses on preserving the object, and much of the digital preservation literature tends to echo this framing by asserting that we are "preserving digital objects". However, it's more accurate to say that preserving _access_ to digital resources, because we are preserving the ability to perform an act, an interaction. Not simply a _thing_.

In truth, we're always preserving access to our collections, it's just in most cases we don't need to think about it -- access to simple printed materials like books just needs little more light and space. But other media are more complex. Audio and video recordings usually require specific equipment to play them, but we can preserve the media and the playback equipment for many years. Preserving objects still works!

But most digital resources are not like this. Because what makes digital resources different is that they depend on _software_.

The modern, networked computer is a medium all of it's own, and computer software is a kind of _meta-medium_: a medium for writing media. They can _act like_ a CD player, or a piano, or an alien planet, or a Post-It note.  The limits are set only by the the hardware the computer uses to interact with the outside world, like the keyboard and the screen.

Whereas, despite being digital, a CD player can never become a general-purpose computer, any more than a Gramaphone can become a lathe. That freedom is the digital difference. But his freedom brings new challeges.

We're not keeping objects, we're storing signals, and we need to learn what this means for storage and collection management. And these signals need interpretation, which means we're also in the business of preserve software. On top of that, just as the modern users of an ancient book may require expert guidance, we will need to prepare ourselve to support our users as they explore our digital collections.
