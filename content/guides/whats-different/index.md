There is much more digital preservation to be done than there are digital preservation roles to do it, but even if there is an excess of expertise on hand, the stakeholder group is much wider.  To successfully maintain access to digital resources, all the stakeholders involved need to be in a position to make informed decisions.

Different people from different backgrounds will have different assumptions about what digital preservation means and different conceptions of the goals. Even the same words are often used in significantly different ways, and these different points of view can make it difficult to be clear about the  roles and resposibilities involved when delivering a digital preservation service.
