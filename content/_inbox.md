Rough notes and ideas

[Which checksum algorithm does everyone use? Introducing the NDSA Fixity Survey Report](https://www.dpconline.org/blog/wdpd/jmitcham-wdpd21)



In _Foundations_, I'll cover a few crucial concepts which I believe are universally applicable to digital preservation, whatever context you work in. 

I'll then build on these concepts to describe the different digital preservation _Patterns_ I've found, mapping out how context affects preservation goals and tactics. 

Each pattern has been sythesized from a set of practical experiences, examples of which are evidenced in the _Practices_ section.

This belongs in systems breakdown: AIP noun/verb, AIP is what it is, versus AIP the role it plays.
Something something actually this makes sense because the SIP is what crosses the boundary, it's all AIP, and also because 
you want the Thing (AIP and DIP) to survive longer than any particular repostory system.

## Patterns

- [Environments](/0uzg_74xScq_aZ7ouAvvBA)
- [Information Flow](/JAck46DsQrCHUbxV4IENAg)
    - Missing "it's not about _when_"???
    - _TO BE CHECKED_
- Assessing Preservation Actions 
    - _TO BE TRANSFERRED_
- Archival Information Package Design:
    - AIP == SIP+, AIP == SIP- or AIP-is-wrapped-SIP, AIP-is-cleaned-up-SIP, 
    - Pointing out or pointing in
    - All-in-one or modular
    - Files or Files + DB
- The Museum and the Zoo, 
    - Postels Wedge (that's the overall organisations role)
    - Data Flow (that's whether we do up-front cleaning or access-time?), 
    - related to Perfection of the Museum.
- Systems

## Cataloging

### Examples

#### GOV.UK vs The British Library

The story about the tension between user-research-driven classification and LCSH/classic library stuff.

Links to issue of literary warrant.

#### Catalogers vs Developers

Story about that argument that came down to transcription vs normalisation of dates.
