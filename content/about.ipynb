    "\n",
    "My name is [Andrew Jackson](http://anjackson.net/). I started out as a physicist, but in 2007 I switched to working in digital preservation and web archiving at the British Library. I got my start in digital preservation helping build the [PLANETS Testbed](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/83) as part of the [PLANETS Project](https://www.planets-project.eu/). I blogged a bit more about my background [here](https://anjackson.net/2017/04/04/digipres-lessons-learned/). \n",

    "I'm particularly interested in gathering stories about real digital preservation processes and practices that either align or break the patterns I'm proposing here. Ideally, this would include links to papers or blogs that present these practices in some detail, but any stories of realistic examples are very welcome. If they get included I will credit you appropriately, or keep them anonymous if you prefer.\n",

    "The idea of design patterns for digital preservation was first presented at [iPres2022](https://inconference.eventsair.com/ipres-2022/) as a short paper called [_Design Patterns in Digital Presevation -- Understanding Information Flows_](https://osf.io/pyz5c/) (there is also [a recording of the presentation I gave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtQqq5XLVC4)). That paper won the _Angela Dappert Memorial Prize_ for the best combination of research and practice in digital preservation at iPres 2022 ([announcement](https://www.dpconline.org/news/celebrating-outstanding-contributions-to-ipres-2022))."

    "\n",
    "This site uses the [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) system, which mean some pages can use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) to mingle prose and programming together. This is used to generate illustrations as well as provide concrete examples. You won't need to be able to understand the code to make sense of things, but they are easy to run and play about with if you're curious.\n",
