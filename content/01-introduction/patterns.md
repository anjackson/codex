# Practical Patterns

Whenever someone has a question about how best to preserve digital media, the answer is always the same: _It depends..._[^depends]

But what does it depend on?

Here, we take a bottom-up approach to answering this question, looking for patterns across a wide range of practical approaches to digital preservation, taking into account the various contexts and constraints involved.  These practical patterns can then be used to identify which approaches might work best in a given situation.

## Where To Begin?

One of the biggest reasons different organisations need different tactics is that they are actually trying to accomplish very different things. They operate in very different environements, work with very different communities, and consequently have very different goals.

Before we get to the preservation part, we need to understand those different {doc}`/context/contexts`.



[^depends]: Indeed, this is something Trevor Owen's book introduces as a fundemental axiom of the craft of digital preservation.
