# Introduction

There are already a number of good guides to digital preservation in general. In particular, for those with a background in cultural heritage, I would recommend:

- [Ashley Blewer's](https://ashleyblewer.com/) [training slide decks](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/), for an introduction to the main concepts and pointers.
- [The Theory and Craft of Digital Preservation](https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/theory-and-craft-digital-preservation) by [Trevor Owens](http://www.trevorowens.org/), to position digital preservation in the wider cultural heritage context and to provide a concrete framework for making progress ([see here for the open access version](https://osf.io/preprints/lissa/5cpjt/)).

Curiously, there does not seem to be many equivalent publications for those coming to digital preservation from the information technology side[^it] (please let me know it I'm mistaken -- see {doc}`/01-introduction/about` for contact details). Having said that, Ashley Blewer's [slides on Digital Preservation](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/digital-preservation.html#2) and related subjects (e.g. [OAIS](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/oais.html#2) and [Fixity](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/fixity.html#2)) are a good introduction to some of the key terminology.

To complement these broader works, the goal here is to focus on specific issues that deserve more detailed exploration, and to look for common patterns and practices across a broad range of situations and contexts. 

Consequently, we shall adopt an expansive and inclusive definition of digital preservation.  Collections large or small, preservation planned or accidental, whatever form those digital resources have taken and however they survived, there are lessons to be learned.

[^it]: Even if you know a lot about IT, digital preservation requirements can be seem strange at first.
