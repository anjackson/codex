## Patterns

In this paper we have used the idea of design patterns as a way of capturing different choices that can be made when implementing a digital preservation process, focussing on overall information flow. The same tactic could also be applied to other aspects of digital preservation, such as:

- Communities: can we identify different classes of communities and environments, helping us understand how to engage with them?
- Ownership: is the archive part of the organisation that own the records, or do we hold records on behalf of others? How does this change what we need to do?
- Assessing Preservation Actions: what are the different meanings of Significant Properties, and what other methods can we used to assess our interventions?
- Archival Packaging Patterns: what are the different approaches to defining information packages.
- System Architectures: what are the different ways we can implement the OAIS functional requirements, i.e. which system or systems covering which functions?
