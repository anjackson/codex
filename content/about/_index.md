## Who?

My name is [Andrew Jackson](http://anjackson.net/) and I'm a physicist who now works in digital preservation and web archiving.

## What?

This is my attempt to create a set of practical resources for experimenting with tools and understanding issues related to digital preservation and web archiving.

## Links

There's a lots of other great Digital Preservation resources out there, and I'm also part of a collaborative project to try and link them all together.  Go visit [digipres.org](https://www.digipres.org/) to see what we've done!
