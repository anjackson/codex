# Welcome to digipres.net

The goal of this site is to help you explore the different tactics you can use to better preserve digital content, and understand what approaches might work best in your particular context.  It is intended help bridge the gap between abstract, high-level models (like the [Open Archival Information System reference model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Archival_Information_System)) and the gritty details of getting preservation done (as we see in [iPres](https://ipres-conference.org/) papers, or on the [Community Owned Workflows](https://coptr.digipres.org/index.php/Workflow:Community_Owned_Workflows) wiki).
