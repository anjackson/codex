Whenever someone has a question about preserving digital content, the answer is always the same: 

_It depends..._

But what does it depend on?

Our goal is to take a bottom-up approach to answering this question, looking for patterns across a wide range of different practical approaches to digital preservation, taking into account the various contexts and constraints involved.  These practical patterns can then be used to identify which tactics might work best in a given situation. 

We adopt an expansive definition of digital preservation.  Collections large or small, preservation _planned or accidental_, whatever form those digital resources have taken and however they survived, there are lessons to be learned.
