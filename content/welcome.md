# Welcome to digipres.net

The goal of this site is to help you explore the different tactics you can use to better preserve digital content, and understand what approaches might work best in your particular context.  It is intended help bridge the gap between abstract, high-level models (like the [Open Archival Information System reference model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Archival_Information_System)) and the gritty details of getting preservation done (as we see in [iPres](https://ipres-conference.org/) papers, or on the [Community Owned Workflows](https://coptr.digipres.org/index.php/Workflow:Community_Owned_Workflows) wiki).

## Design Patterns for Digital Preservation

Whenever someone has a question about preserving digital content, the answer is always the same: 

_It depends..._

But what does it depend on?

My goal is to take a bottom-up approach to answering this question, looking for patterns across a wide range of different practical approaches to digital preservation, taking into account the various contexts and constraints involved.  These practical patterns can then be used to identify which tactics might work best in a given situation. 

This demands an expansive definition of digital preservation:  collections large or small, preservation _planned or accidental_, whatever form those digital resources have taken and however they survived, there are lessons to be learned.
