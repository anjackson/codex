## What's the plan?

Whenever someone has a question about how best to preserve digital resources, the answer is always the same: 

_It depends..._ [^dep]

But what does it depend on?

Our goal is to take a bottom-up approach to answering this question, looking for patterns across a wide range of practical approaches to digital preservation, taking into account the various contexts and constraints involved.  These practical patterns can then be used to identify which approaches might work best in a given situation. 

To make this work, we adopt an expansive and inclusive definition of digital preservation.  Collections large or small, preservation planned or accidental, whatever form those digital resources have taken and however they survived, there are lessons to be learned.

## Who made this?

My name is [Andrew Jackson](http://anjackson.net/) and I'm a physicist who now works in digital preservation and web archiving. I got my start in digital preservation helping build the [PLANETS Testbed](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/83) as part of the [PLANETS Project](https://www.planets-project.eu/). I blogged a bit more about my background [here](https://anjackson.net/2017/04/04/digipres-lessons-learned/). If you have any feedback about this site, you can contact me:

[^dep]: Indeed, this is something Trevor Owen's book (see {doc}`/foundations/the-village`) introduces as a fundemental axiom of the craft of digital preservation.
