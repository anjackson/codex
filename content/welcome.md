To a newcomer to digital preservation, it must seem like every question has the same answer: _"it depends..."_. 

But what does the answer depend on? What are the contextual factors that affect our decisions?

Here, I propose that a practice-driven approach is needed in order to answer this question. Specifically, one where concrete experiences of implementing digital preservation processes are drawn together based on common patterns, thereby allowing the common contextual factors to be revealed.
