# Welcome

Welcome to _digipres.net_, an [open source](https://github.com/digipresnet/digipresnet-site/) exploration of patterns and practices in digital preservation.

A place to gather examples of different digital preservation approaches and experiences, looking for patterns.


## Patterns

Whenever someone has a question about how best to preserve digital media, the answer is always the same: _It depends..._ Indeed, this is something Trevor Owen's book introduces as a fundemental axiom of the craft of digital preservation.

But what does it depend on?

Here, we take a bottom-up approach to answering this question, looking for patterns across a wide range of practical approaches to digital preservation, taking into account the various contexts and constraints involved.  These practical patterns can then be used to identify which approaches might work best in a given situation.

## Who made this?

My name is [Andrew Jackson](http://anjackson.net/) and I'm a physicist who now works in digital preservation and web archiving.

I got my start in digital preservation helping build the [PLANETS Testbed](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/83) as part of the [PLANETS Project](https://www.planets-project.eu/).  This new site is largely based on my ideas of what the PLANETS Testbed _should have been_.

I blogged a bit more about my background [here](https://anjackson.net/2017/04/04/digipres-lessons-learned/).

## What else is out there?

There's a lots of other great Digital Preservation resources out there, and I'm also part of a collaborative project to try and link them all together -- go visit [digipres.org](https://www.digipres.org/) to see what we've done!

There are already a number of good guides to digital preservation in general. In particular, for those with a background in cultural heritage, I would recommend:

- [Ashley Blewer's](https://ashleyblewer.com/) [training slide decks](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/), for an introduction to the main concepts and pointers.
- [The Theory and Craft of Digital Preservation](https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/theory-and-craft-digital-preservation) by [Trevor Owens](http://www.trevorowens.org/), to position digital preservation in the wider cultural heritage context and to provide a concrete framework for making progress ([see here for the open access version](https://osf.io/preprints/lissa/5cpjt/)).

Curiously, there does not seem to be many equivalent publications for those coming to digital preservation from the information technology side -- even if you know a lot about IT, digital preservation requirements can be seem strange at first!

Having said that, Ashley Blewer's [slides on Digital Preservation](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/digital-preservation.html#2) and related subjects (e.g. [OAIS](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/oais.html#2) and [Fixity](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/fixity.html#2)) are a good introduction to some of the key terminology.

To complement these broader works, the goal here is to focus on specific issues that deserve more detailed exploration, and to look for common patterns and practices across a broad range of situations and contexts. 

Consequently, we shall adopt an expansive and inclusive definition of digital preservation.  Collections large or small, preservation planned or accidental, whatever form those digital resources have taken and however they survived, there are lessons to be learned.
