# About

## Who made this?

My name is [Andrew Jackson](http://anjackson.net/) and I'm a physicist who now works in digital preservation and web archiving. I got my start in digital preservation helping build the [PLANETS Testbed](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/83) as part of the [PLANETS Project](https://www.planets-project.eu/). I blogged a bit more about my background [here](https://anjackson.net/2017/04/04/digipres-lessons-learned/). If you have any feedback about this site, you can contact me:

- on Twitter [@anjacks0n](https://twitter.com/anjacks0n)
- or via [email](mailto:anj@anjackson.net)


As such, while I'll try to write as clearly as possible, some of it may make little sense unless you already know a bit about digital preservation. To fill that gap, rather than re-hash what others have already written so well, I'll suggest some links to get you started...

## Outlinks

There are already a number of good introductions to digital preservation in general.  For a high-level overview, The [Wikipedia page on digital preservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_preservation) is okay, and [Ashley Blewer's](https://ashleyblewer.com/) [training slide decks](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/) (especially the [slides on Digital Preservation](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/digital-preservation.html#2), [OAIS](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/oais.html#2) and [Fixity](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/fixity.html#2)) provide a good introduction to some of the key terminology.  

The [Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC)](https://www.dpconline.org/) provide more [detailed resources](https://www.dpconline.org/digipres/what-is-digipres) like the [Digital Preservation Handbook](https://www.dpconline.org/handbook), while maintaining a keen focus on practical issues. 

For those with a background in cultural heritage, I would particularly recommend [The Theory and Craft of Digital Preservation](https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/theory-and-craft-digital-preservation) by [Trevor Owens](http://www.trevorowens.org/), which positions digital preservation in the wider cultural heritage context and to provide a concrete framework for making progress ([see here for the open access version](https://osf.io/preprints/lissa/5cpjt/)).

Curiously, there does not seem to be many equivalent publications for those coming to digital preservation from the information technology side [^itbooks] -- but be warned, even if you know a lot about IT, digital preservation requirements can be seem strange at first! These communication issues are usually more subtle than they seem.

[^itbooks]: Any suggestions are very welcome!


## Interactive notebooks

This site uses the [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) system, which means I can use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) to mingle prose and programming together. This is used to generate illustrations as well as provide concrete examples. You won't need to be able to understand the code to make sense of things, but they are easy to run and play about with if you're curious.

Here's a simple example, showing the frozen output of a simple command:

```python
print("Hello world...")
```

As it is, it can't _do_ anything. It just shows what was done.

To make it possible to re-run it, you can click the little rocket icon at the top of the page and choose where to run the [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) that corresponds to the current page. This brings up a menu that looks like this:
 
 ```{image} ../images/launch-this-page.png
:alt: Launch This Page
:width: 250px
:align: center
```

I recommend using the [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) option, but note that any edits you make there cannot be saved (easily). If you have a Google account then the [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) can be handy as on there the notebooks can be saved and indeed edited collaboratively. 

Either way, you should end up with a _'live'_ copy of a page that you can play with.
