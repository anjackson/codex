# About

## Who made this?

My name is [Andrew Jackson](http://anjackson.net/) and I'm a physicist who now works in digital preservation and web archiving. I got my start in digital preservation helping build the [PLANETS Testbed](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/83) as part of the [PLANETS Project](https://www.planets-project.eu/). I blogged a bit more about my background [here](https://anjackson.net/2017/04/04/digipres-lessons-learned/). If you have any feedback about this site, you can contact me:

- on Twitter [@anjacks0n](https://twitter.com/anjacks0n)
- or via [email](mailto:anj@anjackson.net)




As such, while I'll try to write as clearly as possible, some of it may make little sense unless you already know a bit about digital preservation. To fill that gap, rather than re-hash what others have already written so well, I'll suggest some links to get you started...

## Outlinks

There are already a number of good introductions to digital preservation in general.  For a high-level overview, The [Wikipedia page on digital preservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_preservation) is okay, and [Ashley Blewer's](https://ashleyblewer.com/) [training slide decks](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/) (especially the [slides on Digital Preservation](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/digital-preservation.html#2), [OAIS](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/oais.html#2) and [Fixity](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/fixity.html#2)) provide a good introduction to some of the key terminology.  

The [Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC)](https://www.dpconline.org/) provide more [detailed resources](https://www.dpconline.org/digipres/what-is-digipres) like the [Digital Preservation Handbook](https://www.dpconline.org/handbook), while maintaining a keen focus on practical issues. 

For those with a background in cultural heritage, I would particularly recommend [The Theory and Craft of Digital Preservation](https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/theory-and-craft-digital-preservation) by [Trevor Owens](http://www.trevorowens.org/), which positions digital preservation in the wider cultural heritage context and to provide a concrete framework for making progress ([see here for the open access version](https://osf.io/preprints/lissa/5cpjt/)).

Curiously, there does not seem to be many equivalent publications for those coming to digital preservation from the information technology side [^itbooks] -- but be warned, even if you know a lot about IT, digital preservation requirements can be seem strange at first! These communication issues are usually more subtle than they seem.

[^itbooks]: Any suggestions are very welcome!
