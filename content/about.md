# About

## Who made this?

My name is [Andrew Jackson](http://anjackson.net/) and I'm a physicist who now works in digital preservation and web archiving.

I got my start in digital preservation helping build the [PLANETS Testbed](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/83) as part of the [PLANETS Project](https://www.planets-project.eu/).  This new site is largely based on my ideas of what the PLANETS Testbed _should have been_.

I blogged a bit more about my background [here](https://anjackson.net/2017/04/04/digipres-lessons-learned/).

## What's with the weird logo?

The logo represents a self-perpetuating pattern known as a [glider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_(Conway%27s_Life)).

## What else is out there?

There's a lots of other great Digital Preservation resources out there, and I'm also part of a collaborative project to try and link them all together -- go visit [digipres.org](https://www.digipres.org/) to see what we've done!
