# About this site

## What's this about?

The goal is to help you preserve and maintain access to digital resources, whether you are handling digitised versions of print materials or born-digital content. 

The approach to this is based on the idea that there are few universal _Best Practices_ in digital preservation. Rather, there is a wide range of valid practices and to choose between them we need to understand how they depend on the context you are working in.  

This site aims to gather together different design patterns, based on real world examples. The patterns and the contextual factors they depend on can then be used to map of the landscapes we work in, and help us find our path.

## What's this _not_ about?

This book is _not_ intended for absolute beginners, but for people who already know a bit about digital preservation and want to know more. But if you do need help getting started, here are some recommendations.

For a high-level overview, The [Wikipedia page on digital preservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_preservation) is okay, and [Ashley Blewer's](https://ashleyblewer.com/) [training slide decks](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/) (especially the [slides on Digital Preservation](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/digital-preservation.html#2), the [Open Archive Information System (OAIS) standard](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/oais.html#2) and ['fixity'](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/fixity.html#2)) provide a good introduction to some of the key terminology.  

The [Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC)](https://www.dpconline.org/) provide more [detailed resources](https://www.dpconline.org/digipres/what-is-digipres) like the [Digital Preservation Handbook](https://www.dpconline.org/handbook), while maintaining a keen focus on practical issues. 

I also _strongly_ recommend reading [The Theory and Craft of Digital Preservation](https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/theory-and-craft-digital-preservation) by [Trevor Owens](http://www.trevorowens.org/), particularly for those with a background in cultural heritage ([see here for the open access version](https://osf.io/preprints/lissa/5cpjt/)). This book does an excellent job of framing digital preservation as a craft to be honed, and positions these practices in the wider cultural heritage context while providing a concrete framework for making progress.

Curiously, there does not seem to be many equivalent publications for those coming to digital preservation from the information technology side [^itbooks] -- but be warned, even if you know a lot about IT, digital preservation requirements can be seem strange at first. These communication issues are usually more subtle than they seem, so be prepared to clarify what you mean by terms like 'archive'!

[^itbooks]: Any suggestions are very welcome!


## Who made this?

My name is [Andrew Jackson](http://anjackson.net/) and I'm a physicist who now works in digital preservation and web archiving. I got my start in digital preservation helping build the [PLANETS Testbed](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/83) as part of the [PLANETS Project](https://www.planets-project.eu/). I blogged a bit more about my background [here](https://anjackson.net/2017/04/04/digipres-lessons-learned/). If you have any feedback about this site, you can contact me:

- on Mastodon [@anj@digipres.club](https://digipres.club/@anj)
- on Twitter [@anjacks0n](https://twitter.com/anjacks0n)
- or via [email](mailto:anj@anjackson.net)


As such, while I'll try to write as clearly as possible, some of it may make little sense unless you already know a bit about digital preservation. To fill that gap, rather than re-hash what others have already written so well, I'll suggest some links to get you started...


## Interactive notebooks

This site uses the [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) system, which means I can use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) to mingle prose and programming together. This is used to generate illustrations as well as provide concrete examples. You won't need to be able to understand the code to make sense of things, but they are easy to run and play about with if you're curious.

Here's a simple example, showing the frozen output of a simple command:

```python
print("Hello world...")
```

As it is, it can't _do_ anything. It just shows what was done.

To make it possible to re-run it, you can click the little rocket icon at the top of the page and choose where to run the [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) that corresponds to the current page. This brings up a menu that looks like this:
 
 ```{image} ./images/launch-this-page.png
:alt: Launch This Page
:width: 250px
:align: center
```

I recommend using the [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) option, but note that any edits you make there cannot be saved (easily). If you have a Google account then the [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) can be handy as on there the notebooks can be saved and indeed edited collaboratively. 

Either way, you should end up with a _'live'_ copy of a page that you can play with.
