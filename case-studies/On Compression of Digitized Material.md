File Size. The files are significantly larger than a very high quality JPEG for most images. For example, a 2000 PPI scan of 35mm film results in a TIFF file that is approximately 16MB in size. For most images, the resulting high-quality, full-sized JPEG files are 4-8MB. For 4000 PPI scans, TIFF files are approximately 60MB; full-sized JPEG files are 10-15MB. These smaller files are much easier to use. They take less disk space for stoarge (and backup) and open much more quickly in any program making use of the images.
