- Broadcast to narrowcast - no longer a property of the medium.
* Using web archvies to preserve your project.
* Bitwiser II: ignored v redundant via MC.
* Ref from Bitwiser: Good practice and Quirks Mode

* Planning - top down worse than stakeholder engagement. CI versus an initio. Separate choices - strategy versus implementation. 
- Preservation Planning - Baysian versus frequentist... First principles/ab initio or Empirical modelling.
- Simplification pressure? e.g. Markdown or even Wikipedia? REST over SOAP. HTML over PDF? Others?
* Significant properties - content properties not relevant. Dependency analysis and critical characterisation role. For content, in future, eye of stakeholder means users should be able to express format preference.
* Format analysis - cf versions don't matter, features do.
* Modelling - oais is clumsy, arbitrary boundary, not user centered
* RI - best stuff done outside of the iPres community. Largely due to lack of resources, rather than goodwill or skills.
* Trust models omitted - trust is social.
* Trust http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_criticism
* Threat models uncertain?
* Pull in requirements and issues, AIT stuff.
* Pull in Monitrix, BDT, IMAQA, WAT Mining.

Obsolescence
------------
Given that is has proven possible to access the data, some might argue that the floppy disks and the data on them are not obsolete. I would say that this long, brittle chains of migration and extensive guesswork are exactly what obsolescence looks like. 

Even though a more efficient way to access the disks themselves is now available, the problem shifts understanding how to use the disks and the software, and how to access the data within.

It is the slow death of a thousand ambiguities, rather than an sudden, jarring expiration. Obsolescence is approached, rather than attained, with the costs of access rising every step of the way.



Data Mining Methodology
-----------------------
The emphasis on big data and statistical analysis in cultural and social contexts makes me uneasy. There is no 'noise' in humanities data sets. There are only silenced voices.
The direct adoption of big data/statistical methods makes me uneasy. There is no 'noise' in humanities data. There are only silenced voices.
