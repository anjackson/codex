    - That tacit v explicit thing.
    - How we learn 'blue' versus how we learn 'two'.
    - Nothing I can write here could mean you could learn to drive a car, just by reading. Or ride a bike. Or write a poem. Or debug a computer program. I could write things to try, things that might help, but I can't write words that finish the job. It's not 'the battle of Hastings was in 1066', it's not '', it's not quiz fodder.
    - Not about repetition of something complex. Such recitations can build skills that help you learn, but the precise execution alone is not it.

  - The Digital Difference:
    - Uncountable and countable sets
      - Describing reality versus language, packing infinities. 
      - That all digital limits this to finite sets.

      - Significant Properties
        - I think the tendency to keep it all comes from trying to avoid deciding what’s worth knowing. 
        - For me, critical DP issue is dependency analysis. From ‘what software do i need to access this’ aka format identification, to ‘what external resources are required’ like non-embedded fonts.

      - DPC post nicely shows the problem with abstracting representation information:

    - Goals: 
      - Common Carrier or Information Source
        - Seems to link to Shannon.
      - Outcome or Process.
  - Systems Of Care:
    - Tactics:
      - Workflows...
      - Fork v Line
      - Monitor v Engage
      - Format v Adaptive Response
      - Once v Forever / Product v Process / Preservation
      - Non-linear editing, Undo, versus mutation
      - Failure-driven design
    - Repository Architecture Patterns:
      - Start with known, experienced risks, outline possible solutions that can be baked into the architectural design 
      - Policy versus structure
      - Pipeline versus sidecar preservation
      - POINT: If your not generating your DIP from your actual AIP you’re not doing OAIS.
      - Use digitised images as example. Look at risks of the sidecar approach. 
      - Note pipeline approach is the same parts in a different shape.
      - Note user-driven processing is common and better handles transient failure, extension to edge cases etc.
    - One repo consequences http://ruthtillman.com/repository-ouroboros/
    - Architectures
      - Library doesnt care about digital
      - Patterns
      - Ingest then transform over heavy pre-ingest processing
      - Bridge the gap between OAIS and practice, starting with the overall information architectures and different ways of delivering the OAIS functions.
      - ARCH: Files in the middle 
      - ARCH: Federation
      - ARCH: Fixity/inventory??? patterns! BagIt, DB, DAMS/ ??? blockchain.
      - ARCH: Also Just-in-time gives you more chances to get it right. Just-in-case is often only done once and it’s harder to pick up problems. https://twitter.com/euanc/status/1223656274203742208
