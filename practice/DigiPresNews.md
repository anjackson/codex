Initially, I set the [@digipresnews][1] account so that it [use a socially aggregated news service to generate tweets of interest][2]. This worked well for a while, but mid-2012 the tweets became more and more irrelevant, and then dried up altogether.

So, I've now decided to try a new approach - to use it to bring together feeds from prominent digital preservation sites that do not already have a Twitter presence. The main focus is on community sites, but I've also included some of the more prominent blogs that do not current have a dedicated Twitter account.

The set-up is quite simple - each source is added as a feed to a dedicated [IFTTT][3], which constructs an appropriate tweet and tweets it.

We'll see how it goes, and shift the feeds around depending on any feedback.
