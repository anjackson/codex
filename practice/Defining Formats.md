Introduction
------------

The idea of 
[What is a file format?](http://qanda.digipres.org/38/what-is-a-file-format)

So, my broadest definition of a file format does like this:

> A format is a protocol designed to allow the persistence and transmission of the run-time state of computer software.

The only definition of format I've been able to come up with that seems to cover every example I can think of is this one:

> A format is a protocol that permits the state of computer software to be persisted and transmitted.



protocols

- Extensions
- First Bytes
- Content Type
- Specification
- Standardisation


- Single Software, Single Platform
- Multiple Software, Single Platform
- Multiple Software, Multiple Platforms
- Designing For The Future


That format survey, 20 years because these are the mature formats

Distinctions,

- created by (`xmp:CreatorTool` from the [Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) Schema](http://www.exiv2.org/tags-xmp-xmp.html), and also the `xmpMM:History` `softwareAgent` from the [XMP Media Management Schema](http://www.exiv2.org/tags-xmp-xmpMM.html))
- created for - formatted for target software
- created according to - formatted for a common specification


### Mixed Format Files ###

Despite their rather extreme nature, polyglots are not the most difficult to describe formats we might try to encompass with out format language.
HTML with JavaScript, etc.

Link to software feature dependency.


### Associating Software With Formats ###

We also want to formats that depend on software

PRONOM also contains [a list of software](http://apps.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/Software/proSoftwareSearch.aspx?status=listReport) and [associated vendors](http://apps.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/Vendor/proVendorSearch.aspx?status=listReport), but mapped in at the format level rather than the instance


### Combining extensions with first bytes ###

... that thing.


### Dialects ###

c.f. CSV, TIFF proprietary tags.


Are we really going to capture the history of a format. Look what's involved.
