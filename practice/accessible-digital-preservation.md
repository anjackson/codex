The idea that applying 'levels of preservation' to PREMIS itself might be helpful, in that we can make it easier to grasp by leaving the more abstract (and unnecessary) stuff till later.

Layered PREMIS
--------------

http://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/v2/premis-2-2.pdf

It seems that the Intellectual Object layer only really comes easy for digitisation of material with an accepted structure. It seems to go well for things that already have catalogue entries, but when you try to apply it to the web, you end up with rather meaningless prejudicial models that say more about how the metadata designers perceive the web that how it is actually used.

Just as there isn't always an existing intellectual infrastructure, digital preservation proceeds happily without an explicit respository system.

take out the Intellectual Object, and the Repository, but note that both can be layered back in later on, easily enough, as this is what already happens (permeability of repository etc.)

* BagIt or similar for the Objects.
* Spreadsheet or CHANGES.txt for the Events.
* LICENCE.txt for the rights.
* Bob@ginger.com for the Agents.
