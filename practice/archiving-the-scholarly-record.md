Something along the lines of...

computational science existed long before the web, and it worked.

hyperbole that we can't make progress without complete repeatabilty is not true. It's a potentially desirable optimisation.

Don't want broader discussions to get thrown off by this.

Social networking has also always played a strong role in the communication of scientific results. Just because it's now done more publically, via social media, just means it is now archivable, but does not necessarily indicate whether we should archive it.
