http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Shockwave
 .DCR (Director Compressed Resource) files created using the authoring tool Adobe Director.

http://helpx.adobe.com/director/kb/common-questions-director.html#main_export

Director files are saved with the DIR extension and can be opened and edited on either the Macintosh or Windows platform from within Director. In addition once a file or project has been completed it can be saved as a DXR which is a read-only, uneditable version of the DIR. Director projectors are executable versions of a Director file. Projectors include the Director runtime engine inside and therefore do not require installation of a plug-in. Projectors have the extension EXE on Windows. On Macintosh, projectors have no extension by default. A DCR is a Shockwave version of a DIR published via Director. Director casts can be saved as a regular Director cast, CST, a protected Director cast, CXT, or a Shockwave cast, CCT. In addition Director can export to digital video: MOV on Macintosh and AVI or MOV on Windows computers.

Windows and Mac, still supported.
I installed v12/64it and an example played fine, in Chrome.

RealAudio & RealMedia
---------------------
(ram/rm/ra)

And RealAudio (early versions) and RealMedia (later versions)
FFB = .ra%FD for early versions.
1801 .ra http://www.webarchive.org.uk/aadda-discovery/formats?f[0]=content_type_ext%3A%22.ra%22
audio/x-pn-realaudio; version=2.0 (1204)
application/vnd.rn-realmedia (268)
audio/x-pn-realaudio; version=1.0 (139)
124 .ra with audio/x-pn-realaudio; version=1.0
130 .ra with audio/x-pn-realaudio but no payload.
FFB .ra%FD (1343) .RMF (268) pnm: (39) rtsp (12)

For .rm: 
application/vnd.rn-realmedia (8094) Apply application/vnd.rn-realmedia filter
audio/x-pn-realaudio (6109)
FFB .RMF (8077), rtsp (6178)


For these, it seems ffmpeg can convert, so on the fly access is possible.

    $ ffmpeg -i roar.rm -f wav test.wav

Mining for Signatures
---------------------
Starting with unidentified formats: http://www.webarchive.org.uk/aadda-discovery/formats?f[0]=content_type%3A%22application/octet-stream%22, we can script a series of queries for different extensions that attempt to build plausible signatures for each, based on the FFB. 

application/octet-stream: 146,541
null: 351,779 almost all OLE2 with a few ZIP.

11109 .s5, with P%000010 or L%000010 as FFB
5302 .ipx, with very similar FFB, sb%xx01/2/6
4394 .nwc, all with '[Not' with a few '[NWZ' FFB (http://www.noteworthysoftware.com/player/)
3822 .dbf, with mostly 'OPLD' FFB and some other similar binary ones.
2482 .adx, with largely no FFB?

### Psion 5 ###
Starting at 'application/octet-stream' the most common unknown extension was .s5 - this had consistent magic (two FFB variants).

Parse Error Analysis
====================

Fuzzy Hash Analysis
===================

Need to show
* different content making the same hash?
* degree of change of a site over time, e.g. homepages.
* finding similar content across domains?

Works well for catching small changes in wales and york.  However, need to compare it with raw crypto hash of payload to see if the fuzzy has an advantage.

Case for the others is less clear, partially due to gaps in the record. Really need diffs/overlaps next to change graph.

Could also experiment with profiling location of edits to determine if changes are at top or bottom of the page.
