Note on Web Archiving
---------------------

* Introduction and basic processes.
    * Somewhat disconnected from process/user-simulation.
* Web Use and Web Studies
    * i.e. use cases for web archives
* Selection for Web Archives
    * Policy and process, would be good to compare pre/post LD and annotation model.
* Copying Websites
    * Some technical detail on server/translation/client archiving (c.f. process preservation.)
    * Somewhat disconnected, again.
* Access and Finding Aids
    * i.e. Discovery
* Mining Web Collection
    * i.e. more use cases
* Long-term preservation of web content.
    * Somewhat vague and OAIS focussed.
    * Very woolly on use of migration/emulation terms, and on how to integrate migrations.
    * No actual examples of obsolescence.
    * Note also that if you are not charged with access to a given resource, you may still be charged with it being discoverable, both via search and via linkage (in and out context).
* Large and small case studies with details.

Ideas
* Not at all user focussed beyond the use-cases.
* Does not make it clear that we are archiving a conversation, not resources. (may need to review to be sure, but the PANDAS->to->WARC story is not told AFAICT).
* Does not make it clear that the crawler is future user simulation.
* Separation of long and short term preservation is somewhat artificial - the current re-writing etc. is a preservation action. Lots happening already.
* A focus on annotation may help continuity of across the scales of selective to domain harvesting.
