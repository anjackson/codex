When making statements about the world, experimental evidence is how you raise mere consensus to something approaching truth.

when I doubt there's any consensus on the "Humanities".

Almost as much fun as all that malarky about defining "Digital Humanities".
Somehow with the implication that if you can't define it you shouldn't be taken seriously.

Outline
=======

* Two-fold challenges:
    * Indexing large collections
    * Suitable for analytics
* Indexing strategies:
    * Indexing into HDFS
    * Handling deduplication.
 * Preservation Features
    * Format and risk scanning included.
 * c.f. Sustainable Access writing.

Future work, timeline reconstruction. Missing 3xx, 4xx, 5xx, DNS FAIL, transient crawler errors, etc.

Curation's second death
=======================

[What Could Curation Possibly Mean?](http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2014/03/what-could-curation-possibly-mean/)

Curation has died before, on the web. Story of DMOZ and Google (and indeed Yahoo).

Spam problem.

But how do we know the algorithm is enough. Need humans to ensure value is reflected, and to try and address any gaps.

Curation is no longer absolute - no longer an attempt to tag and categorise into some universal ontology. Powered by social media constructs, curation now means a million tiny cliques of consensus. This may seem a backward step, but this loosely-coupled arrangement allows any real consensus to emerge at it's natural scale. EXAMPLES.

Rather like a folksonomy versus an ontology. All 'top down' ontologies requires consensus first, and although this might lead to a 'cleaner' data set, this also holds back adoption and growth and sets a high bar for communication and consensus-building. The 'bottom up' taxonomies like those on Flickr allow consensus to emerge more naturally, but also exposes conflict and inconsistency.

Some parallel to one-way web links versus two-way ones, which required consensus between two parties to be formed before a link could be established.

And so, where this consensus might apply to you, this allows search engines to augment their 'universal' full-text search and bring in results and rankings based on the value that others have implied through their acts of curation. It is not yet clear how well this will actually work in practice, but this seems to be the vision of the search engine giants.

As an aside, I suspect that this is why Google (among others) are so keen on authentic identities on the web. By trying to keep the social networks free of the false accounts that are the usual tool of spammers or trolls, they are attempting to prevent the arms race that has dogged them this far.

 is that the authentic opinions of individuals building things on the web will 


Data Mining Methodology
-----------------------
The emphasis on big data and statistical analysis in cultural and social contexts makes me uneasy. There is no 'noise' in humanities data sets. There are only silenced voices.
