title: Ideas For Preservation Tools & Services
---


A Safer Shell
-------------

Idea of forking a GitBash distribution (or similar) that is configured by default to be as safe as possible.

* [CmdUtils](http://www.maddogsw.com/cmdutils/) recycle command installed.
* rm aliased to interactive mode.
* Can the same be done for cp and mv when overwrites are about to happen?


Mapping Digital Preservation Space
----------------------------------

- Big migration matrix plot w no of tools
- Gap Analysis v services spine chart
- Identity tool fails
Start with format corpus
- Parse sig files too.
- Build a map.
- Create an analysis/map-maker application folder?
- Import foreg into it, setting up sync with PRONOM.
- Aim to make the Atlas instead of sync to Drupal.

Registry Game
-------------

- Social pressures plus...
- reward, competitions, achievements, progress tracking, challenges...
- Look at stack overflow and steal...
- Badges:
- {Format [Master} Minter]
- Tweaker (lots of small changes)
- Perfectionist (retweaking)
- Grammartron
- Regex Ninja or Magic Ninja
- Reviewer? Mentor? Teacher?
- Shotgun! Whoever is always there first, reviewing.
- Uploader, Test Data Provider
- Firestarter, first of an edit flurry
- Schema Schemer
- Addict. Most visits.
- Public timeline of achievement 
- Ranking etc


The Rosetta Corpus/Time Capsule
-------------------------------

The Bootstraps
-Enough to parse other docs, rather than every possible format.
-Includes multiple codes as well as specifications.
-ASCII, then more...
-Documents and images, types, multiple formats.
