What Do We Need

To go through

http://notepad.benfinoradin.info/2013/09/12/it-takes-a-village-to-save-a-hard-drive/

and other stories

And do consider what we truly need from our registries. What is achievable? What is helpful?

--
Now, go through and read it one more time, and think about how such a registry could actually have helped. What would it need to include?
--
Could it really replace the expertise of those five (or so) people? Or should its purpose be to capture and link what they have achieved?
--
Is the answer really in building registries? Or is it better to run more XFR STNs and help document and preserve what they do?

Could some research project, with some model knocked up to cover a vast problem space by some young researcher with very little experience actually doing digital preservation, ever, in any way, be expected to be sufficient expressive to cover this stuff?

Could any ontology or taxonomy ever be sophisticated enough to capture this process in a re-usable way? Even if that is possible, is the investment required to make it so even vagualy feasible?

And even if we could afford it, could we do it when we strip the heart out of it.

So, in that particular case, they need nothing. Their were people to ask. (loss sources, e.g. experience).

So, instead we can help preserve what they did. They started doing that anyway. We can do two things.  

1. Give it permanence.

2. Link it.

The latter is where the real added value might lie, linking it up, making it discoverable. How do we ensure anyone else who spots that port can find this story? How do we link these things.

This is just like authors and authority files. The purpose of which is not to stamp out ambiguity but to manage it. To collect aliases, and pick a preferred name, so that these stories can be brought together.

Who is actually doing digital preservation? And who of those is actually using or generating RepInfo as part of their job?

There is an issue about scope, and relation to other data stores, but I think you've jumped ahead too quickly. The problem is clearly stated: Make is possible to get the data out and re-use it. The solution will be whatever it takes to do that. Therefore, documentation, software and specification are liable to be in scope, but everything else will be driven by necessity. For me, the main attraction of this approach is that it will concentrate on whatever it takes to make it work, i.e. collect the data then model it flexibly. Not

Software

#JHOVE "approaching the end of its life": sourceforge.net/p/jhove/bugs/5â€¦ Makes me wonder about long-term implications for its user community?

Talking About Formats
---------------------
Note problem of limited PRONOM format language expressivity. .format.is versus expressions via mime type eg charset, encoding, codecs, versions

### Extended MIME Types

codecs
e.g. Quicktime VR example file = [ video/quicktime; codecs="cvid, pano" ]

Poor mans technology watch

* RI - best stuff done outside of the iPres community. Largely due to lack of resources, rather than goodwill or skills.

That Endangerment Survey
------------------------

Accidentally submitted for form early.
Didn't understand the language about 'the factor'.
'Information become inaccessible.'
Features versus formats.
Accompanying documentation did not make the 'factor' thing clear.

Formats and business needs thing
--------------------------------

* DROID need to know broken doc, not ???, similar with pdf and html etc.
