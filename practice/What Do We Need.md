What Do We Need

To go through

and other stories

And do consider what we truly need from our registries. What is achievable? What is helpful?

--
Now, go through and read it one more time, and think about how such a registry could actually have helped. What would it need to include?
--
Could it really replace the expertise of those five (or so) people? Or should its purpose be to capture and link what they have achieved?
--
Is the answer really in building registries? Or is it better to run more XFR STNs and help document and preserve what they do?
--

Could some research project, with some model knocked up to cover a vast problem space by some young researcher with very little experience actually doing digital preservation, ever, in any way, be expected to be sufficient expressive to cover this stuff?

Could any ontology or taxonomy ever be sophisticated enough to capture this process in a re-usable way? Even if that is possible, is the investment required to make it so even vagualy feasible?

---

So, in that particular case, they need nothing. Their were people to ask. (loss sources, e.g. experience).

So, instead we can help preserve what they did. They started doing that anyway. We can do two things.  

1. Give it permanence.

2. Link it.

The latter is where the real added value might lie, linking it up, making it discoverable. How do we ensure anyone else who spots that port can find this story? How do we link these things.

This is just like authors and authority files. The purpose of which is not to stamp out ambiguity but to manage it. To collect aliases, and pick a preferred name, so that these stories can be brought together.
