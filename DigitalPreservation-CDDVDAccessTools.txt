[CDex][1]  - [Open Source Digital Audio CD Extractor][2] 

[Cdparanoia][3]  extracts audio
from compact discs directly as data, with no
analog step between, and writes the data to a file or pipe in WAV,
AIFC, AIFC or raw 16 bit linear PC. Paranoia is a library that provides a unified, robust
interface for Linux applications that want to use CDROM devices. In addition to
Linux device interface unification, the library provides tools for
automatically identifying devices, and intelligent handling/correction of
errors at all levels of the interface. On top of a generic low-level packet
command layer, Paranoia implements high-level error-correcting interfaces for
tasks such as CDDA where broken or vastly non-standard devices are the rule,
rather than the exception.[][4] Â
