But\n    it is also the case that they can offer good value\n    for money. Adult Placement is an excellent example\n    of how small scale services can work. It has been\n    with us for many years, often without the recognition\n    it deserves \n\n  \"The practice guide sets out a comprehensive list\n    of practice points for commissioners to follow\n    and to share with their colleagues to help improve\n    adult placement schemes in their locality.\" \n\n  \tClick here to access Guide 14: Improving outcomes for service users\n    in adult placement: commissioning and care management.\n\n\n  Media contact\n\n  Annie Goss | Communications Officer | T: 020 7089\n    7117 | M:  07739 458 192 | Email: media@scie.org.uk\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n    \n        \n   \n   \t     \n    \n\t\t\n            accessibility |\n            access keys | \n            speech enabled | \n            help  |\n            terms and conditions |\n            ^top of the page\n        \n         \n\n\t\n\n    \n   \n    \n\n    \n    \n     \n    \t\n         \t\n            Charity No. 1092778, Company Reg.

Ychwanegodd Jocelyn Davies AC bod y penderfyniad am y Swyddfa Basbort yn creu rhagesiampl beryglus o gynlluniau’r llywodraeth Ceidwadwyr-Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol yng Nghymru a thynnodd sylw at y nifer uchel o swyddi eraill yng Nghymru allai gael eu torri er enghraifft y Swyddfa ar gyfer Ystadegau Cenedlaethol a’r Swyddfa Batentau sydd hefyd yng Nghasnewydd.\n\nDywedodd AC Plaid Cymru dros Ddwyrain De Cymru, Jocelyn Davies:\n\n“Roedd y newyddion am gynlluniau’r Ceidwadwyr-Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol I gau’r Swyddfa Basbort yng Nghasnewydd yn ergyd enfawr i’r gweithwyr ac i economi Cymru fel cyfanwaith. Mae angen i’r Ceidwadwyr-Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol yng Nghymru sefyll i fyny yn erbyn eu rheolwyr yn Llundain nawr a dweud wrthynt nad yw trin pobl a chymunedau Cymru yn y modd yma’n dderbyniol. Rwyf yn bryderus y gallai cau’r Swyddfa Basbort yng Nghasnewydd megis cychwyn yn unig. Mae cymaint o gyflogaeth yng Nghymru yn ddibynnol ar y sector gyhoeddus sydd yn cael ei reoli gan San Steffan. Yng Nghasnewydd yn unig mae miloedd yn cael eu cyflogi gan y Swyddfa ar gyfer Ystadegau Cenedlaethol a’r Swyddfa Batentau. Mae’n rhaid i ni yng Nghymru yrru neges glir i’r Ceidwadwyr-Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol yn Llundain na wnaiff Cymru gael ei drin yn y modd hwn.\n\nRydym yn rhy ymwybodol o’r hyn ddigwyddodd i swyddi yng Nghymru’r tro diwethaf roedd y Torïaid mewn llywodraeth ac rydym yn benderfynol i beidio gadael i hyn ddigwydd eto. Rydym yn gwybod o brofiad chwerw pan mae swyddi yn mynd, mae swyddi eraill yn dilyn gan fod cymaint o gwmnïoedd y sector breifat yn ddibynnol ar y cytundebau sydd ganddynt i gyflenwi’r sector gyhoeddus.\n\nErs dechrau’r argyfwng economaidd, mae Plaid Cymru mewn llywodraeth yma yng Nghymru wedi gweithio’n ddiflino i amddiffyn pobl a chymunedau Cymru. Rydym wedi gweithio gyda busnesau a gweithwyr i sicrhau bod y polisïau iawn mewn lle i helpu Cymru I oroesi’r storm economaidd. Rydym wedi datblygu cynlluniau i helpu pobl sydd dan fygythiad o golli eu swyddi neu i helpu pobl sydd mewn perygl o golli eu cartrefi. Er hynny os ydy’r Torïaid a’r Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol yn parhau gyda’r toriadau yma i’n sector cyhoeddus gallent osod ein heconomi yn ôl am genedlaethau, fel y digwyddodd dan y llywodraeth Dorïaidd y tro diwethaf.\n\nGellid dibynnu ar Plaid Cymru i sefyll i fyny dros anghenion pobl a chymunedau Cymru. Y prawf nawr bydd gweld os all y Ceidwadwyr a’r Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol sefyll i fyny yn erbyn eu rheolwyr yn Llundain a mynnu bod Swyddfa Basbort Casnewydd yn aros ar agor.”\nTudalen flaenorol  \n\n\n\n         \n\t\t\n\n        \n\n            \n   \t\nCyfrannu Nawri greu Cymru wellGwirfoddoliHelpa ni i ennillLledaena'r negesi dy ffrindiau ar y wePlaidByw.comDy luniau, trydar a fideos yn fyw!\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n                \n\n\t   \t\t\t\t\t\n\n   \t\n   \tDerbyn ebyst y Blaid\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are human leave this blank:\n\nEnw\n\n *\n\nEbost\n\n *\n\nDewis\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\n            \n\n            \n                \n  \n\n       \n\tGweledigaeth\t2011: Ein manifesto dros Gymru Well\n\tBusnes, yr economi a thrafnidiaeth  \n\tIechyd, gofal a gwasanaethau cymdeithasol \n\tPlant, Addysg a Phobl Ifanc\n\tEin Hiaith, Diwylliant a’n Treftadaeth\n\tYr amgylchedd, cefn gwlad ac adfywio\n\tTrosedd, cyfraith a threfn\n\tLlywodraeth Leol\n\tMaterion Rhyngwladol\n\tEin dyfodol cenedlaethol\n\tAntur Annibyniaeth\n\n\n\n\n\tPwy ydym ni\tSenedd: ACau\n\tCynghorwyr\n\tSan Steffan: ASau\n\tEin Hanes\n\tSan Steffan: Arglwyddi\n\tCyswllt\n\tEwrop: ASE\n\n\n\n\n\tCymryd rhan\tCyfrannu \n\tAelodaeth \n\tPleidiol wyf!\n\tFy mhoster Plaid\n\tClwb y Llywydd \n\tPasiwch hi 'mlaen\n\tTaflennu i ennill\n\tSwyddi gwag\n\tcymdeithasu\n\tCyfrannu fy nghreadigrwydd\n\tPecyn Logos a brandio\n\tAdran Aelodau\n\n\n\n\n\tGrwpiau'r Blaid \tGwyrddion dros y Blaid\n\tCymruX - Plaid Ifanc\n\tPlaid Pride\n\tCristnogion dros y Blaid \n\tUndeb\n\tMwslimiaid dros y Blaid\n\tPlaid ar draws y Byd\n\tDolennau\n\tSaeson dros y Blaid\n\n\n\n\tNewyddion a Digwyddiadau\tNewyddion\n\tDigwyddiadau\n\tBlog y Llechen\n\n\n\n\n                     \n\n                \n\n            \t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tPolisi preifatrwydd | \nHyrwyddwyd  gan Gwenllian Lansdown, Ty Gwynfor, Llys Anson, Glanfa’r Iwerydd, Caerdydd | \n\t\t\t\t\n\n                    \n\n                \tHawlfraint Plaid Cymru.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDarparir a datblygwyd y safle gan Spindogs\n\n\n                \n\n            \n            \n\n            \n\t    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The bulk of the information \n      contained within the World Database on Protected Areas has been obtained \n      from these agencies. \n       Historically data has been collected through requests (every 4-5 years) \n        for data updates from national agencies in preparation for the production \n        of the UN List of Protected Areas. \n\n       UNEP-WCMC is also developing one-to-one agreements with national agencies \n        to ensure the provisions and availability of up-to-date data.. For example, \n        in 2003 an agreement was signed with the Russian Protected Areas Laboratory \n        to cover Russian protected areas, which number in excess of 11,000 sites \n        and cover more than 1.5 million km around 8% of the world's total protected \n        areas. \n\n      \n        In the interests of improving the WDPA UNEP-WCMC is also working with \n        a wide range of partners, many of whom work with government agencies at \n        the national level, on an ongoing basis. \n\n       On a regional basis UNEP-WCMC also works with inter-governmental partners \n        in the provision of protected area information. The most longstanding \n        collaboration is with the European \n        Environment Agency (EEA) who have responsibility for the European \n        countries. The European data is available through the Common \n        Database on Designated Areas (CDDA). EEA has appointed the European \n        Topic Centre on Nature Protection and Biodiversity (ETC/NPB) to manage \n        the database and liaise with national focal points. The national European \n        data is then transfered by the ETC/NPB from the CDDA to the WDPA maintained \n        by UNEP-WCMC, which also provides information to the CDDA on international \n        sites. In Southeast Asia UNEP-WCMC collaborates with the ASEAN \n        Regional Centre for Biodiversity Conservation (ARCBC) in obtaining \n        protected area information for that region.\n\n      \n\n      \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t�� UNEP-WCMC | FAQs | Contact Us | Site Map \n\t\n\n\t\n\t \n\t \n    \n\n\n\n",

It is not specifically CP but there are many parents there who have children with CP.  It is very busy forum and not pre-moderated.  It is a fantatic forum where everyone can ask questions, vent, rant and celebrate.  Hope this helps and hope to see you there.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSelect rating\nPoor\nOkay\nGood\nGreat\nAwesome\n\n\n Your rating: None\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLogin or register to post comments\n\tReport\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n  \n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n \n    \n       mafala \n\n\n      \n              \n\n      \n      \n        \n        Offline\n      \n\n\n            \n      \n          \n\n\n    \n              \n          Joined: 26/03/2010        \n\n      \n      \n      \n              \n          Groups: None        \n\n          \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n              \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n            \n          \n\n  \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPosted on 29 June 2006\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t#4 \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHi Charley\n\nI think there is one called www.specialkidsintheUK.org. It's for parents who have children with SN, not just CP. I joined it a few months after my son came home from hospital when I was still feeling very raw and was trying to deal with the situation as best I could. It was great at first, then I felt victim of the 'schoolyard bullies' on the forum who seemingly had nothing better to do than post on the forum while the kids were at school. It turned in to a horrible experience and I was left feeling worse than when I joined. Having a moderated forum is a pain at times, but an unmoderated one can be quite dangerous for your mental health, I think. \n\nI think that SKinUK has improved since then and has become much more sorted than when I first joined. It's not a place I want to go back to though because it's just going to bring back some very nasty memories. On hindsight it was probably nothing, but I was very vulnerable at the time. However, I did make a couple of friends there. Try it at your own peril, I say. I've seen positive comments on here about it, so it can't be that bad.\n\nI feel very inhibited by this particular forum because I know that professionals 'snoop' and I don't really like them to know what I'm feeling. I was particularly annoyed by a CE conductor coming on this forum to defend CE. I think whether a particular treatment has worked or not is a discussion that should be between parents.  \n\nIf you want a discussion forum just for parents with children who have CP, you can set one up in 5 minuttes on google or yahoo. I'm busy getting ready for exams and  should be studying than posting on this forum! I need the distraction though.  \n\nIf you do set your own group up let us know.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSelect rating\nPoor\nOkay\nGood\nGreat\nAwesome\n\n\n Your rating: None\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLogin or register to post comments\n\tReport\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n  \n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n \n    \n       brighteyes \n\n\n      \n              \n\n      \n      \n        \n        Offline\n      \n\n\n            \n      \n          \n\n\n    \n              \n          Joined: 25/03/2010        \n\n      \n      \n      \n              \n          Groups: None        \n\n          \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n              \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n            \n          \n\n  \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPosted on 29 June 2006\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t#5 \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHi\n\nThere are quite a few of us using \"special kids in the uk\".

I did try, and think I ended up slightly upsetting or annoying a couple of people. It's because in the early days of having a child with cp, you (well me certainly) just don't know what the hell's going on and have this incredible instinct/desire to compare your kids and share experiences/fears etc with others with a similar diagnosis, (lordy knows there's enough of us in the UK to compare notes with!) which may or may not include (for example) medical negligence or mental disability issues. I mean, there are issues that are specifically pertinent to cp, as there are for any diagnosis of course, and that's why I feel I need to be able to access a better specific CP forum.\n\nLooks like there isn't one though in the uk [sad], but thank you for all the suggestions, (I'll have a look) I just don't have time to set up one myself and I don't like the format of the yahoo/google groups thingies anyway. I know it would be even less popular than this one too lol - it would be better for it to be easily found on the net. Scope for instance would be a great host (!)\n\nI know what you mean Mafala about feeling snooped upon by professionals when it comes to trying to share some feelings, but some of the feelings I've had I wouldn't post ANYWHERE  on the web. But on the other hand, it's great to sometimes have professional input. IF this were a more popular forum, a healthy and interesting debate could ensue from a professional's perhaps biased opinion such as that CE conductor. I'm sorry to hear you had a horrid exp on SK when you were feeling so terrible and vulnerable yourself. \nGood luck with your exams!  x\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSelect rating\nPoor\nOkay\nGood\nGreat\nAwesome\n\n\n Your rating: None\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLogin or register to post comments\n\tReport\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n  \n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n \n    \n       debbie \n\n\n      \n              \n\n      \n      \n        \n        Offline\n      \n\n\n            \n      \n          \n\n\n    \n              \n          Joined: 24/03/2010        \n\n      \n      \n      \n              \n          Groups: None        \n\n          \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n              \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n            \n          \n\n  \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPosted on 30 June 2006\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t#8 \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHi\n\ni regularly have a look on Special kids in uk but i feel most of the posts are by people who seem to know each other well and post a lot so it can be a bit intimidating - its almost as if you are snooping on other peoples conversations.\n\nThis forum used to be much better when it wasn't moderated but i would rather post here that on special kids even with the moderation.

At the  time I had an 8 month old with a severe brain injury who needed 24 hour care. I didn't have time to look at 200 daily posts, let alone respond to them all. The forum owner wanted to change the format of the  forum. When I suggested to her how she could reorganise the forum so no felt ignored and  you didn't have to read 200 emails a day - all hell broke lose. I was even threatened with a voodoo doll (as if I didn't feel cursed already!). I saw that the forum was changed since from what it was, so somehow someone managed to get through to the neophobes. I don't even know why I'm telling this, I'm obviously still angry about it...\n\nThe internet is great, but it can also be a bad place because you're not talking to people face to face and a lot of the conventional social rules don't apply or new ones are required that are difficult to gauge.\n\nMy mother ran a massive support group for breast cancer for over 5 years, but she stopped and handed it over to someone else. It burned her out at the end. It started great, then some of the women with mild cancer didn't want to share the forum with the ones who were terminal because they found it too upsetting. The ones who were terminal felt rejected, but really needed to share their experience with others. It was like a can of worms. Her forum became the subject for an anthropologist who followed it for many years and  eventually did her ph.d based on it. \n\nStarting a new forum is a little bit like opening a can of worms, but like some of you I do feel totally unsupported by friends and family. They don't get it and if I occassionally have a bad day I just get told to get over it.

Im Sandy one of 5 moderators of the SpecialKidsInThe UK forum. \nI thought I should just post and let you all know that infact special kids forum IS moderated and although it is not PRE moderated any offensive posts are removed very very quickly. The moderators dedicate alot of time to reading ALL the great number of posts. \n\nIn response to some of the comments here I can only apologise if anything was missed by the moderators. In the case of Mfala, I have read nothing that could be miscontrued as bullying on the public forum and I would stress that if anything like this was to happen on the special kids forum that there are 5 moderators who can be very easily contacted and would have certainly removed any offensive posts at your request. \n\nAs you can imagine with over 480 members it can be very difficult to read and empathise with every emotion. \nI have been unable to locate your details on our database.So im wondering if perhaps you were a member of the Yahoo group called specialkidsintheuk ? Which has now ceased to exist and members moved to the new forum on the charity website ( over 18 months old now!!) There has always been the option not to recieve posts my email and infact nowadays the email facility has been switched off. Some 58000 emails in the last 12 months would be quite difficult for anyone to keep up with! \nYou are most welcome to post again so please feel free to join us. \n\nTo Charley and others , we do have a large number of regular posters who know each other quite well as they have been posting on the same internet forums for up to 6 years in some cases. Some very good friendships have been formed and these friendships have helped us to build a good basis for our *meets* which give families old and new a chance to meet one another face to face. I can understand how this can make you feel like your listening in on other private conversations but they are all aware that it is a public forum and we have noticed that they are also the people who regularly post to each and every welcome message when a new member joins. Each individually welcoming you to the forum to share in thier experiences. Please dont read too much into the fact that some people are able to post more than others you are ALL very very welcome.\nI absolutely assure you your recent posts did not offend or upset anyone, sometimes a post can provoke thoughts on similar or other things from any member and we encourage people to post openly but considerately if that is the case. \n\nAt special kids we often refer members to the scope forum and to other more diagnosis specific forums. We obviously cannot have ALL that EVERYONE needs but on the whole I think we are doing a pretty good job . today we have over 480 members and very very few complaints about the forum.  All complaints and comments are taken seriously so please do give your feedback to the moderators. \n\nI hope this helps and look forward to hearing from you.\n\nSandy \n\ntrustee and moderator Special kids in The Uk \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSelect rating\nPoor\nOkay\nGood\nGreat\nAwesome\n\n\n Your rating: None\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLogin or register to post comments\n\tReport\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n  \n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n \n    \n       mafala \n\n\n      \n              \n\n      \n      \n        \n        Offline\n      \n\n\n            \n      \n          \n\n\n    \n              \n          Joined: 26/03/2010        \n\n      \n      \n      \n              \n          Groups: None        \n\n          \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n              \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n            \n          \n\n  \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPosted on 3 July 2006\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t#12 \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHi Sandy\n\nMy experience dates back 3 years, so it was when the forum was a yahoo group and difficult to moderate. . I'm glad to hear that special kids in now an organised and moderated forum with the capacity (and will) to clamp down on the type of behaviour that I was subjected to back then.  The irony is that all I did was to suggest changing the forum to a similar format to what it is now (I used to manage content for a big website before I had my son). It just didn't go down well with the 'inner circled' of forum members.

I do post occasionally and do read some very useful info here but it does feel very \"controlled\".\n\nI am also on Special Kids and whist I read it regularly I don't post that often and I know what you mean about it seeming like a big group who all know each other.  However, I also feel it is extremely welcoming and inclusive and personally I have never felt left out - and I certainly don't post welcomes to every new member etc (though I must admit I was very touched when I joined and I got loads of welcomes)\nIt is a great place to go and vent steam - no judgement just understanding (at least that has been my experience since I joined in Dec or January last)\n\nSounds like Mafala was very unfortunate and I know that my husband used to be on the Yahoo group and gave up in the end as there was far too much post, with a lot of off-topic stuff mixed in.  Now it is much easier to read the threads you want to and mostly people mark off-topic as such.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSelect rating\nPoor\nOkay\nGood\nGreat\nAwesome\n\n\n Your rating: None\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLogin or register to post comments\n\tReport\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n  \n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n \n    \n       panther \n\n\n      \n              \n\n      \n      \n        \n        Offline\n      \n\n\n            \n      \n          \n\n\n    \n              \n          Joined: 26/03/2010        \n\n      \n      \n      \n              \n          Groups: None        \n\n          \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n              \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n            \n          \n\n  \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPosted on 3 July 2006\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t#14 \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI have been reading the responses on this topic and agree that npw this forum is pre moderated it is not as good.\n\nI'm an adult with cp and as someone has already said there are times you would like a quicker response which you used to get before this forum changed. i've noticed recently that there are times posts are taking over 24 hours to go live and are often then moderated in some way.\n\nI just wondered if Scope plan to make any changes to forum bearing in mind the coments in this topic and the number of people who have said they are no longer happy with this forum but still post as there is nowhere else to go.\n\nOr are we just wasting our time with even voicing our views to Scope as there appears to of been very little response from Scope on this topic and only 2 replies from Scope in the talk to Scope section about why the forum needs to be pre moderated.\n\nHelen\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSelect rating\nPoor\nOkay\nGood\nGreat\nAwesome\n\n\n Your rating: None\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLogin or register to post comments\n\tReport\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n  \n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n \n    \n       charley \n\n\n      \n              \n\n      \n      \n        \n        Offline\n      \n\n\n            \n      \n          \n\n\n    \n              \n          Joined: 24/03/2010        \n\n      \n      \n      \n              \n          Groups: None        \n\n          \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n              \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n            \n          \n\n  \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPosted on 3 July 2006\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t#15 \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHi Sandy, blimey your post got posted quickly [shock] lol! Thank you for taking the time to post here.\n\nI've been posting on SK lately and been having a look around and have to say I think it's a really great and necessary national resource and the committee members obviously work very hard.  I can't believe there's only 480 members (though I've noticed a few new members from the Scope board joining in the last few days lol).  \n\nOn a personal note, I'm glad to hear my posts haven't upset anyone.  I'm still a novice at all this stuff and feel like a bit of a scribble emotionally some of the time. I now know what it's like to feel destroyed and know how hard it is somedays to stay strong, so I'm ultra aware of causing anyone any additional iota of distress by saying anything that I might inadvertently and naively post.  That's why I think it's such a shame this \"Early Years\" board is so inadequate, it should be somewhere where newbies can indulge in being a mess and help each other get sorted out, and where people further down the line can advise.\n\nMafala that sounds truly horrible, a voodoo doll ffs!!  I'm not surprised you're still feeling raw. I'd love to see you over there though, I find your posts extremely well informed and very helpful.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSelect rating\nPoor\nOkay\nGood\nGreat\nAwesome\n\n\n Your rating: None\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLogin or register to post comments\n\tReport\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n  \n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n \n    \n       mafala \n\n\n      \n              \n\n      \n      \n        \n        Offline\n      \n\n\n            \n      \n          \n\n\n    \n              \n          Joined: 26/03/2010        \n\n      \n      \n      \n              \n          Groups: None        \n\n          \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n              \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n            \n          \n\n  \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPosted on 3 July 2006\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t#16 \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHi Charley\n\nThat's very kind of you to say. I'm glad I can be of help. I wish I felt more able to rant and rave myself (believe me I do!), but over the years I've become far too self-conscious about upsetting people, particularly those parents who perceive they have a worse deal with their kids than I do. I know what you mean about the danger of posting something that is inadvertedly naive and then upsetting someone. It's a no-win situation. On the one hand you're trying to stay optimistic  while everything is still new, on the other hand you want to get more information and you want to share your feelings. You have to be thicked-skinned  too (and who is?)\n\nI think that Scope should not pre-moderate, but keep an eye on postings and take them down as soon as any offensive postings appear. It's not possible to keep a lively community by only publishing postings once in a while. At the weekends when most people have time to post, no post is published because the moderator is obviously having  the weekend off. Scope should make life easier for themselves and allow us to post and keep and eye on the forum taking any offensive material down, as and when they appear. It might also be an idea to change the registration system, so it's only people with genuine interest that can register.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSelect rating\nPoor\nOkay\nGood\nGreat\nAwesome\n\n\n Your rating: None\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLogin or register to post comments\n\tReport\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n  \n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n \n    \n       charley \n\n\n      \n              \n\n      \n      \n        \n        Offline\n      \n\n\n            \n      \n          \n\n\n    \n              \n          Joined: 24/03/2010        \n\n      \n      \n      \n              \n          Groups: None        \n\n          \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n              \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n            \n          \n\n  \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPosted on 3 July 2006\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t#17 \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI'm having such a bad day today, I'm so worried about my little boy, I haven't got anyone to talk to anyone at all about it apart from on forums. I've been sobbing and wringing my hands I feel sick and like I'm going insane with fear.  I hardly ever cry. I phoned Scope. They couldn't really help with my particular worry today. I'm on my own for months while my partner is working away. I NEED a forum that's not pre-moderated.\n\nThere you go, a bit of honesty. Selfish and pathetic but true. We've all been there and sometimes we still go there.\n\nHow can we get Scope to stop pre-moderating?\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSelect rating\nPoor\nOkay\nGood\nGreat\nAwesome\n\n\n Your rating: None\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLogin or register to post comments\n\tReport\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n  \n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n \n    \n       charley \n\n\n      \n              \n\n      \n      \n        \n        Offline\n      \n\n\n            \n      \n          \n\n\n    \n              \n          Joined: 24/03/2010        \n\n      \n      \n      \n              \n          Groups: None        \n\n          \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n              \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n            \n          \n\n  \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPosted on 3 July 2006\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t#18 \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand I've been like this all weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSelect rating\nPoor\nOkay\nGood\nGreat\nAwesome\n\n\n Your rating: None\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLogin or register to post comments\n\tReport\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n  \n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n \n    \n       wenders \n\n\n      \n              \n\n      \n      \n        \n        Offline\n      \n\n\n            \n      \n          \n\n\n    \n              \n          Joined: 26/03/2010        \n\n      \n      \n      \n              \n          Groups: None        \n\n          \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n              \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n            \n          \n\n  \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPosted on 4 July 2006\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t#19 \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI totally agree that this forum should be moderated...and not PRE - moderated..... there are enough of us that would volunteer to help out on the sites...

Staff work until 9pm weekdays and also at weekends, and incoming postings are checked regularly. We therefore aim to have your messages posted as soon as possible and certainly within 24 hours.\n\nIf a delay occurs it may be for the following reasons:-\n•\tUnforeseen staff shortages over a weekend.\n•\tIf a posting requires further research or a response from another part of Scope, in which case we aim to have your message and the response posted within 48 hours. However, occasionally this may take longer.\n•\tIT problems, which prevents access to emails or forum postings.\n\nWith regard to moderation.  We would point out that this section of the website is intended as a discussion forum and not a chatroom.  \n\nThe forum has been and is still used by children and vulnerable adults.  For this reason we took the decision that the site should be pre-moderated. This was a considered decision made after taking advice from child/adult protection advisors and legal experts.

I'm sure Scope can keep people safe online with out slowing this forum down to snail pace.\n\nI think what the bottom line really is is that Scope decided to pre moderate this forum not realising just how nuch work and time it takes as it is a fairly busy forum. Therefore they have not allowed for the number of staff needed to keep it going at a reasonable level of response and going live times. It was believed that staff on the helpline could do both jobs of manning the helpline and pre moderating this forum. Maybe Scope need to re think the best way to keep this forum running so people do feel supported. As we don't feel supported at the moment.\n\nHelen\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSelect rating\nPoor\nOkay\nGood\nGreat\nAwesome\n\n\n Your rating: None\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLogin or register to post comments\n\tReport\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n  \n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n \n    \n       swift \n\n\n      \n              \n\n      \n      \n        \n        Offline\n      \n\n\n            \n      \n          \n\n\n    \n              \n          Joined: 24/03/2010        \n\n      \n      \n      \n              \n          Groups: None        \n\n          \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n              \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n            \n          \n\n  \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPosted on 6 July 2006\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t#27 \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFollowing on from what mafala said re: professionals, I find myself in a difficult position on several forums.\n\nI've got generalised dystonia (as opposed to CP, but obviously there are overlaps between dystonia and dystonic CP)...but I'm also studying to be a healthcare professional.  It makes life very difficult sometimes, when in a way I think it just gives me wider different perspectives on my/other peoples' issues.  One forum I had to stop posting on, simply because of the way people were acting about a certain group of professionals (and how they acted when they found out I was training to be one).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSelect rating\nPoor\nOkay\nGood\nGreat\nAwesome\n\n\n Your rating: None\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLogin or register to post comments\n\tReport\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n  \n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n \n    \n       charley \n\n\n      \n              \n\n      \n      \n        \n        Offline\n      \n\n\n            \n      \n          \n\n\n    \n              \n          Joined: 24/03/2010        \n\n      \n      \n      \n              \n          Groups: None        \n\n          \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n              \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n            \n          \n\n  \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPosted on 6 July 2006\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t#28 \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHi Scope\n\nThanks for posting again. I understand your staff do their best to keep up with the premoderation inbetween other stuff, but honestly, it often takes a whole day and more to see a post.  How can you have a proper discussion over such a protracted and disjointed timeframe?  As for you not wanting it to be a \"chatroom\", that kind of feels slightly patronising/schoolteachery.  I'm not sure any of the subjects we want to discuss here are very \"chatty\". \n\nI hate to complain, but, it's only because I'm bothered because I like the posters and I feel comfortable here.  Have you considered asking any of us users to help moderate?  I'm sure you can see that some of us could be a potentially very useful resource. \n\nCan you add this subject to your next committee meeting agenda please?\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSelect rating\nPoor\nOkay\nGood\nGreat\nAwesome\n\n\n Your rating: None\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLogin or register to post comments\n\tReport\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n  \n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n \n    \n       scope forum pre... \n\n\n      \n              \n\n      \n      \n        \n        Offline\n      \n\n\n            \n      \n          \n\n\n    \n              \n          Joined: 25/03/2010        \n\n      \n      \n      \n              \n          Groups: None        \n\n          \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n              \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n            \n          \n\n  \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPosted on 7 July 2006\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t#29 \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Charley et al,\n\nThank you for your comments.\n\nI can only repeat that the issue of premoderation was considered very carefully before a decision was made and I would refer to the reasons given in an earlier posting.\n\nHowever, we are very concerned at the number of comments from people saying it often takes over 12 or 24 hours for their messages to be posted.  \n\nWe appreciate there is a problem with the times shown on the forum – the clock is clearly wrong and we will ask Webmaster to look into this but I can assure everyone that we regularly check the forum a minimum of 4 times a day during the week and at least twice a day at weekends. In addition to regular checks throughout the day, the forum is always the first and last job of the day as it is our intention that no un-necessary delays occur and the vast majority of messages are posted within a couple of hours of recipt.\n\nAs explained, the only reason for any delay is if we have to edit a message (which would include taking out personal details, any advertising or anything offensive or libellous) or if we need to compose or seek a response from someone with more expertise.  We try to do this within our standards of 48 hours but occasionally it may take longer. \n\nIf you or any parents are having a bad day, the Scope Helpline and Fieldworkers are here to offer support and information.  Please also remember that Scope has parent befriending schemes and local groups which may offer a venue for you to talk to other parents, share experiences and support each other.  Your Scope Fieldworker or Community Team will be able to tell you about services in your area. If you are unsure as to where your local team is, please contact the Helpline.\n\nKind\nRegards\n\nFroum Premoderator\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSelect rating\nPoor\nOkay\nGood\nGreat\nAwesome\n\n\n Your rating: None\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLogin or register to post comments\n\tReport\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n  \n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n \n    \n       mafala \n\n\n      \n              \n\n      \n      \n        \n        Offline\n      \n\n\n            \n      \n          \n\n\n    \n              \n          Joined: 26/03/2010        \n\n      \n      \n      \n              \n          Groups: None        \n\n          \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n              \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n            \n          \n\n  \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPosted on 7 July 2006\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t#30 \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSwift, I'm also training to be a health care professional and I think there are quite a few health care professionals among people posting here.

I could never dream of letting my true feelings known to somebody involved with my son's welfare, because I learned early on that polite, pursuasiveness gets you more results. \n\nPlease don't feel you can't post because of my comments.

Many Assembly members already have blogs and it is likely that this number will grow after the election.\n\nCiaran Jenkins on Blamerbell Briefs comments on the increasing use of Facebook by those who seek to serve and hints that perhaps we should act our age. His taunting rather reflects Glyn Davies' bewilderment at finding himself a member of this social network.\n\nCiaran tells us that 'Facebook is for writing crap banter on your mates' walls. It's for stalking attractive women in American colleges. And it's for posting embarrassing photos of drunken misdemeanours.' It seems that it is also now for politicians like Peter Hain, Sir Menzies Campbell and many others to reach out to a younger generation in an effort to get their message across.\n\nWhilst they are there I don't feel too much like a fish out of water. Contrary to Ciaran's allegation of fakery, the interests I list on my facebook page are genuine and very much reflect the fact that I am a forty plus, aging rocker who just happens to like quirky science fiction programmes.\n\nAs politicians expand their usage of the interweb the more their activities will come to the attention of the Parliamentary authorities and so it has come to pass. When Assembly Members reconvene after the elections one of the many things they will be asked to vote on is a new protocol on how they should behave on-line. The Assembly authorities have decided that they want a piece of the action. They want to regulate what we can blog on and how our sites look. It will make for a very interesting debate.\n\n          # posted by Peter Black : 7:33 AM\n          \n\n\t\t\n\n \n  \n\t\n\t\t\tComments:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tOn Facebook you have to join a group to receive messages from that group, so I really don't see what young Jenkins is going on about. And I don't see why politicians should be excluded from \"crap banter\". They practically invented it!\n;-)\n\n\t\t\t\t# posted by  sanddef : 9:34 AM\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tThere is a difference between the professional and the personal. That is the key distinction.\n\nFacebook is an social networking tool where people (usually real friends) let their virtual hair down. Groups are created with irony, not with serious intent. Banter is prevalent. There is no goal, it's just about an online exploration of what are usually friendships rooted at some stage in genuine face-to-face social interaction.\n\nThe new political element of Facebook ignores the frank personal honesty which has till now been taken for granted. The jokes you are not allowed to make, the innuendo and what time did *you* get in this morning? By their very nature, politicians want to avoid this sort of honesty. \n\nInstead, it's a 'vote for me and I'll tell you what my favourite bands are' sort of trade-off that we've been seeing in the mainstream press for quite some time.\n\n\t\t\t\t# posted by  Blamerbell : 10:45 AM\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tI just don't really get the whole 'politicians on facebook' thing - actually, I don't get the whole 'adults on facebook' thing - this stuff is for 14 year old boys in bands or maybe students with too much free time - if you're a grown-up, just pick up the phone and talk to people you want to talk to!\n\n\t\t\t\t# posted by  Lexy : 9:24 AM\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tPost a Comment\n\t\n        \n \n\n        \n\n\t\n \n\n\t<< Home\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nBest for Wales; Best for Britain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  \n\n\n                  \n                 \n                  \n                  \n                  What they are saying about this blog and its author\n\n\t\t\n\n                  \n                  The longest running blog by an elected Liberal Democrat politician \n                  \n\n                  \n\n                  \"The Liberal Democrat AM's site is fast-achieving cult status as surfers check out the latest musings on his personal web log.\" \n                  \nRichard Hazlewood, South Wales Echo\n                  \n \n                  \n                 \n                  \"highly readable and, in part, quite entertaining....the website is certainly worth a visit\" \n                  \n Brian Walters, South Wales Evening Post\n                  \n                  \n                  \n\n                  \"a double espresso of dull.

Travel abroad will be impossible if the person has been to the same country under the previous identity (presuming the other country retains a biometric record.)  (See SpyBlog?s extensive writing on this).\n\nWhatever you feel about the specific case of Maxine Carr, there are numerous people who will require a change of identity in their lives ? witnesses to serious crimes, undercover agents, people fleeing persecution ? the list is probably longer than you initially think.\n\nAnother issue raised is that for a new indentity to be maintained within the UK there must be an official mechanism to erase past identities.  Where there is an official mechanism there is a greater liklihood that unnofficial erasures will also take place.  The greatest threats that identity cards are supposedly going to protect us from will be the same ones that take advantage of these mechanisms.  This being the case we are left with an identity register we can?t really trust, as well as people running it we can?t trust.\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis entry was posted\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\tby WP Admin on Thursday, February 24th, 2005 at 16:47\t\t\t\t\t\tand is filed under Neutral,  UK News Articles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoth comments and pings are currently closed.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n  \t\t\n\t\tComments are closed.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t  \n\t\tID in the News\t\tis powered by WordPress \n\n\t\tEntries (RSS) and Comments (RSS).\n\t\t \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t \n  \tHome\n\tAbout 'ID cards' \n\t  \tThe case against\n\tFAQ\n\tThe database state\n\tOpinion Polls\n\tFurther reading \n\n\n\t\n\tAbout NO2ID \n\t  \tContact details\n\tNO2ID supporters\n\tPublic figures vs. ID\n\n\n\t\n\tLocal groups\n\tOverseas\n\tGet involved\n\t  \tRegister support\n\tBecome a member\n\tDonate\n\tNO2ID shop\n\tOffer your help\n\tLink to us\n\tOther things to do\n\n\n\t\n\tPress & Media \n\t  \tNewsBlog\n\tEvents diary\n\tNewsletters\n\tPress releases\n\tCartoon gallery\n\n\n\t\n\tResources\n\t  \tAudio collection\n\tGraphical materials\n\tVideos and Images\n\tOfficial motions\n\n\n\t\n\tDiscussion forum\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSearch: \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\tSearch provided by Google\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch new feature-length documentary 'Erasing David'\n   \n\n\n   \n\n\t\n\n   NO2ID movies...\n\n\n\nPet Shop Boys\n\n   'Integral' microsite\n\n\n\n\n\n\tDonate\n\n        \n\t\tDonate online or by credit card\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\nor buy merchandise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\tCategories\n\n\t\t\t(In)security (370)\n\n\tAnti (558)\n\n\tBiometrics (176)\n\n\tDatabase state (300)\n\n\tForeign Articles (58)\n\n\tGeneral (1038)\n\n\tNeutral (734)\n\n\tPro (55)\n\n\tUK News Articles (1367)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t    February 2005\tM\tT\tW\tT\tF\tS\tS\n\t� Jan\t�\tMar �\n\t�\t1\t2\t3\t4\t5\t6\n\t7\t8\t9\t10\t11\t12\t13\n\t14\t15\t16\t17\t18\t19\t20\n\t21\t22\t23\t24\t25\t26\t27\n\t28\t�\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t    Archives\n\n\t    \tArchives:\n\t    \t\n\t\t    By Month\n January 2011 \n December 2010 \n November 2010 \n October 2010 \n September 2010 \n August 2010 \n July 2010 \n June 2010 \n May 2010 \n April 2010 \n March 2010 \n February 2010 \n January 2010 \n December 2009 \n November 2009 \n October 2009 \n September 2009 \n August 2009 \n July 2009 \n June 2009 \n May 2009 \n April 2009 \n March 2009 \n February 2009 \n January 2009 \n December 2008 \n November 2008 \n October 2008 \n September 2008 \n August 2008 \n July 2008 \n June 2008 \n May 2008 \n April 2008 \n March 2008 \n February 2008 \n January 2008 \n December 2007 \n November 2007 \n October 2007 \n September 2007 \n August 2007 \n July 2007 \n June 2007 \n May 2007 \n April 2007 \n March 2007 \n February 2007 \n January 2007 \n December 2006 \n November 2006 \n October 2006 \n September 2006 \n August 2006 \n July 2006 \n June 2006 \n May 2006 \n April 2006 \n March 2006 \n February 2006 \n January 2006 \n December 2005 \n November 2005 \n October 2005 \n September 2005 \n August 2005 \n July 2005 \n June 2005 \n May 2005 \n April 2005 \n March 2005 \n February 2005 \n January 2005 \n December 2004 \n November 2004 \n October 2004 \n September 2004 \n August 2004 \n July 2004 \n June 2004 \n May 2004 \n April 2004 \n November 2003 \n November 2001 \n\n\n\t  \t    \n\n\t        \n\n\n\t    \n\n\n\n\t  \n\t\n\t    Meta\n\n\t\t\tLog in\n\tEntries (RSS)\n\tComments (RSS)\n\tEmail the newsbloggers\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n    \tContact Details\n\n        Hosting generously provided by \n            Mythic Beasts\n\n        \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n",

The development control service has exceeded all three national \ntargets by a significant margin. \n \n3.2 The Service continues to achieve top quartile nationally (local target) across two of the \nthree categories of planning applications (minors and others), which is highly \ncommendable representing a consistently high level of performance.  As with the second \nquarter of the year, the speed with which the ‘major’ applications are being determined has \nfallen below the top quartile standard achieved last year. This is predominantly a result of \nthe reduced number of smaller, more straightforward ‘major’ applications received which \ncan normally be decided within the 13-week period.  These decisions tend to \ncounterbalance those made on the larger scale ‘major’ applications which are unable to be \ndecided within 13-weeks because of the complexity of issues.   \n \n3.3 Officers are seeking to improve overall performance in three main ways: \n \na) Increase the capacity of professional planning officers by training the support team \nto carry out some of the tasks currently undertaken by planning officers e.g. appeal \nquestionnaires and associated documentation, and \nb) The more junior planning officers are being developed to enable them to take on \nsome of the more difficult cases thereby freeing up senior officers to focus on the \nlarger scale schemes. \nc) A ‘general enquiries’ phone number has been set up which is operated by Support \nTeam officers.  This has had the effect of reducing the number of general calls \ntaken by planning officers which allows them to focus on the professional work for \nwhich they are trained. \n \n3.3 Planning appeal performance is no longer a national performance indicator.  It is however \na good indicator of the quality of decisions taken by the Council and as such this will \ncontinue to be monitored and reported to Members.  Overall performance in the third \nquarter of the year was similar to the national average (33%) and is not a cause for \nconcern.  The overall figure does however disguise some more specific areas where \nperformance is far below the national average.  The fact that 65% of appeals against the \ndecisions of South Area Planning Committee and 67% of those of Central Committee were \nallowed does indicate an area that needs to be monitored and addressed.  Officers and \nthe Chairmen and Vice-Chairmen of all 4 planning committees considered the issue at \ntheir recent quarterly meeting. \n \n4.0 RECOMMENDATION \n \n4.1 Members are requested to note this report. \n \n 3\nCentral Area Planning Committee - \n                             4th March 2010APPEAL PERFORMANCE \n \n01/04/09 – 31/12/09 \n \n North Central South  Totals \n \nTotal No. of Appeals Decided 12 25 30 67 \n \nSuccessful Appeals (Dismissed) 11.5 16 17.5 45 \n \nAppeals Allowed 0.5 9 12.5 22 \n 0% 36% 38% 33% \nAllowed on Appeal where Officer's 0 2 7.5 9.5 \ndecision was for Permission   \nNo of Delegated decision which went 8 19 17 44 \nto Appeal    \nNo. Allowed 0.5 5 4 \nNo. Dismissed 7.5 14 13 \nPercentage of Appeals Allowed 0% 26% 24% \nNo. of Committee Decisions which 4 6 13 23 \nwhen to Appeal    \nNo. Allowed 0 4 8.5 \nNo. Dismissed 4 2 4.5 \nPercentage of Appeals Allowed 0% 67% 65% \n \n \n  \n 4\nCentral Area Planning Committee - \n                             4th March 2010\n",

It should, I hope, play an important part in this country�??s Christian revival.\n\n \n\nThe reason lies in some basic principles of marketing.\n\n \n\nThe biggest threat to a product is very often not competition but the lack of it, with resultant consumer apathy leading to market stagnation or decline.\n\n \n\nPut simply, when one has a long-established, well-known, well-loved even, but somewhat generic product, i.e. when the product is the market, it can be very difficult to maintain a high degree of positive interest and engagement among its users.\n\n \n\nBut if and when competition arrives (and it usually does), it forces a re-evaluation of attitudes and creates an opportunity for the product to re-connect with a market suddenly forced to a point of choice. Suddenly �??consumers�?? are faced with the need to make a conscious decision about whether and what to buy. In such circumstances, growth in the overall market is not an uncommon occurrence. The resurgence of board games in general, and Monopoly in particular, after the market entry of Trivial Pursuit is such an example.\n\n \n\nFor too long, the British public has been able to dodge the �??God choice�?? �?? is there or isn�??t there? �?? by scribbling C of E on their hospital admission form. But now atheists are challenging us to make that choice one way or another. And they are doing so at a most opportune time.\n\n \n\nThis country has never been more prosperous or more satiated with material possessions, yet research shows that its inhabitants are no happier for it and, in some ways, are significantly unhappier.\n\n \n\nThe �??Big Questions�?? �?? �??Who am I?�??; �??Why am I here?�??; �??Where am I going?�?? �?? become ever more insistent as they are demonstrably not answered by financial security and material possessions (and the credit crunch and global recession now threaten even those).\n\n \n\nOther research has shown that the majority of Christians would be happy to talk about their faith with other people and to share their Christ-informed perspective on the Big Questions �?? but only �??if it comes up�??. Natural British reserve coupled with the traditional view that religious faith is a taboo topic at the dinner party table, have conspired to encourage Christians to keep their heads down and their faith private.\n\n \n\nWhat is needed, what advertising can provide, and what the atheist campaign opens the door toward, is a very public debate on the existence and nature of God. Faith in God (or, indeed, its opposite) cannot be sold from a billboard, but advertising can create a context in which �??it comes up�?? more often, and in which one-to-one conversations �?? the virus of faith �?? can flourish.\n\n \n\nChristians need to be able to respond appropriately. That may mean developing their own on-going ad campaign, comprising engaging, thought-provoking, biblically-sound advertising concepts rooted in human experience. But it will also mean engaging respectfully, constructively and appropriately to the God-conversations when they come up.\n\n \n\nIf they can do that, they may end up having a lot to thank atheist buses for.\n\n\n\nMike Elms is a Fellow of The Marketing Society and a management consultant specialising in the advertising and marketing sector. He was formerly Chief Executive of ad agencies Ogilvy & Mather and Tempus/CIA.\n\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    105\n\n\nJump to Latest\n    Comment \n\n    The debate\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Nicholas\n                    \n                        3 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nMuch muddle in this article.\n\nWater and electricity, for example, are generic products. The token competition in the energy market has not increased demand for electricity. The absurd competition between expensive and inefficient bottled water and indistinguishable tap water has not increased consumption of water.\n\nWhere is this \"research\" that shows that we are unhappier than in, say, 1850, when women frequently died in childbirth, and children frequently died young?\n\nWhich are the \"Big Questions\"? Are they the silly \"Who am I?\", \"Why am I here?\" and, forsooth, \"Where am I going?\", to all of which there are obvious answers, and on none of which the historical or legendary Jesus offered any \"perspective\". (Except, possibly, the historical Jesus's delusion that his comtemporaries were about to see the End of the World and the Coming of his \"Kingdom\".)\n\nOr is it the existence and nature of god(s)? I agree that \"There's probably no God\" on a few buses might, just might, start a few conversations at the bus stop. But I can't see it starting a \"very\" (as opposed to slightly?) public debate. Hope I'm wrong: can't wait to see some \"biblically-sound advertising concepts rooted in human experience\". Examples, please. And will there be Koranically-sound and Book-of-Mormonically sound competition?\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Nicholas\n                    \n                        3 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nPS: Hope we get rival campaigns on the lines \"It's only Y_hw_h's grace that stops you from being a serial rapist\", and \"After your death, you'll be judged on your good works, if any.\"\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Zak Bishrey\n                    \n                        3 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nNicholas: I think you are being rather hard on Mike. He is a specialist in marketing and knows only too well that advertising in clever hands will do wonders to a product, whether it is Christianity or margarine that you can�??t tell from butter. It is the copywriter�??s art that persuades people to spend millions on a �??moisturiser�??, not because it is jellified water but because they have been bludgeoned into believing that �??they are worth it�??.\n\n\nNevertheless, I am a little surprised that Mike should employ the same technique on a forum visited by such as Nicholas and Greywizard, as he does on a marketplace populated by plebs! Apart from that, my only beef with the bus is that it exhibits the word �??Probably�??. In engineering, if the probability is considerably less than one in a trillion, then it is safely considered to be zilch.\n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Greywizard\n                    \n                        3 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nI agree with Nicholas that there is plenty of muddle in Mike's article, but the real muddle starts right at the beginning, when he disingenuously thanks Dawkins for opening up a discussion on the reasons for religious belief. Hoping to silence the so-called new atheism in its tracks, Christians keep issuing the warning that nothing has helped them more than the militancy of atheism. Yea, sure, that's why they're so strident right back.\n\n\n\nIn a straight up discussion religions will lose, every time. It's only when they start pulling the authority card - as Mike does in speaking about the rather odd-sounding biblically-sound advertising slogans (this must be a first!) - that they start to win - well, so long as people are trained to respond to it.\n\n\n\nThere are no respectable critical arguments in favour of religion and religious beliefs. You can tell this because at this point religious people always bring up the bogus questions: Who am I? Why am I here? Where do I come from? These are not real questions. They are types of obfuscation, well-known to religious apologists. (This is, by the way, the whole premise of the Alpha course. Everyone is walking around with a burden of these questions, and, of course, Christianity of a rather lacklustre character, has all the answers. Who knew?!) If you can bamboozle someone into thinking that these are real questions, you might get a bit of mileage out of them, but it's a pretty hard sell just now.\n\n\n\nThat's why people whip out the 'C of E' tag when religion is mentioned. It's easier than discussing ideas they find slightly embarrassing. Why does Mike think that the C of E is the church that most people stay away from? Mike may be an advertising expert, but I don't think he can sell his holy water. On the other hand, the atheist adverts may have some leverage. It might help people to see that they are not alone.\n\n\n\nAs to the word 'probably', Zak. This is really the only option for someone of purports to be critical. Proofs of non-existence are hard to come by. But, I agree, they could use 'very probably' instead, or something like, 'There is an extremely low probability that there is a god.' Of course, it's a gentle introduction to scepticism. Give it time. It will come.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Paul Rodden\n                    \n                        3 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nI'm with GreyWiz, Nicholas, and Zak, on this one so far...\n\n\nAs to the phrase, \"thought-provoking, biblically-sound\", the people I know who are 'biblically sound', are often, sadly, thought-provokingly challenged.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Nicholas\n                    \n                        3 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nAriane Sherine has put on record her reason for the 'probably': to be sure of not flouting the advertising code.\n\nIt is, by the way, often possible to prove non-existence. Once you've defined integers, you can prove that there is no pair of integers such that the square of one is double the square of the other. And it is certain that there is no human that can fly without any mechanical aid. And it is certain that there is no omnipotent entity which cares about the continual suffering of most life-forms on this planet. There could however be any number of preternatural entities that enjoy suffering, or haven't got enough powers to limit it on this planet.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Paul Rodden\n                    \n                        3 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nAs I think about it more, so I'm concerned this article reinforces the atheists' view that all Christians see 'witness' as an exercise of proof-texting, apologetics, and some sort of 'intellectual' callisthenics - 'Mental Masturbation', as us Catholics used to call it at uni. - as the bible-bashers rarely had girl friends, were intellectually short-sighted, and seemed to get off on it. I once read a quotation attributed to Bertrand Russell which said that, \"If a man can be argued into faith, he can be argued out of it just as easily\", and that makes eminent sense, to me, even if it wasn't him.\n\n\nBut, that's what's so perverse about Dawkins' advertising campaign. It sums up everything that's revolting, patronising, and cringe-making about bible-bashers, but it's just people like him doing it instead. Surely, it's a wind-up by Dawkins, and the article's fallen right into the trap? Or, are these kind of atheists really no different from the sort of Christians called 'fundamentalists', as many thinking Christians maintain?\n\n\nMy problem with the 'witnessing Christians' is that they sound, at best, more like they're trying to convince themselves of the truth of their viewpoint, than any one else, and at worst, they merely like the sound of their own voice. Whatever, anyone who'll listen, has to listen to their agenda. They have little or no interest in their 'victim's' point of view (apart from what they've been told to believe about it by their pastors), yet call it, 'loving them in the Lord'. With this campaign, Dawkins and his followers are 'ramming their message down our throats', aren't they? But, isn't that the very thing of which we're accused, by them? (However, stopping worry and enjoying life would be two of the things to which a Chritian might point as benefits of being a person of faith, too.)\n\n\nIf I were an atheist, I'd be embarrassed by this latest stunt by Dawkins as it utterly trivialises the debate, as do some Christians, as GreyWiz points out, \"You can tell this because at this point religious people always bring up the bogus questions: Who am I? Why am I here? Where do I come from? These are not real questions. They are types of obfuscation, well-known to religious apologists.\".\n\n\nBut, 'the atheists' are now pushing their own self-centred agenda (and believing religion is just as their pastors, Dawkins and Hitchens, say it is) as much as the 'witnessing Christians', with this advert. Both encourage one to reflect on oneself in a narcissistic manner, and both seem to be more the product of the deep-seated introjection of modern psychobabble in society's consciousness, than anything genuinely scientific ('certainty') or religious ('fideism').\n\n\nFor me, God cannot be a product to be sold or merely a concept to be debated if one really believes He is the Creator and Sustainer of the Universe, and that Jesus Christ is its Redeemer. To use Him as such a football I find rather sacrilegious, and why I rarely bring God into these discussions. But also, why I don't try any smart-alec apologetics either, with people who clearly show no interest. This would be denying them their freedom if I tried to impose my religion on them like a 'witnessing Christian'.\n\n\nBut, I can play them at their own game, by not so much arguing for my point of view - which is flawed because it's human - but by showing that a real debate can't even begin if it is clear they overstate their own claims, or deny the weaknesses of their own position, in a purely philosophical manner, particularly when they claim what they claim about the superiority of their 'reason' and 'science'. As I've said many times, I don't want to knock reason and science but, like Michael Shermer said in his article previously quoted, the way they 'argue' is often not reasonable or scientific, and so makes them their own worst enemy: God, or no God.\n\n\nSo, \"Who will atheist buses benefit?\": Anyone who pockets the money (currently standing at £116,454.76)\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Zak Bishrey\n                    \n                        4 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nI would like the �??bus drivers�??, if they are reading this posting, to answer this easy question: Which God is it on the bus? I don�??t mean which of the 1685 on my list, whose domains and characteristics are too clearly defined to allow any misinterpretation, but which of the 15 one-and-only gods whose personalities and spheres of influence seem to change endlessly (usually depending on the size and strength of the battalions of their followers). Nay, I will go further and narrow them down to just four:\n\n\n1) The Muslims are very clear about their Allah being the one-and-only god, proclaiming: �??La Elah illa Allah�?? (There is no god but Allah). Who am I to argue?\n\n\n2) The Jews are very clear about their YHWH being the one-and-only god, shouting from the roof tops: �??Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad�?? (Listen Israel, the Lord [Adonai here is substituting for the ineffable YHWH] is our one-and-only Lord�??). Who am I to argue?\n\n\n3) The Kurds, the Persians, and many others in India and south-east Asia admit to no other god but their one-and-only Khuda. Who am I to argue?\n\n\n4) Leaving aside the Russian Bog, the Baltic Dievs and a handful of other one-and-only gods, there is of course the Trinity. I am including him (them) in the category of one-and-only god(s), even though the argument about that entity which raged in the third century has not been resolved yet, but with my wife looking over my shoulder, who am I to argue?\n\n\nMy aim is to clarify a point, not to be mischievous. All I want to know is which God is it on the bus? Is it Allah or YHWH or Khuda or the nameless Trinity? What is certain is that they cannot all be one-and-the-same. If you find this assertion difficult to swallow, read the Old Testament, the New Testament, the Koran, and there are several good publications on Zoroastrianism also.\n\n\nFor god�??s sake which?\n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Paul Rodden\n                    \n                        4 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nWhy do you spend so much time talking about and trying to refute something you don't believe in, Zak?\n\n\nAs I've implied before, if I don't believe something, I don't spend hours thinking up refutations of it.

I know these exist, but I don't join forums to discuss them. They are of no interest.\n\n\nFor me, there's a direct correlation between something's existence, and interest, but for you there isn't because the correlation and interest you have is purely with something you say doesn't exist.

Why is the iPod so popular? Because you can shut yourself off from the rest of the world whilst travelling. Furthermore, if we assume the average journey will take around a quarter of an hour, perhaps a little longer with adverse traffic conditions, it's not a vast amount of time to discover the meaning of life.  \n\n\n\n\n\nI wonder if Mike will oblige us with greater detail of the \"other research\"  that has shown that the majority of Christians who are only too happy to share their \"Christ-informed perspective\". It all depends on who they asked. If, say, it was the people who run and attend the Alpha Courses, then for sure it's probably very difficult to shut them up - but most ordinary civvies, particularly people of middle-age and older still tend to be undemonstrative about their religion and politics.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I understand it, Richard Dawkins has donated a sum of of money for these adverts on buses as a half-humourous response to the to the way-out Evangelical posters which threaten all sorts of doom and gloom for those who do not let Jesus into their lives. No doubt there will be an Xtian counter poster with a pithy remark from their point of view, but even the slickest, most dynamic advertising campaign can be fairly easily derailed - who, now, can take the 2012 Olympic Games logo seriously once it has been pointed out that it forms the uncanny silhouette of the cartoon character Lisa Simpson obliging an older gentleman with an act of fellatio?\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Paul Rodden implies, the only people who will benefit from this are the advertising executives who can see huge returns on ramping up yet another format war - following on the heels of  Blu-Ray vs. HDD, Apple Mac vs.PC we shall see Atheist vs.Christian on the advertising billboards. All rather pointless and likely to take away resources from the more charitable activities of the Church.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Paul Rodden\n                    \n                        4 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nI think the type of Christian that believes advertising campaigns work, and that our Lord should be sold like washing powder (pace Mike Elms, should take up Richard Dawkins' gauntlet, get someone to match the first £5500, and set up a page:\n\n\nhttp://www.justgiving.com/theistbus\n\n\nI notice that one of the givers today (04-NOV) has been heckling the Alpha website and been censored (giver: unHolier than thou).\n\n\nWe obviously provide a ministry to some of those sad individuals to whom no one else listens - 'no one else' being probably their fellow atheists - who think they're just barking...\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Paul Rodden\n                    \n                        4 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nWell, I posted, and there was Scarthin Nick, who's anticipated me on the above...\n\n\nOh, yes, the 2012 Olympic Games logo...makes it memorable, now, thanks, S-N.

I ask this because most blogs seem to be full of men (I'm not being sexist here, bloggers do seem to be mostly male, especially when the subject is God) who are only interested in scoring intellectual points off other men who disagree with them; if this is the case please ignore my comments, as I'm sure you are probably much cleverer than me. Still, assuming that you are sincere, maybe I can just sketch very roughly some kind of answer.\n\n\n\n\n\nBelievers down the centuries have not been blind to the existence of different ideas of God, and have dealt with the issue of the plurality of gods in three main ways. Exclusivists say that their god is the only one, and all the others are false. Inclusivists say that, whilst theirs is the truest religion, there is truth in others too, and maybe God saves through these other religions. For Pluralists, saying your religion is the best is equivalent to saying that your mum is the best mum in the world, (of course she is, she yours) and that all religions can be different ways to God, some truer than others maybe, but all capable of 'saving' in so far as the religion fosters a true relationship with God.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere have been advocates of all these positions in all the major religions for centuries, though it is probably true to say that the semitic religions have been much more exclusivist generally. Muslims have traditionally regarded Jews and Christians as fellow believers; indeed in some traditions, anyone who belives in a holy book is a believer. I think also you'll find that most devout Jews do not regard everyone else as damned; in fact the rabbis long ago rejected the idea of Hell. There are of course Exclusivists in all the religions; I have a feeling that it's only the logic of their position which stops some atheists from consigning believers to Hell. \n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, lots of valuable work has been done by Christian theologians in more recent times; if you are interested in a pluralist account of religion which has won widespread multi-faith acclaim, try 'An Interpretation of Religion' by John Hick.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm sorry if these remarks seem very simplistic, I do realize they are, and Hick says it much better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Greywizard\n                    \n                        4 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nPaul, the only trouble with your priest friend's \"Dawkins is probably a fraud\" is that it's likely untrue, and could be construed as slander.\n\n\n\nMichael, I have always been interested in pluralist interpretations of religious beliefs. I can remember (I go back quite far) the book entitled The Hidden Christ of Hinduism, though I'm not sure that Hindus were pleased. And this points up part of the problem. Descriptions of gods a very various, and it does seem a bit of a stretch to suggest that different religions are all ways to the same god or gods. In fact, understood like that, polytheists are particularly difficult to fit within the scope of that claim. And, given that Catholics are so ready to pray to Mary and all the saints, as well (a veritable potpourri of gods and godlets), it's hard to know what the one thing is towards which all religions aim. Recently we had the spectacle of King Faud trying to appeal to his brothers in monotheistic faith to band together to defeat the great Satan, atheism. I don't think he got much of a response, especially since, despite the fact that people of the book are commended in the Koran, Christians and Jews under Islam were (or are or may yet be) Dhimmi, and required to pay the jizya tax, could not sit in the presence of a Muslim, could not overtake them, and were not permitted to ride horses, or to bear arms. (I wonder how this translates in terms of modern means of transport.) Despite the brave attempts of a few Christian ecumenicalists (to vary the word 'ecumenist' to take in people of other religions), who sought to diminish Christian exclusivism, the exclusivism is written into the founding documents: the Chosen People, only through Christ, the House of Peace and the House of War. These will always cycle around, and leave poor John Hick in the dust. It's not what exclusivists say; it's what their documents say that counts, because, in each case, these are taken to be holy texts, and what they say continues to be said, no matter what the generosity of a few brave souls like Hick may say.\n\n\n\nAs to consigning anyone to hell. To my knowledge only Christianity and Islam do that. The Koran is simply full of such condemnations, on almost every page. Christianity is a bit more reserved, but no less definite. (Just search the word 'hell' in your computer Bible, if you have one. It's an eye-opener.) I hope that no sane person would seek to consign anyone to a lake of everlasting fire. It is, I hope, not only logic, but humanity, which would lead atheist humanists to forbear.\n\n\n\nNicholas. First, I am not a realist in mathematics, so the proof of the non-existence of certain integers is a matter of logic, not metaphysics. Second, describing natural things, and then defining them in ways inconsistent with their nature, is not proving the non-existence of anything. It is just saying of an existing thing that it, say, cannot do certain things without assistance. A human being who can spend an hour under water without breathing apparatus does not exist. But human beings, with certain determinate characteristics which makes this impossible, do. But, even then, you never know. Prove to me that no human being can stay underwater for an hour without breathing apparatus, or fly without mechanical assistance. Now, prove to me that there are no fairies at the bottom of your garden.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Paul Rodden\n                    \n                        4 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nHello Michael Cook. I don't think what you're saying is simplistic at all, but they provide quite a bit of evidence to show they don't really care a fig about what we believe, anyway. If any thing's simplisitc, it's their advertising campaign.\n\n\nFor example, a common thread seems to be that Christians are meant to be moral. Christians aren't moral. Ergo, Christians, religions (and gods) are evil. Or, God is meant to answer prayer. God doesn't answer my prayer. Ergo, God doesn't exist - or some shade of this sort of thing. Now, they are simplistic, too. And both are contrary to what a mainline Chritian would believe about these things (and why I'm always puzzled by GreyWiz seems to accuse us of immorality, or God of not answering prayer, as he should know what the actual Christian position is these things, if he's read so much theology: this is one of his blindspots that he wanted me to point out). It's not about points scoring, but getting to a 'level playing field' before any real discusssion can begin.\n\n\nNow, although I find 'witnessing' repulsive, and believe it to be highly counter-productive to it's objectives (as well as sacriligeous), a fundamentalist Christian could point to the last two verses of the Gospel according to St Matthew, and argue that's why they do what they do. I think Matt 28:19-20 means far much more than crass advertising and talking, ad nauseam, about God on people's doorsteps or street corners, without any consideration of their victims, and any care as to what a pain in the butt they're being. But most of all, making out that God somehow needs our 'witness', which treats God as a football, a concept to be proved, or their interlocutor, a scalp to be won.\n\n\nBut, more to the point, where's the precedent that shows atheists and/or scientists have to 'witness' in the same way? Where's the law of physics, chemistry, or biology which commands them to preach atheism to the world? There isn't one. They can't point to anything within their worldview which justifies are points them to what I would consider the very, simlistic, crass, and irrational action of 'witnessing' or proselytising atheism through this advertising campaign. They seem to be so obsessed with undermining religion, it's rapidly becoming the very thing it reviles: a Reaction Formation.\n\n\nNow, if they can point to reasonable or scientific evidence as to why something that doesn't exist needs to be advertised so urgently and ubiquitously, rather than it being merely a highly irrational and neurotic response to something with which they fear or disagree, I wait to hear.\n\n\nSo, Fr Finnegan's parody, \"Dawkins is probably a fraud. Now stop worrying and go to Mass\", shows just how vacuous the real advert is. The truth content of both the original and his is no different because of the 'probably'. (Maybe it should be designed like an advert for Heineken...) So, no, GreyWiz, it isn't slander.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Greywizard\n                    \n                        4 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \n\"Now, if they can point to reasonable or scientific evidence as to why something that doesn't exist needs to be advertised so urgently and ubiquitously, rather than it being merely a highly irrational and neurotic response to something with which they fear or disagree, I wait to hear.\"\n\n\n\nThus, Paul Rodden.\n\n\n\nWhat is one to say in response to this? Well, a simple, you don't understand, might do for starters. And, Paul, you don't. For some reason you seem to think that, if it can't be expressed in scientific language, people who do not believe in the existence of a god or gods can say nothing at all. But why should this be the case? What is stop someone like Dawkins, who has studied religion and its effects, much as you might do, coming to the conclusion that there is something a bit worrisome about its claims and its effects? Certainly, he might want to speak about religion in scientific, perhaps sociological or anthropological, terms. He might want to talk about religion in respect to its metaphysical claims, as he does. Nothing like this is ruled out by the fact that he is a scientist or a reasonable person, who does not entertain beliefs in supernatural entities.\n\n\n\nHe might reasonably believe, based on a survey of some of the evidence, that religious beliefs can be very dangerous, and lead to serious consequences contrary to human welfare and flourishing. In the light of this, he might well suggest to others, in books or bus ads, that we are better off without belief in gods. Nothing of this is ruled out by his being a scientist or a reasonable human being. Why should it be so?\n\n\n\nSo, if you want to claim that Dawkins is a fraud, you must have much more to go on than this. Indeed, I am beginning to suspect that you may be a bit of a fraud to suggest such ridiculous things. Is Paul Rodden a fraud? Or does he have something substantive to back up his collection of nonsense syllables?\n\n\n\nSo, once again, let's take another quote: \"Where's the law of physics, chemistry, or biology which commands them to preach atheism to the world? There isn't one.\" Of course there isn't. But why does that matter? Do we need to have commands before we do something we think it right to do? It may be so for Christians - though I understood that you did not subscribe to the divine command theory - but for others, there are all sorts of reasons for doing things. Just encouraging people to believe what is true, and question beliefs which cannot be substantiated, is a good reason to suggest to them that 'probably God does not exist.' Why do you think we need another?\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Heath Hayes\n                    \n                        4 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nBoys, boys �?? it�??s getting a bit heated and personal again!

And Greywizard - or can I call you Eric? - if you keep writing to me in German, when both you and I are English, I shall expose you in the popular press.  Or something similar.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Paul Rodden\n                    \n                        4 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nGreyWiz, you say: \"So, once again, let's take another quote: \"Where's the law of physics, chemistry, or biology which commands them to preach atheism to the world? There isn't one.\" Of course there isn't. But why does that matter? Do we need to have commands before we do something we think it right to do?\"\n\n\nWhich shows you agree you can't derive an ought from an is - which means to you, Ethics is relative - so a) why criticise religious people who are violent, as it's only your opinion, and b) if you think a) should be censored or prevented, then the only resort you have, is to power and force, because they're not wrong within their own frame of reference.\n\n\nOf course I'm a fraud, GreyWiz. I don't know how many times I've said as much. I have to play a role - that of playing you at your own game. I'm not like this in real life, but I'm not going to let you get away with your claims of reason where there isn't any.\n\n\nYour problem with me is that I'm not a fundie, and Dawkins, you Zak, Nicholas, and most of the rest have only arguments against fundies - of whatever flavour. You have to accuse us of irrationality, even if we're not, because your house of cards is built upon some grossly distorted premises about the weaknesses of 'all' Christians, which are, in fact, only the weaknesses of fundamentalists of the literalist sort.\n\n\nNo. Dawkins hasn't \"studied religion and its effects\", if by that, you mean anything apart from that which agrees with his own viewpoint.\n\n\nYou do the same. For an ex-Christian you seem remarkably ignorant. BUT, I know that you're not really. What is the case, is that you have had to suppress some of the things you know in order to place your case in many of your arguments because you know that many of us don't believe what you say we do, but it's the only way you can make a point at all.\n\n\nThat is why I asked previously why you are not silent? Empiricism can't prove religion, just as much as it can't refute it.\n\n\nI'm silent about a flat earth, UFOs, dogs, cats, gerbils because I either don't believe in them, or they are of no interest.\n\n\nSo, you don't need commands to do anything, but what I'm puzzled by, is the motive - that is what I'm trying to ascertain, as I've said.\n\n\nIf the motive's not a command, not anything you can derive from reason or science, and not even revealed, what is the motive? There doesn't seem to be one for which you can give any rational or scientific reason. Therefore, it must be something rather simpler: prejudice, partisanship, and bias, posing as reason and science.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Greywizard\n                    \n                        4 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nWell, Paul, we're getting a bit off topic here really. This is supposed to be about atheist buses! Not something I'm particularly keen on, and certainly something I'm not contributing to. However, I'm puzzled by your repeated, and unsubstantiated claim, that someone who does not believe in a god or gods has no reason to be moral. According to you, if you can't deduce ought from is then you must be a relativist. You'll have to show that, since it's almost certainly not true.\n\n\n\nLet's take Kant, for example. He reduced the whole or morality to one categorical claim, that we should act in such a way that the principle of our action could be made a universal law. Now, Kant certainly was not a relativist, but neither did he think that ought could be derived from is. I'm not even sure that Hume's principle is correct, but, even assuming that it is, there is no reason why there should not be a realm of valuing, as Hume understood it, that is independent of any empirical claim that we make about the world (aside, of course, from the activity of valuing itself).\n\n\n\nAwhile ago you were exalting vitue ethics and so-called 'natural law'. Neither of these are scientifically provable, I assume, and neither is dependent upon the existence of a god or gods. So, what's the problem here? Why, suddenly, should we suppose that people who don't believe in a god are motiveless? There are all sorts of motives, and not all of them self-interested ones.\n\n\n\nTell you what. Why don't you learn something about moral philosophy and then come back, and perhaps having this discussion would make more sense. You seem to be under the strange misapprehension that belief in a god is the only thing that can give us reasons for action. Anyone who has ever seen someone in distress, or has seen a beautiful person of the opposite sex (and even, for a significant minority, of the same sex), knows that this is not true. So, tell me why we have to have either a command (from whom, I wonder? - perhaps, as Kant thought, from reason itself!), or something revealed, in order to have a reason to do something. This is really bordering on the ridiculous. As I say, go away for awhile, learn something about morality - not just religious morality, but the whole subject of moral reasoning - start with Plato's Euthyphro - and then come back, and then, perhaps, we can have a profitable discussion. So far, what you say makes no sense at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, Heath, you may not call me by my first name. And as for humour... Well, is the pope catholic? That may after all be a reasonable question. I suggest that he is not, and that his image of the catholic church is a form of idolatry, of a peculiarly low and disreputable kind.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Paul Rodden\n                    \n                        5 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nGreyWiz, I repeat the gist of my point: if I didn't believe X, I wouldn't put £5,500 into advertising X didn't exist. There's no rational or scientific reason for advertising something that you don't think exists, on a bus, apart from some ideological, emotional, or pathological ones, is there?\n\n\nThe 'logic' behind this campaign is a bit like sticking a sign on my garden gate saying, \"BEWARE: NO DOG\", isn't it? What reasonable purpose would that serve? Why put a sign if there's no dog? Should I put up signs telling people there's no concrete, no chocolate, no moon, in my garden either? I'm not putting up a 'proof for the existence of God' here, as much as show how ludicrous it is to advertise something that's 'not there' to your way of thinking about things.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Greywizard\n                    \n                        5 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nNo, Paul, that's not right. Of course, if people like Dawkins feels that religion is a dangerous force in society and in the world, then he has every reason to encourage people not to believe. The point of taking a sceptical point of view towards beliefs which may be dangerous, and which cannot be, with any show of reason, decisively confirmed, seems fairly clear. Take British society, where there is a large and growing Muslim minority, whose views of many things, despite the Vatican \"summit\", are very different, and perhaps disquietingly so, to the beliefs of Christians or unbelievers. It makes sense, in a situation like this, to encourage scepticism - which is what a sign saying that there probably is no god would be doing. Nothing ideological, pathological or even emotional about it. Just a simply statement of what is likely the case. The point, of course, is not so much to get people to disbelieve in the existence of a god or gods, but to get them to start thinking reasonably about their beliefs. So, no, it's not like saying, 'BEWARE! NO DOG!'. (Good joke though!) It's like saying to someone who is afraid of dogs, 'In the absence of signs of dogs, don't worry about them.' You clearly think that believing in a god is important. Some people are beginning to think, with the competition of religions all around them, that perhaps it is important not to believe in a god, unless there really is one, and that is something that remains to be shown. So, why not point it out?\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Nicholas\n                    \n                        5 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nBEWARE: NO DOG is indeed a good joke - thanks, Paul. Now, consider a fantasy. Suppose no-one has ever seen a dog, and canis familiaris is a species unknown to science. Meanwhile, humans tell many enthralling tales about Cerberus and the Hound of the Baskervilles, and a dog called Lassie which saved drowning babies etc. And then suppose there are lots of generally good and well-meaning people who say that Lassie is the Creator and Sustainer of the Universe, and the source of human ethics, and is to be known as Dog.\n\nIf all that had come to pass, then there would, I think, be something to be said for putting on buses \"There are great stories about dogs, but they are only stories.\" And, personally, I think a message on those lines would, in this fantasy, be preferable to THERE'S PROBABLY NO DOG. Because of the use of block capitals, this uncritically hides the switch from dogs to a particular dog to Dog.\n\nIf all powerful Christians were like John Hick, and admitted that the Incarnation is a story, and if there were comparable reformations in all the other big religions, I think there would be a lot less suffering, and no need for anti-religious polemic. I hope I'm wrong, but until now I've assumed that Theos's tendency is more towards exclusivism. It's great that Vatican prelates are talking to Muslims about love. But has the current Magisterum formally rescinded extra ecclesia nulla salvatio?\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Paul Rodden\n                    \n                        5 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nThere are plenty of things scientists don't see in which they believe. 'Constant conjuxion', for example. They know it occurs, but it's merely inductive: at any stage it might not be the case. Much of science is stochastical probabilities, i.e., based in mathematics, axioms (of which you seem to show an interest), and a priori assumptions - not evidence of the senses.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Michael Cook\n                    \n                        5 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nGreywizard: Speaking from my own experience, the vast majority of Christians, as well as people of other faiths, hold something like the inclusivist or pluralist positions described above. In all my years of listening to people, I think I've met two or three people who hold to the exclusivist position, and even a couple of these were obviously uncomfortable with the idea that the vast majority of humanity was going to burn. You can see the dilemma spelled out right back in the 14th century, when Mother Julian of Norwich can't quite equate the revelation that 'all shall be well' with the teaching of the church at that time.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm not really convinced it's the texts that are the problem. I read the same bible as my fundamentalist brothers and sisters, but we do so with different assumptions about how the text reveals God, or rather, I believe the text reveals God and they believe God revealed the text. \n\n\n\n\n\nPersonally, I would have thought that a plurality of religions would be perfectly compatible with the existence of one divine reality. If fact, unless God is some kind of Divine Dictator, then it's really only to be expected that people will come to different conclusions about his nature. Christians believe God is self-giving, non-coercive love, and if praying to Mary helps someone to find compassion in their hearts, then as far as I can see that person is a little closer to God; even if Mary isn't paying attention, God is.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd this goes for polytheists too, though true polytheism can be hard to find, as there usually turns out to be a supreme God who made all the others, and this is certainly the case with most versions of Indian religion.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the way, it's not just Christians and Muslims who believe in Hell; there are loads of Hells in Buddhism, though they tend to only last a few thousand years. There may well be similar beliefs in other faiths, but don't know enough about it to say. I do know that you vastly underestimate the influence of the ecumenical movement and multi-faith work. Go and speak to ordinary religious people and find out if they believe what you think they should (because of the texts).\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, you say you hope that atheist humanists would not succumb to hatred of religious believers. I'm sure you're right, except of course that not all atheists are humanists, and the 20th century doesn't give much hope that a lack of belief in God makes us nicer people.\n\n\n\n\n\nPS Try putting the word 'love' into your computer bible.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Nicholas\n                    \n                        5 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nDo you really think it possible, Michael Cook, that the talks at the Vatican could lead, eventually, to a joint statement on the lines \"'The Son of God' is a metaphor; we do not hold that Jesus was God/YHWH in human form. And the Koran reveals God/Allah; Allah did not reveal the Koran.\" In my experience, multi-faith discussions avoid all such hard questions. In contrast, scientists, at their best, tackle them. Once, some scientists thought they could see phlogiston escaping when a log burns. By careful experiment, other scientists showed that a better explanation is that, when a log burns, the cellulose etc is combining with oxygen, which you cannot see. Scientists don't (if they are wise) claim to understand 'ultimate reality'. But they do carry out experiments which can show that some explanations are false.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Greywizard\n                    \n                        5 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nMichael Cook. Just a short comment. It is true that many religionists are inclusivist, although I think you will find that the majority of religious believers are not so kindly expansive as all that. The problem is, even if a majority are inclusivists (which I doubt), the sacred texts are always there, just waiting to be read in a xenophobic way. I recall all the 'dialogue' about gay and lesbian relationships. But I also remember the intolerant 'remnant' who remained 'faithful' to the 'faith once delivered to the saints.'\n\n\n\nFor any belief system which depends upon exegesis, reversion to type is only one fanatic away.\n\n\n\nAs to statistical probabilities, Paul, you are quite correct. As Hume said, look as hard as you like, you won't see a cause. That's why the bus sign, presumambly, is a statement of improbability. But, in the end, though many scientific theories and their confirmation, do not provide confirming perceptions of the conjunction of electrons, quarks, or hicks bosons, what it does provide is empirical confirmation via ghe behaviour of particles in particle chambers which, in the end, can be read off some kind of measurement device which allows for empirical observation.\n\n\n\nWell, Michael, I did search for the word 'love' in my computer Bible. 448 occurrences for the whole Bible. 147 for the New Testament. Your point? When I try 'hell' I come up with fourteen references, ten in the gospels, one in James, one in Second Peter, and two in Esdras, intertestamental literature, the apocalyptic stream that was clearly very influential with Jesus, unfortunately.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Michael Cook\n                    \n                        5 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nGreywizard. I can only repeat that I have in fact found that most believers, even quite conservative ones, sense a contradiction between believing in a God of love, and the eternal damnation of large numbers of souls, and make some kind of accommodation for this. (There is a tradition in Islam that says even Satan will be forgiven at the end of time). \n\n\n\n\n\nThe sacred texts are not at all consistent on this point, and your fanatics have some pretty tough texts to get past if they're going to consign all non-believers to hell; the parable of the sheep and the goats being particularly thorny, as it seems to make salvation depend, not on belief at all, but on whether we treat those in need with compassion. My point in asking you to search for the word love (after you asked me to search for the word hell) is just to show that the hate-filled fundamentalists who you seem to take to be the typical religious type are not reading the Bible 'literally' at all, and are extremely selective and quite innovative in what they 'play up' and 'play down'. I do take your point though, that believing in sacred texts is potentially very tricky, which is why we need theologians, the very people that the likes of Dawkins thinks are a complete waste of time. (A point that is often neglected is that the fundamentalists hate theology too).\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's interesting that you use the example of  gay and lesbian people. As a gay man I know what it's like to have sacred texts used against me, but over the years I've realized that people bring their own prejudices to the texts. Neither is hate the exclusive preserve of religious people, or people who depend on the interpretation of texts. Do you really think that homophobia depends on people being religious? \n\n\n\n\n\nNear where I live there's a church where I feel very welcome, full of open-minded people who I sometimes go and share a sacred meal with. In the grounds of the church there is also a that most secular of establishments, a working men's club, and I know where I'd feel more comfortable being open about my sexuality.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncidentally, I think you'll find most of the 'hell' quotations from the gospels appear in (I think) Matthew, who seems to have had a bit of a thing about it. Anyway, 448 compared to 14. Love wins hands down.\n\n\n\n\n\nSorry there was nothing about buses in all this.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Paul Rodden\n                    \n                        5 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nGreyWiz, let's look at this quote of yours:\n\n\n\"Of course, if people like Dawkins feels that religion is a dangerous force in society and in the world, then he has every reason to encourage people not to believe. The point of taking a sceptical point of view towards beliefs which may be dangerous, and which cannot be, with any show of reason, decisively confirmed, seems fairly clear.\"\n\n\nIf we change that slightly to, \"Of course, if people like Benedict XVI (or Bishop Tom Wright, or any other reasonable Christian) feels that radical secularism is a dangerous force in society and in the world, then he has every reason to encourage people not to believe. The point of taking a sceptical point of view towards beliefs which may be dangerous, and which cannot be, with any show of reason, decisively confirmed, seems fairly clear.\", then that would be valid, too.\n\n\nI think Dawkins' views are dangerous, and I am sceptical of them because they don't show reason, but anaemic, selective bias and ideological partisanship. His sort of 'science' and its so called 'evidence' doesn't count for much.\n\n\nLets take genetic modification of crops, obesity, trans-fats, nuclear fuel, fossil fuels, for starters. Now, somewhere in any of these issues there might be some genuine scientific research.\n\n\nHowever, one could argue (as people do) that the scientists who work for government come up with evidence supporting the government's point-of-view because a) they're supportive of that party in power, b) the government chose them because they were saying what the government wanted to hear, and/or c) they'd come up with the results anyone wanted as long as they were paid enough.\n\n\nNow, those who disagree with the findings of these scientists, will provide diametrically contradictory scientific data and evidence, by eminent professors who are just as competent as the government scientists, and will be accused of the same things by government. What takes place next is a slanging match and accusations of bias of the sort mentioned above from both sides. That is both sides accuse each other of vested interests.\n\n\nSo now, if this sort of distortion, bias, partisanship, etc., happens between supposedly reasonable, scientifically-minded people, if not scientists themselves, and within a secular framework alone - it shows that this so-called scientific data and evidence is, in reality, ideological, and if there's more than two sides, highly unreliable, despite them all having samples, statistics, evidence, etc., to validate their 'science'.\n\n\nSo, frankly, your argument in that paragraph is both a perfect example of why religion has as much right in the public square, but also why Dawkins is actually as unreliable as any Christian. In fact he resembles the character of the worst sort: a fundamentalist.\n\n\nRemember, I'm not the one trying to show the uniqueness and superiority of my position, but just trying to mediate a fair starting point.\n\n\nI know the weakness of my point of view, and I know the weaknesses of yours. I admit the weaknesses of my position, and they are legion, but why don't you admit the weaknesses of yours? Which of us is taking real data of concrete experience and evidence seriously?\n\n\nWho would put an advert on a bus promoting some whacky belief? A fundamentalist.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Zak Bishrey\n                    \n                        5 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nMichael [C]: My question is serious and straightforward. It is not an enquiry into �??pluralism�??, �??atheism�??, �??inclusivism�?? or any other �??ism�??, but an attempt to find out if the bus slogan was meant to include all gods, and if not, why not? Or directed at one particular god, and if this is the case, which? I thank you for your serious reply and for the URL, but they do not answer my question.\n\n\nI studied the tenets of not only the three major religions in the West, but also those of the Chinese, Egyptians, Indians, Japanese, Persians, and a bewildering number of religious factions from the Baltic to the South Pacific. I find that where a faction believes in a pantheon of gods, there is usually one who is first among them; and where there is a belief in only one supreme being, it is always a belief that such entity is the faction�??s one-and-only god, and that to them it is unique, inimitable, and not an aspect or an avatar of any other deity.\n\n\nFor example, the one-and-only Atun of Amun-Hotep IV (Akhn-Atun), as far as I know, is not considered by the Israelites to be the same as the one-and-only �??I-Am-Who-I-Am�??, and if we leaf through the Koran we find that it is the one-and-only Allah who speaks to Moses, and to �??Pharaoh�??, and to Mary, and to the unbelievers. Are we to believe that the Jews consider Allah to be the same entity as YHWH, or that the Christians accept him as another name for the Holy Trinity, or that the Hottentots believe him to be none other than their supreme god Thixo? I don�??t think so.\n\n\nSo which god is it on the bus? The problem with the word god is that it represents nothing more than a notion. It is not a proper name whether the first letter is in the upper or lower case. We can trace the first recorded use of this generic term to the Sumerians and Babylonians who, in addition to having proper names for their gods, they used the generic term �??El�?? to refer to any god, not to a particular god, and most certainly not to a one-and-only god.\n\n\nThe Israelites being a Semitic people like the Babylonians, had no difficulty in using the Babylonian El to mean a god (as incorporated in numerous Jewish names). However, in its Hebrew plural form �??Elohim�?? (The Babylonian plural form is Elani), it is used to mean their one-and-only supreme being. It occurs 11 times in the first page of the Hebrew Genesis. The other Semitic people of Arabia (the Arabs) attached the definite article to the Babylonian El and ended up with Allah, the Muslims�?? one-and-only god. In my humble opinion, capitalising the first letter of a generic term for deities does not turn this generic term into a proper name, nor does the addition of the definite article. The question remains unanswered. To which particular god does the word God on the bus refer?\n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Michael Cook\n                    \n                        5 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nZac. I'm sorry I misunderstood your question about which God is on the bus. I'm afraid I have no opinion about that one, you'll have to ask the people who funded it what their intention is. Seems there is not a single word in the slogan that someone doesn't have a problem with; and I thought PCC meetings were bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nNicholas. I think it's unlikely the Vatican will come up with a pluralistic statement any time soon, but there are plenty of signs that make me hopeful that the religions are waking up to the fact that they need to talk to one another, and the Vatican documents on the subject already say that people of different faiths are to be respected (which is rather more than Dawkins and his acolytes do). There are already important Catholic theologians who hold versions of inclusivism, and I don't really know how you can say that multi-faith groups duck the issues; there is a vast literature on the subject. \n\n\n\n\n\nAnd something atheists miss out on completely is how different things can be at grass-roots level, rather than the 'official' position of a church. This is not hypocrisy, this is people thinking for themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\nI did at least mention the bus this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Greywizard\n                    \n                        5 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nLook, Paul, first of all, you have to understand how science works. It's not government scientists against other scientists, it's scientists working together in common, trying to find out the truth. Your picture of competing scientists (and of course there's a small grain of truth in that, but only very small) is a complete travesty of the way science works.\n\n\n\nLet's take one quote from your post: \"I think Dawkins' views are dangerous, and I am sceptical of them because they don't show reason, but anaemic, selective bias and ideological partisanship. His sort of 'science' and its so called 'evidence' doesn't count for much.\" Dawkins' views are dangerous? Which ones? And when you speak of 'his sort of 'science',' what do you refer to? His work in evolutionary biology? Or his book,The God Delusion? The latter book is, after all, not a book of science, but comes within the compass of (let us call it) philosophical theology. Certainly, in his arguments, though he uses his knowledge of biology to beef them up, the crucial role is played, not by science, but by other rational considerations. First, I have to ask, have you read the book? Second, if you have read the book, which parts of it are you saying are composed of 'his sort of science which isn't worth very much'?\n\n\n\nAs to his ideas being dangerous. Just what danger do you see involved here? I can point to some of the dangers of religious belief, because religious people are still acting as if they knew all the answers to the questions about right and wrong. The Roman Catholic Church has caused untold harm by its refusal to accept the use of condoms, to take but one example. This is one of the most inhuman things that could be conceived in an age of such dangerous STDs. Just saying no doesn't protect anyone, because we are just not built that way, and monkish virtue will only take us part of the way. And then we have Muslims with explosive belts going about killing fellow Muslims and others, or 13 year old girls being stoned to death because they were raped (as happened recently in Somalia), or Hindus going about killing Christians and Muslims, und so wieder. But which ideas of Dawkins's did you have in mind when calling his ideas dangerous? Name one dangerous idea, and show what harm it has done so far?\n\n\n\nMy point throughout here is that we try to give reasons for thinking things. Give me reasons that I can sink my teeth into. You can't just say that you see the weakness of your side, if you don't really see it. But Dawkins has put his point of view out there for everyone to discuss, and Christians have been loud and long in their execrations. I still haven't heard a good counterargument to Dawkins' arguments yet. But, you never know; maybe you'll be the one. But it has to be a real argument, a real reason; you can't just wave your arms around and expect that you've said something. Here's an example of wild and wooly arm waving: \"I know the weakness of my point of view, and I know the weaknesses of yours.\" In other words, you must be right on top of the truth. This won't do. This is mere prestidigitation or smoke and mirrors. Try again.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        tri-umph\n                    \n                        5 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nOh please; such self righteous secularist angst throughout. The message from Jesus Christ is far simpler many would have us believe.  Place the following quote near your heart, it may help:\n\n\n\n\n\nGod does not exist he is eternal, God does not think he creates.  \n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Greywizard\n                    \n                        5 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \n(A) 'God does not exist.' = 'For every x, where x is a god, x does not exist.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(B)He (God) is eternal.\n\n\n\n'There is an x, such that x is God and x is eternal.' = 'God exists and is eternal.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"'For every x, where x is a god, x does not exist.' and 'God exists and is eternal.'\" is a contradiction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul Tillich tried to say things like this, but it didn't really make any sense. You could opt for DZ Phillips way of saying that God does not exist, but it still doesn't seem to make much sense. You either say nothing, or at least something very odd, or you contradict yourself. Take your pick.\n\n\n\nActually, tri-umph (try harder), no angst, no self-rigtheousness, just an attempt to make sense.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Paul Rodden\n                    \n                        5 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \n\"Look, Paul, first of all, you have to understand how science works. It's not government scientists against other scientists, it's scientists working together in common, trying to find out the truth.\"\n\n\n- But they don't, do they? Or else why such diversity, and why so often - supposedly co-incidentally - disagreement when there's loads of contracts to be signed and money to be made. There is the rush for patents and funding, etc., which mitigates against collaboration.\n\n\nI'm not trying to form any 'conspiracy view', but just point out that if science was science, and not mired in the filth of 'worldly passions', like most other things, it could claim superiority. It doesn't, so it can't. It's just as messy, ideological, fraught with vested interests, sin, whatever, as the intrigue of any religion.\n\n\nWhy do you raise 'The God Delusion' to the rank of what you term, 'Philosophical Theology'? It's populist junk. Not because it's content's wrong, but that genuine Philosophical Theology is rather opaque to the lay reader. But as it's readership spans that of the tabloid reader, one has to question if it deserves a the title of such a grand discipline.\n\n\n\"First, I have to ask, have you read the book?\". Yes, and it read like a Sunday Supplement article, not something academically credible. I would suggest that anyone who wants to claim what he and Hitchens do, need to have something at the same level of, say, Charles Taylor's 'A Secular Age', not a collection of cheap party tricks and strings of informal fallacies.\n\n\nThat's what puzzles me GreyWiz. If you're interested in academe, surely you can only think that sort of dross is worth reading is for the sake of coherence, because to call it the crap it is, would dent your position considerably. So, do you just bite your tongue and argue that all that tosh is credible, just to keep the side up? Even Grayling, when he's writing about this sort of stuff suddenly writes as if he's had a lobotomy.\n\n\nSurely then, their aim is market saturation with their own ideology - keep it as simple as possible - so that those who can't reason can understand it just enough to think they're intelligent, and that by being able to regurgitate the 'arguments', is somehow thinking?\n\n\nThey're selling atheism like soap powder, like plenty of Christians sell God like soap powder. The trouble is, the only people who are taken in by either, are those who aren't intelligent enough to realise they're being treated as objects of commerce. Rich scientists, rich philosophers, rich Christians - all as a result of marketing something that promises to change their life and bring peace, happiness, whatever, with little or no personal cost.\n\n\nIt sells books and makes them rich, but the ubiquity of ideas doesn't make them true or reasonable, but I've said that before.\n\n\nDawkins put up £5500 for this campaign. How much do you think he's already set to make from interviews, lecturing invites, etc., as a result?\n\n\nFern Britton, Alan Carr, Paul O'Grady, Dawn French, Michael Parkinson...are doing the same thing. It's all just self-promotion.\n\n\nIf Dawkins' writing about 'science' or 'religion' was of the same style or calibre as a Polanyi or Lakatos, Macintyre or Taylor, then it would be worth reading.\n\n\nIf you're going to write about religion and science from a philosophical perspective, and want to be taken seriously, you need to do it in a manner which suits the discipline, not a colour supplement.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Greywizard\n                    \n                        5 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nPaul, Paul - listen to yourself! Let's take this first: \"not mired in the filth of 'worldly passions'.\" Who knew? Who knew that that's the take of the religious person on the world: 'the filth of worldly passions.' A true legatee of Augustine. Sure, there are competing voices, in science, in religion, everywhere. Not the filth of worldly passions at all - just something that comes naturally to passionate beings such as we.\n\n\n\nLet's take this one next: \"That's what puzzles me GreyWiz. If you're interested in academe, surely you can only think that sort of dross is worth reading is for the sake of coherence, because to call it the crap it is, would dent your position considerably.\" Well, I don't know. I know I had some problems with parts of it, and he probably could have profitted from trying to address some modern philosophy of religion, from Wittgenstein on, although I don't think it would have changed his conclusions much. I thought his burqa image was really over the top, for example. But I'm largely of Stephen Law's opinion - he did a 'book club' on The God Delusion (in which I did not participate, by the way, though I read Law's posts) - that, though there are some bloopers, by and large Dawkins tends to hit the nail on the head, and is not so easily dismissed as all that.\n\n\n\nYou speak of Grayling in this connexion, as though his writing about religion suggests someone with a lobotomy. I know, that's what lots of people seem to think. I wonder why? They say it, but then they don't respond. Or if, like Alister McGrath, they do, they muck things up so badly that they end up worse than they began.\n\n\n\nNow this one deserves our minute attention. \"Surely then, their aim is market saturation with their own ideology.\" How could you say such a thing? Have you ever taken a look at the outpourings of the religious press in the run of a year?!!!!! My Dog! If Dawkins et co wanted to saturate the market with an ideology, they'd have to work a lot harder than this! But truthfully, the real joke is that such a few books has discombobulated the religious forces so much, they've gone off like a string of firecrackers - with your own little 'pop!' at the end.\n\n\n\nAnd well, now, how about your parting shot? \"If you're going to write about religion and science from a philosophical perspective, and want to be taken seriously, you need to do it in a manner which suits the discipline, not a colour supplement.\" Dawkins wrote a book for ordinary people, a lot like the religious pabulum that's available almost anywhere -they've got entire stores devoted to the stuff! - give me strength Paul! - but a lot more bracing and better argued. If Dawkins had written a book like Taylor's - which, Dog forbid! - no one with any sense would read it. Taylor is a hard slog, not because he's so profound, but because he's so wrong on almost every page, while trying to sound profound. I can see why he won the Templeton prize! The Templeton Foundation likes its religion sophisticated and obscure. His introduction itself is a study in contradiction and misinformation - if you want I can give you my take on it. Dawkins was not writing an academic work, but a work addressed to ordinary people. And, by the look of it, he succeeded, if sales are anything to go by. What's the problem? CS Lewis has sold in the millions, and his is pretty light stuff. Why not Dawkins?\n\n\n\nWhich misses the point of the bus ad. It's directed towards ordinary people, many of whom are religious by reflex. Dawkins' work gives them a pause. Perhaps an ad would do the same. We are, I think, despite Theos and the pope and the C of E, and all the fundamentalists world-wide, undergoing a sea-change in belief. I think we will come out of it healthier than we went in, and much much less religious. That would be a sign of health indeed. Of course, religious forces might still lead to us blowing ourselves to smithereens. And then, perhaps, a world without us would develop in a much more healthy way. Who knows - since there clearly is no god.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        seculardemocrat\n                    \n                        5 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nGood of the Bible Society under the cover of Theos to chip in, after some initial scoffing about this campaign. Frankly £50 doesn�??t seem too generous against the £111,000 donated on-line and £24,000 contributed by the government (thanks Darling) but if it stops just one bible getting into the hands of an unsuspecting child some good will have been done. The religion industry is not going to have its own way from now on. The anger shown in the comments of donors against the interference by the religious in the lives of those who despise religion surprised even me.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        seculardemocrat\n                    \n                        5 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nOn the subject of marketing Christianity I wonder if Mike Elms has noticed the similarity between the marketing policy of the religion industry and that of the tobacco industry. As it gets harder to sell the product in the developed world, perhaps because of the growth of universal education, so the marketing effort moves to the developing world. Both industries are having considerable success with this tactic. Unfortunately this has rebounded on the C of E as the developing world consumers now want a bigger say in the product.\n\n\nOne difference�?� how the tobacco industry would love to be able to advertise its product in schools. But that is the subject of another debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Nicholas\n                    \n                        5 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nMichael C.: I agree with you that there are lots of Christians whose beliefs are much more sensible, and much less dangerous, than those set out, if you take the words literally, in the creed. I still think that Muslim-Christian dialogue, much as it is to be welcomed, skirts around the huge contradiction between traditional views of the authority of the Koran, and Jesus's supposed divinity. So can we jointly solicit subscriptions for bus adverts on the lines \"To be a Christian, you don't have to believe that Jesus was a god\". \"I don't believe in the despicable god Nicky Gumbel sells.\"  \"Jesus put rather well the advice that love is better than hate.\"\n\nIncidentally, I think Dawkins in in favour of the study of the history of ideas about gods. What he's against is McGrath-style self-serving \"theology\", which starts from the assumption that a particular variety of god exists, and reasons backwards to make selected texts fit it. \n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        seculardemocrat\n                    \n                        5 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nNicholas: Do you mind if I steal your contribution of 3 Nov \"It is, by the way, often possible to prove non-existence..... \"\n\n\nI would find it useful in a debate with a \"You can't prove a negative\" twit.\n\n\nAm I deluding myself but are there only about eight people who bother to debate here... and more than half of those are atheists or agnostics?\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Greywizard\n                    \n                        5 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nWell, seculardemocrat, I'm the twit! Go ahead, prove a negative! The fact that you can't prove a negative is the reason that Dawkins opts for the scaling of belief in God from absolute certainty at one end to absolute certainty not at the other end (see The God Delusion, pp. 50-51). Why do you think he calls his fourth chapter \"Why there is almost certainly no god\"? If he could have proved the negative, he'd have done so. Besides, if you want to argue with me, there's no reason to be offensive. So, argue away.\n\n\n\nThe point, if I may remind you, is this. Religious people say: 'You can't prove that God doesn't exist.\" Which is true, as Dawkins rightly observes. However, that doesn't mean that, based on what we know, it is not highly improbable that God exists. And that's really all that we need. The point, in the end, belongs to Hume. If you look at two events, and stare at them no matter how long, you will not see the cause that connects them. However, that doesn't mean that there is not, based on past experience, a high probability that one event will not follow another. This is precisely Dawkins' point, against people like Alister McGrath, who thinks that not being able to prove negative existence is equivalent with there being a 50% probability of one or the other. Not so, says Dawkins, correctly, the probability of non-existence may be near 100%. As Dawkins himself says: \"... reason alone could not propet one to total conviction that anything definitely does not exist.\" (51) Right from the Twit's mouth! Okay? Now, argue.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Greywizard\n                    \n                        5 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nSorry, 'propet' in the penultimate line of text should read 'propel'.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Paul Rodden\n                    \n                        5 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nGreyWiz, you say: \"CS Lewis has sold in the millions, and his is pretty light stuff.\" I wouldn't contest that at all.\n\n\nWhat I was contesting, was that initially, you referred to, 'The God Delusion', as a work of Philosophical Theology, which it is not - but now you say \"Dawkins was not writing an academic work, but a work addressed to ordinary people.\". So, which is it?\n\n\nSecondly, \"Not the filth of worldly passions at all - just something that comes naturally to passionate beings such as we\" - Exactly! I wouldn't contest that at all!. You'll notice I put it in quotation marks for that very reason. As you'll know from months of posts, I've been trying to get you to admit that very point, and now you have: scientists, you, and anyone else - religious or not - are no more reasonable, no more providers of evidence, no more moral, than religious people: We have a common nature. All have sinned.\n\n\nYet always, your basic claim is that your epistemological model is somehow better or more likely to reach truth than a religious one. This is simply wrong, by your own admission, now. This is 'The GreyWizard Delusion', and several of your fellows suffer from it, too, and what separates you all from posters like Scarthin Nick, Polly, etc.. You have been claiming consistently the cool-headedness of 'dispassionate' science and reason, where there isn't any such thing, if 'competing voices' are \"something that comes naturally to passionate beings such as we\", which I believe, and you have said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, this is all by-the-by in the light of what you say about the bus ad:\n\n\n\"It's directed towards ordinary people, many of whom are religious by reflex.\" RELIGIOUS BY REFLEX! Now that is a huge admission!\n\n\nWhat is a reflex? It's a bodily action where no act of the intellect or will is involved (As good ol' Wiki says, \"A reflex action, also known as a reflex, is an involuntary and nearly instantaneous movement in response to a stimulus\"). Therefore, like any other reflex, you're saying religion is written into the physical nature of our being, like blinking, sneezing, etc., and cannot be controlled at will.\n\n\nNow, if this is the case, then the Catholic teaching about Natural Law and it being 'written on our hearts' (Rom. 2:15), can no longer be contested as you've just told me (which I totally would agree, as would Augustine and Aquinas) that religion is, indeed a reflex of the created to the creator - wired into our very natures, the 'stimulus' being: GOD\n\n\nBut more to the point, with your comment about the 'competing voices' being, \"just something that comes naturally to passionate beings such as we\", original sin storms through the door, numbing or blinding that reflex: as Christianity has always taught (well, us Catholics anyway, as I can't talk for others).\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Greywizard\n                    \n                        5 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nHey, Paul, you think you can't write philosophical theology for ordinary people? Come on, it's done all the time. Richard Swinburne did it in his little book Is there a God?. So why not Richard Dawkins?\n\n\n\nWe all have a common nature. Well, probably. But, 'all have sinned'? That takes another leap. A great big one.\n\n\n\nReason and emotion go together. Read Antonio Damasio, or another other modern treatment of cognitive science/consciousness studies. That doesn't mean that there is no reason! Good Dog, man! You can't just jump from one thing to another. Without emotion people can't reason. That's fairly well established. Our emotional (passional, if you will) nature is an integral part of our rational nature. So, what's the issue?\n\n\n\nReligious by reflex is not a huge admission. You want to read too much into what's there. You'll take any carrot offered, clearly. People are largely religious by reflex, because that's the way they've been brought up to be. They've not been given the chance, by and large, to think about religion. Religion is inculcated young, before the ability to reason develops fully. So, people's responses are, as I suggested, religious by reflex. I might have said, as truly, 'religious by conditioning.' How does that suit your purposes? It doesn't play into the idea of natural law at all. It just goes to the claim that a lot of our reponses are built into us by childhood conditioning. That's what Dawkins says too. I think he's right.\n\n\n\nOh, dear me, Paul! Get your mind out of the gutter! You say: \"But more to the point, with your comment about the 'competing voices' being, \"just something that comes naturally to passionate beings such as we\", original sin storms through the door, numbing or blinding that reflex.\" Storming? Get a grip! As you will see, that's not what I had in mind at all. It's got nothing to do with original sin, which is a pure fabrication, built on a questionable theory of atonement (as theories of atonement must be), which is as questionable in its Catholic variety as it is in the 57 other varieties of Christianity.\n\n\n\nCome on, Paul, stop looking in what I say for places to climb up the steep cliff you're facing. Try to find places to put your hands and feet, all on your own.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Paul Rodden\n                    \n                        5 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \n\"Religious people say: 'You can't prove that God doesn't exist.\" Which is true, as Dawkins rightly observes.\" Yep.\n\n\nBut, if you really don't believe in something's existence, you can't have it as a concept in your consciousness at all. For, even as a concept, it has some form of existence. So all these authors, like Dawkins, Hitchens, et al, are actually increasing and propogating the concept of the divine, rather than reducing it, aren't they? So, what I am puzzled about by the advert, is that if I have an absence or privation of a concept like God, I'm not going to think about it and I'm not going to worry about it, because there's absolutely nothing there in consciousness to think or worry about - until I see the advert.\n\n\nBy this campaign, the BHA is going to increase the amount of presence of the concept, 'God', rather than reduce it, isn't it? In other words, surely it's going to get people to think and possibly worry more than less after it was brought to their attention, than they thought about if before their 'consciousness was raised'?\n\n\nTherefore, by merely mooting the concept, isn't the BHA actually bringing something into existence - thought about 'God' - that might not have been made present or existed if a person didn't see the advert? In short, isn't the advert actually a version of the old psychologists', 'Don't think of an Elephant', gag - which is bound to backfire on them? That's why, as I've tried to show in previous posts, the advert's a sort of 'double-negative'.\n\n\nIf this is the case - and  I think it is - based on the fact that if my attention is drawn to something I might think about it, where in normal everyday circustances it wouldn't cross my mind - then Theos is dead right about its potentially positive impact for Christianity and an increase in enquiries about our faith.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Paul Rodden\n                    \n                        5 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nGreyWiz, don't be so sloppy with your terms, then.\n\n\nOf course, like I've shown before, if I'm sloppy you pick me up in an exceptionally pedantic manner, if you're sloppy, you claim I should know better or I'm stupid, blah, blah...\n\n\nAnyway, I've said my final piece about the advert now, so see you next discussion.

Ideas? What are ideas? Tell me? They certainly aren't, as you seem to suppose, actual existences, 'out there' someplace. Mooting a concept, as you put it, is not bringing something into existence.

Of course it can, for example:\n\n\n2a) There is the Ontological Proof (I am working on it). If ontology was good enough for Saint Anselm in the 11th century, then why shouldn�??t it be good enough in the 21st.\n\n\n2b) Apart from Anselm, the existence of a creator-god violates the first law of thermodynamics (the law of conservation of energy) which dictates that it is just as impossible to annihilate anything, as it is to create anything (baryonic or non-baryonic) from nothing. Some might retort with the cliché that an almighty god can create or suspend any law he pleases. This is a non-starter, for no almighty god ever explained how it was possible for him (or her) to come about; and even if he or she or any number of them were self-created magically, it is impossible for any entity to create a law which destroys its own fiat. Or, to coin an analogy (yes I know analogies are never perfect): It is impossible to manufacture a bomb, cleverly designed to blow up and destroy its maker the instant it is completed, and still end up with a pile of bombs and a bomb-maker sound in life and limb.\n\n\n2c) If the notion that gods exist is based primarily on the just-so stories written in holy and infallible books, then there are numerous passages in these books which prove, without fear of contradiction, that the authors were lying in their teeth, either deliberately (for whatever reason) or through total ignorance of what today is common knowledge. Examples of such stories are: Violation of the laws of gravity and violation of the laws of motion (by a human, for god�??s sake). Violation by the same human of the law of conservation of angular momentum. A double violation of the previous law by another human! Numerous violations of physical, chemical, and basic engineering principles. It must be admitted, however, that this is not in itself proof that man-made gods do not exist, but that the men who wrote about them were insufferable liars (why is it that it is always men who tell the biggest lies?). The sick joke is that someone recognised man�??s stupidity and concluded that: �??The bigger the lie, the more will people believe it�??. The farcical joke is that we should be expected to stand in a court of law and place our hand on a book full of the most incredible whoppers, then swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth!\n\n\nWhich leads us back to the subject of this thread: To which of the 1685 man-made gods, does the slogan on the bus refer?\n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Paul Rodden\n                    \n                        6 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \n\"Apart from Anselm, the existence of a creator-god violates the first law of thermodynamics (the law of conservation of energy) which dictates that it is just as impossible to annihilate anything, as it is to create anything (baryonic or non-baryonic) from nothing.\"\n\n\nSo how come there's anything at all in the first place?\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Paul Rodden\n                    \n                        6 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nGreyWiz, you say, \"imagining something, despite your rather overstretched idea of giving something existence\" - is that my idea?

This proposition is indeed so true that its negation is inconceivable. For it is inconceivable that there is something in existence whose existence is inconceivable. Howbeit then that that thing which is inconceivable may bring forth the First Law of Thermodynamics which is conceivable, thus making the conceivable inconceivable which is utterly absurd. For the Law of Conservation of Energy is conceivable and must be greater than that which is inconceivable. Thus, you alone, O First Law of Thermodynamics, most truly of all laws whose non-existence is inconceivable do truly exist, and therefore have more the prerogative of existence above that which is inconceivable.\n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        silverspirit2001\n                    \n                        6 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nPaul: I thought you would never ask!

Chaced from the open country, these robbers fly into the forest, and lie in wait to break in upon every unguarded avenue of thee mind, and overwhelm it with religious fears and prejudices. The stoutest antagonist, if he remit his watch a moment, is oppressed. And many, through cowardice and folly, open the gates to the enemies, and willingly receive them with reverence and submission, as their legal soverigns.\"\n\n\n\n\"Accurate and just reasoning is the only catholic remedy, fitted for all persons and all dispositions; and is alone able to subvert that abstruse philosophy and metaphysical jargon, which, being mixed up with popular superstition, renders it in a manner impenetrable to careless reasoners, and gives it the air of science and wisdom.\"\n\n\n\nWell, Paul, I've read all sorts of philosophy, but I don't think I've ever been faced with such a farrago of nonsense from some who pretends to have. When you've whittled down your universe to the things that are really there, then we can begin to discuss again. Do you recall the inimitable cadence of ... 's prose? Cease and desist, then, with the 'fruitless efforts of human vanity', and then, if you still have something to say, I'll listen.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Zak Bishrey\n                    \n                        6 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nWell what can I say?

Glad we are not diametrically opposed to anything the other says, as seems to be the case with most blokes on this blog (on most blogs actually). It really is quite a depressing spectacle, and I bet they need bucketloads of Gaviscon to quell the tides of bile that must rise when they try to get some sleep at night.\n\n\n\n\n\nI can't make any sense of literalism, but in itself it doesn't lead to unpleasantness. There are many perfectly peaceful literalists around; Jehovah's Witnesses talk the most utter rubbish but they are also pacifists, and the reason they are pacifists is because they take the sermon on the mount literally. So I'm not at all sure that literalism is the main problem. I think it's more to do with defensive forms of behaviour, and religious fundamentalism is a very obvious example of this. I think it's to do with people who feel threatened banding together against the enemy, and shoring up the defenses.\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't see why someone who believes in the divinity of Christ should be dangerous. (I don't consider myself dangerous at all). It ought to lead you to accept that everyone is made in God's image, that you should love your neighbour as yourself, that you should love your enemies and do good to those who hate you, or at least to attempt this. I think it may well be more difficult in the case of Islam, but again I can see no reason per se why a Muslim and a Christian cannot respect each others differences and live together peacefully. I mean, the vast majority of my family and friends do not share my beliefs, but we get along fine.\n\n\n\n\n\nI think Dawkins is against all theology, as he believes it's a non-subject, and believes his fellows in the theology department at Oxford are in a very real sense fakes. I think it's perfectly reasonable for theologians to start with some idea of God; they would be unlikely to be drawn to the subject if they thought the very idea was vacuous. It's McGraths job is to illuminate, question and redefine the doctrines of Christianity for our time, and that may well mean ideas that commended themselves in the past will need to be reinterpreted. I actually think he does this rather well.\n\n\n\n\n\nI could go along with both your bus slogans, but I'd prefer \"Christians probably don't believe in the despicable God Dawkins says they do\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Greywizard\n                    \n                        6 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nMichael Cook, you say, with astonishing naiveté, that you \"don't see why someone who believes in the divinity of Christ should be dangerous.\" Wow!\n\n\n\nLet's do a short catalogue, shall we? The Pope believes in the divinity of Christ, but he supports a moral regime in which it is wrong to use artificial means of birth control, in which condoms are forbidden, leaving women without protection against STDs. The former pope's advisor on the family said that there were things worth more than life itself, and if a husband could not remain continent, then it would be better for him to infect his wife with AIDS than to use a condom!\n\n\n\nThere are still lots of Christians, who believe in the divinity of Christ, who think of Jews as Christ killers, and worth no more than than a bullet or some gas.\n\n\n\nThere are lots of Christians who believe in the divnity of Christ who reject gay and lesbian people, despite the very nature they are born with, as seriously defective, and, if they engage in same-sex sexual relationship, as being morally depraved. This attitude has led to the recent idiocies in California and Florida, and the exclusion from human community of those who happen be be gay. It also encourages rejection of gay people from ordinary life, as well as licenses harm done to gays by homophobic people.\n\n\n\nThere are a good number of Christians, who believe in the divinity of Christ, who are quite prepared to precipitate conflict in the Middle East, indeed, to precipitate a conflagration there, in the deluded expectation that it will bring the second coming of Christ even closer.\n\n\n\nThere are hundreds of thousands of Christians, who believe in the divinity of Christ, who think that the world was created 6-10,000 years ago, who disallow the teaching of evolution to their children, with the consequence that many people who might have known more about disease and the causes and cures of disease will not know, and will rely on prayer instead, with the consequences that can be seen throughout the United States, where children have died for want of some insulin, or some simply remedy.\n\n\n\nThere are many Christians who believe in the divinity of Christ, who believe that the way to solve mental problems is to beat the devil out of people, or to practice exorcism instead of medicine, with the consequent threat to the health and welfare of those who suffer from well-known psychological dysfunction.\n\n\n\nThere are millions of Christians, who believe in the divinity of Christ, who, without pity, will let people die in pain rather than to provide them with relief in their suffering and a hastening of the approaching day of their death. Countless people suffer as they die precisely because some people believe in the divinity of Christ.\n\n\n\nCountless Christians believe in the god that Dawkins says they do. Indeed, there is a very high probability that Christians believe in the god that Dawkins shows very probably does not exist, and countless people suffer as a consequence.\n\n\n\nOf course, Jehovah's Witnesses, who share some of these views, do not, so far as I know, believe in the divinity of Christ. They just wait for God to bring his judgement on all the rest for their perfidy in not believing in the idiocies they share. It's not that they are not dangerous, even though they are pacifists. They firmly believe that horrendous harm will be done to practically everyone, when Jehovah comes to judge the world. At least they're ready to wait till then, better than folks, like most Christians, who are not entirely averse to some judgement now.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Paul Rodden\n                    \n                        6 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nGreyWiz, seeing the latest post you've written has reminded me why it's not worth posting in here.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        silverspirit2001\n                    \n                        6 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nQuote\n\n\n\n\n\nWell what can I say?

It's very probably that there is no god. So, relax, and enjoy life.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Benjamin Ciaccio\n                    \n                        7 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nNovelist Elie Wiesel said, \"The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference.\"  His perspective is unique and a good one concerning this issue.  He made this comment as a Jew who endured the sufferings of the Nazi concentration camps in WWII.  \n\n\n\n\n\nElie Wiesel also said, \"I swore never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation.  We must always take sides.  Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim.  Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.\"\n\n\nAs a survivor of extreme prejudice who was tormented himself Elie Wiesel would acknowledge the evils and violence of abortion.  He would see through the lies of people like Greywizard that calls it \"reproductive choice\" when the choice was made when a person has sex.  He refuses to accept that with true freedom comes responsibility for one's actions.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople like Greywizard and Zak come on this religious website not to actually contribute anything meaningful but to \"torment\" the people who believe in God.  After exposing Greywizard for the immature and uncivilized person he is, it gave him a truth for him to reflect upon.  He took a day off after I chastized him for \"tormenting\" the good people on here.  Of course, I knew his bad habits would bring him back to his addiction.  The nice thing is, he exposes himself and Zak for what they are, \"tormentors\" of those people who believe in God.  As Jesus Christ said, \"Rejoice\" when you are persecuted by people like this.  At least they've chosen a side which is better than those who have not.  Yes, that was a compliment!\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Zak Bishrey\n                    \n                        7 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nNumber: I have no quarrel with you except that you seem to jump to unwarranted conclusions about me, about Hoyle, and about Narlikar. Nevertheless I will indulge you one more time. When, a long time ago I read about Hoyle�??s elegant steady state theory, it troubled me because it seems to require setting aside the first law of thermodynamics and left the question of a creator hanging in the air. In my humble opinion, no serious argument can proceed if a creator-god is required, if only because starting the process in the middle simply sweeps the problem of the beginning under the carpet. A cop out.\n\n\nThen came the bag bang theory which troubled me even more than the steady state model, not only because it requires a creator, and the negation of all established physical laws, but it is also impossible to see exactly what it was that banged. For if the stuff of the universe was baryonic confined in a singularity, then it could not have banged for obvious reasons. But if the stuff of the universe before the bang was non-baryonic then it would have required an external force (a god) to confine it in a tiny space in the first instance, and then for this or a rival god to pull the trigger and release the stuff into a mushrooming universe. In either case there is a need to pretend that the physical laws never existed at one time or another, and a necessity for a magician to produce a rabbit out of a hat. A cop out.\n\n\nI have read heaps of literature produced by the supporters and detractors of the steady state and the big bang, and find (in my humble opinion) that both camps are barking up the wrong tree. My model does not require a creator, nor a bang, nor any variable constants, nor setting aside any established physical laws, nor the creation of time, nor the endless fiddling with the background temperature of outer space to suit the endless morphing of the big bang model. My model satisfies Hubble�??s expansion of the universe without the need for a bang, and it is based partly on Planck�??s four constants and, crucially, on the contention that the sum of all the vectors of existence of any stuff in the universe, whether baryonic or non-baryonic, must be zero. If this treads on any god�??s tail then tough.\n\n\nTo return to the bus: If the universe came about either through a big bang or a steady state creation, both of which require a creator god, then the slogan on the bus is misleading. If the universe came about (and is still coming about) without the need for a god, then there is no need for the �??probably�?? in the slogan. From which you may conclude that I will not be contributing a penny to the project, despite the fact that it is supported by my great hero (in biology) professor Dawkins.\n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Nicholas\n                    \n                        7 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nMichael C.I think Greywizard is right that there are people who believe in the divinity of Jesus who are dangerous. But I take you to mean that believing in the divinity of Jesus does not necessarily make you dangerous. If so, I agree with you.\n\nIncidentally, I personally find the 'image of god' idea both very odd, and inherently dangerous. It seems to lead many humans to believe that humans are superior to other life-forms, and entitled to cruelly exploit them. I eat meat and love cheese, but I thought Dawkins was right, in his valedictory lecture, to draw attention to humans' cruelty in creating domestic cattle. And don't get me started on blasting fruitless fig trees! But that's straying too far from buses.\n\nThe general view in this thread seems to be that slogans about god(s) on buses won't benefit anyone much. I quite like your suggested \"Christians probably don't believe in the despicable God Dawkins says they do\". I don't however see the need to give yet more publicity to The God Delusion. (Richard Robinson's An Atheist's Values, OUP 1964, in my opinion skewered Roman so-called catholicism far more effectively.) And Dawkins did, briefly, discuss the Einsteinian 'mystery of the lawful universe'-type god, and the 'acceptable face of Y_HW_H' espoused by you and, for example, Dawkins's friend Richard Harries.\n\nSo how about 'Most Christians don't believe that a loving god would send anyone to hell'? Or 'YHWH isn't as totally obsessed by sex as some priests would have you believe'?\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Zak Bishrey\n                    \n                        7 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nBenjamin:\n\n\n1) You used 267 words in your posting without touching in any way whatsoever on the subject of this thread; instead, you had the audacity to accuse others of �??not contributing anything meaningful�???

I don't really believe that you could possibly think I'm so naive that I've failed to notice that unpleasant things have been done in the name of Christ. But it is a mark of many of these atheist vs theist blogs that, rather than asking someone to elaborate or clarify something they've said, people extrapolate all kinds of things which it's highly unlikely they meant to say, from some fairly general remark, which allows then to go off on one. (This is also one of the signs of clinical depression.)\n\n\n\n\n\nBut maybe in one sense you are right to call me naive. I am naive enough to think that someone who claims to believe in the divinity of Christ is also bound to accept his teaching, some of the most distinctive and central of which are things like 'Love your neighbour as yourself', 'love your enemies', 'do good to those who hate you' etc. Your catalogue is indeed a shameful list, and I think both you and I have every right to be extremely angry about these things, but I see no particular connection between any of these things and the belief that Jesus is divine (and therefore that the things he said are true). One can only become involved in such things by closing our ears to his words, and in order to explain the fact that professing Christians have done these things requires something rather more than their accepting Jesus as God incarnate. I do think that some religious doctrines can be, in themselves, harmful; as I said previously, I think the idea that non-christians are going to eternal torment is repulsive and dangerous. I don't think the same can be said for the incarnation.\n\n\n\n\n\nTake for example what would seem to be your strongest case, the exorcisms of people with mental problems. I say this is your strongest case because Jesus was himself an exorcist and healer, and expected his followers to do the same, whereas most of your examples involve issues on which Jesus was either silent (homosexuality, euthanasia, the teaching of evolution, birth control) or positively against (persecuting and killing Jewish people, taking up arms in order to bring about the kingdom of God). It seems to me that exorcisms that turn into the kind of abuse you describe only require there to be a general belief in spirits (which is pretty universal), a good dose of fear, and someone who wants power, which is why they have taken place in many other contexts besides the christian one. It doesn't even need the lack of good medicine, as there have been cases in this country. Plenty of abuse goes on in completely non-religious settings, perpetrated by people with no religious beliefs, and this is the point I'm trying to make, that the causes of these things have very little to do with religious doctrines, and a lot to do with fear, power and unconscious needs and urges to which we are all prone. I mean, I'm sure it hasn't escaped your notice that as soon as atheists grouped together and got some power the first thing they do is start chopping off priests heads. It would be crude of me to make some simple equation between the Revolutionists atheism and their brutality; it would be nice if you could extend the same kind of nuance you would use to explain their behaviour to religious people, because, really, we're all in this together.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the end of my first, and I think, last God blog. I can't say I've really enjoyed the experience. I don't get the feeling that anyone on here has really learnt anything from anyone else. There is a great deal of muscle-flexing going on in these pages, and its not the kind that gets any work done. It's not even the kind that's fun, like arm-wrestling. It's the kind that's well-oiled, pumped up with steroids, and spends far too long looking in the mirror.\n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        seculardemocrat\n                    \n                        7 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nGreywizard: I was not referring to you as a \"twit\" but to some other twit.

Would you like to provide a definition of God? \n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Greywizard\n                    \n                        7 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nSorry, Michael, I certainly didn't mean to be peremptorily dismissive. Nor did I mean to flex muscle, as though the only point about this is to score points.\n\n\n\nThe divinity of Jesus underwrites, not only moral and other views that derive directly from him, but also things that are said under his name and given his authority. And people have been doing this from the beginning. Of course, antisemitism is one of them, since Jesus is said to have said, of his brother Jews, that they are of their father the devil, because they did not believe what he (that is, Jesus) said. The point is not whether or not he said it, but whether or not this governs what a lot of people who believe in Jesus (and his divinity) believe or have believed. The catalogue of offences against humanity that I listed was just a small list of the kinds of things that followers of Jesus do, have done, and are doing, in Jesus' name.\n\n\n\nDo abuses of people go on in non-religious settings? Unquestionably. Arguably though, so long as those settings are not underwritten by an absolute ideology - and religions almost inevitably run in this direction - there are always self-correcting mechanisms. I used to think that the church had internal self-correcting mechanisms too, and there were signs of a liberalisation and contextualisation of Christian moral beliefs. In the event, this turned out to be so only for a very few, because the church seeems alway to revert to type. This is what canonical books do to people. They short circuit what they would otherwise think or believe. (Possibly there are positive changes, though I find them hard to see sometimes, but it may be like the frog getting out of the well, up 2 feet, down 1, and so on.)\n\n\n\nBut my point is not to make a crude identification between Christians and the harm that Christians do. It is, however, my experience that Christians cannot let go of some of the most horrible of their commitments that do harm to people, even though, with another part of themselves, Christians do, have done and will continue to do much good. All I wanted to point out that much harm has been done in Jesus' name, by those who believe that Jesus is a god. And so I said it. I have seen Christians do harm, and I think it is important that we bear in mind that any ideology, atheistic or religious, that refuses to allow exceptions to its rules, or reasonable criticism of its rules, no matter how defined, is almost inevitably harmful.\n\n\n\nWhat so often sets our minds at ease are the religious leaders who get up and purport to be moral leaders. They are not. They have command systems of morality, and they apply them like sledgehammers, despite what a few of their more liberal colleagues say. Never trust a true believer. Jesus was one.\n\n\n\nBy the way, despite the fact that I come out of chute all raring to go, doesn't mean that I don't want to find the truth. I've found, from long experience here, that if you don't come out swinging, real issues don't get addressed at all. However, if you want to have a gentle discussion about this, by all means, let us do so, and put away the gloves and the martial arts demeanour.\n\n\n\nWell, seculardemocrat, I can be a twit, and will wear the cap when it fits. No, I don't want to provide a definition of the word 'god'. I don't think it can be done in any definitive sense, and, in any event, the entity so described would certainly not be the one believed in by believers in a god. It's always not that one that they believe in. That's why Christians make such heavy weather of Dawkins' book. All they need to say, as Terry Eagleton did say, is that Dawkins hasn't studied Ockham or Dun Scotus, so obviously what he says can't apply to the god of Christians!\n\n\n\nOf course, the point still is that you really can't prove a negative, no matter how you define god. It might, for all you know, turn up tomorrow. What you can do, by way of 'proving' a negative, is to make the existence of the thing negated look highly unlikely. And that's usually just as useful. Hence the useful bus ad.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        seculardemocrat\n                    \n                        7 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nSo that was a short debate. True you can't prove X does not exist if X is not defined. I I would suggest that it might be difficult to prove X does exist in the same circumstances. \n\n\nYou see the religious have been getting away with not defining God or changing the definition when embarrasing evidence appears since H.Sapiens could first talk. So we should always press for a definition, write it down and hold them to it. Problem is there are so many brands available in the religion industry, that could be quite hard work.\n\n\nPerhaps we should give up on all this meta-physics and meta-mathematics stuff and concentrate on the real issues. The public donated £117,546 (as of 3pm today) of their hard earned cash at the just giving web site because they are sick of public transport being covered in the advertising of the religion industry. They have given £12,417 in a couple of weeks to campaign against sectarian (aka Faith) schools. Take a look at\n\n\njustgiving/faithschools and read the comments.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Greywizard\n                    \n                        7 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nNo, seculardemocrat, you've got in backwards. However you define X, it is still impossible to prove -X. Of course, the more precisely you try to define 'God', the more easily the believer can wiggle out of your attempt to show that God, so defined, probably does not exist. But that doesn't make God's existence, however, defined, more probable.\n\n\nThe problem for the religious believer is to adopt a definition of 'God', and then stick to it, because someone is sure to pick on some aspect of the definition, and raise questions about it. The best way, if you're a believer, is always to hold conditional definitions that you can retreat from when difficulty arises.\n\n\n\nApparently, religious believers think that this is always possible, but as the gaps got filled in believers came to realise that that method didn't really work either. So, what's the response to this problem? Well, redefine what you meaning by belief in God, and let the whole idea of God shift and change with the changing articulations of belief. God is whatever is believed in when believers say that they believe. God as the subject matter of theology. That's why Terry Eagleton could fault Dawkins for not having read a couple rather marginal (at least to our thought today) medieval theologians. If you haven't read Dun Scotus, then you really can understand what we mean when we are talking about God.\n\n\n\nIt's a dead easy strategy, and is very reminiscent of guerilla tactics in warfare. Every time soldiers go out in the field they have to redefine what the enemy is. It's an attractive strategy for believers, because they can never be nailed down to a particular belief or set of beliefs. Talk about resurrection can become (although Rowan Williams says that he really does mean that there was an empty tomb) talk about the idea of 'new life', however understood. There is a resurrection in the spring. Some people have a resurrection, a 'new lease on life' when they get a new job, or move to a new city, or meet the love of their life. In this way religion becomes a moving target, that doesn't always look like a target.\n\n\n\nI guess what the bus ads say to me, and what they are useful for, is that religious believers do, in the end, make claims, and they have to justify those claims. They can't simply take them for granted. Precisely why faith schools should be challenged. Faith in what, precisely? Well...., and here there's a lot of hemming and hawing, and remarks to the effect that you can't understand religion that way.\n\n\n\nBut when it comes to to brass tacks, religions know exactly what they mean. It means women in second place; it means no abortions, ever; it means only certain sexual acts; it means to assistance with dying; it means no divorce; it means...., well, you get the picture. And it's the moving target and definite conclusions that really concern me. If they have beliefs, let them tell us. If they can't tell us, how did they arrive at these definite moral conclusions? Where is it all written so clearly? And why should we take it as written?\n\n\n\nSo: \"There's probably no god; now relax ...\", makes good sense.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Paul Rodden\n                    \n                        7 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nHi Michael Cook.

The most amusing aspect of it all is that he and Zak are the best refutations of their own position.\n\n\nIn short, you can see that in every post, they fail to observe their own criteria of what constitutes objective reason and evidence, QED.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Greywizard\n                    \n                        7 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nPaul, first, in your nice little note to Michael Cook, where you suggest that Zak and I \"are the best refutations of their own position,\" (well, Zak can obviously take care of himself), what do you mean by (and I put this in the singular) 'his [my] own position'? I have taken many positions for some time. Do I only have one? Can you name it please? And then, if you can, would you like to respond? Second, what do you think I mean by 'objective reason and evidence'? You see, the point is that I've been saying things (as I did about those who believe in Jesus' divinity and are dangerous), and you've never really shown that I am wrong. All you say is something (as you did say in your last post but one) that what I posted shows how useless it was to post anything on this blog. But you never really argue with me, you never respond to me.\n\n\n\nSo, let's try this again. I said several things, but we'll keep it to two or three. There are large numbers of people who believe in the divinity of Jesus (or Christ, take your pick), who, because of their belief in Jesus' divinity, and the moral system that is erected on the basis of that belief, go on to do harm to people: (i) they forbid (or discourage where they cannot forbid) the use of condoms. As a result women (and presumably men) are more likely to contract STDs, some of which are fatal. (ii) they forbid (or discourage where they cannot forbid) the provision of abortion (even where they forbid the use of contraceptives - figure that out if you can!), leading to severe distress to some women or girls who are forced to bring children to birth at the expense of their own lives, health, or life projects. (iii) they forbid (or discourage where they cannot forbid) the provision of help in dying, forcing people to undergo untold suffering for beliefs they do not hold. They even team up with Muslims who agree with them on this point only, in forbidding these things.\n\n\n\nNow, show that that is false. I believe, and I have stated, that many Christians hold beliefs which do much harm, and are therefore dangerous. I believe that, regardless of what Christians (of whatever stripe) think about the rightness or wrongness of their moral beliefs, they have no right to impose those beliefs on others who do not share them. I think this means that many Christians are quite prepared to do harm to others based simply on their beliefs of what is right and wrong. I do not think that Christians have privileged access to the truth of their moral beliefs, and in fact I think it is obvious in many cases that their beliefs are manifestly false, and deeply offensive to morality. I don't want to be governed by someone else's moral beliefs, where those beliefs concern the doing of things which do not harm the lives, properties or other benefits that those believers enjoy. I think therefore that they should commend their beliefs to others, and, where they fail to find agreement, hold their beliefs in private and let others get on with their lives. That's why I think atheist buses just might be of great service to other people, and help to put an end to this unwelcome intrusive presence of Christians in the lives of others.\n\n\n\nNow, whatever you think I have said about objective reason and evidence, I think there is nothing in what I have just said that fails in either reason, objectivity, or (for any reasonable person) evidence. However, I am willing to listen to what you have to say in rebuttal - not just in irrelevant comment on my person or my character, just, simple, ordinary, rebuttal. So far, Paul, I have heard nothing from you in months of posting that even comes near to that qualification. So, give it try, why don't you?\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Zak Bishrey\n                    \n                        8 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nPaul: You are boot-strapping again. Keep pulling and who knows, one day your rant may take off, in your dreams.\n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Nicholas\n                    \n                        8 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nI still think that non-existence can sometimes be proved. I'd like the buses to say \"There aren't any benevolent omnipotent entities.\"\n\nIntegers are part of every day experience. As I said before, there is proof that there is no pair of integers such that the square of one is exactly double the square of the other. (7 and 5 are a near miss: 49 is nearly double 25.) There is proof that Sherlock Holmes did not exist: his invention, as a fictional character, is documented. Amusingly, given that Conan Doyle was taken in by faked photographs of fairies, it would likewise (in principle although, I agree, not in practice) be possible to trace each tale of fairies or unicorns or mermaids to its inventor or faker, and thus show that there are no fairies at the bottom of my garden, or anywhere else. If it is asserted that there is an actual teapot in a stated orbit around the sun, it is in principle possible to send a probe to show that it isn't there. The trouble comes, as Russell pointed out, when the teapot is thereupon said to be invisible. And it gets worse when the teapot was once cracked, but is now whole, and forgives sins, and children are schooled to sing hymns to it which have damned good tunes.\n\nSadly, even though Joseph Smith's brazen invention of a new god is well documented, millions of people were and still are fooled by it.\n\nOnce upon a time, the last of the dinosaurs suffered as they watched their children starve to death in the face of we know not what calamity. That fact, and countless similar miseries, prove that there are no benevolent omnipotent entities. The writer(s) of Job knew that, and described a malevolent, prodigiously powerful (but less than omnipotent) god.\n\nOf course I know that there are books, too many books, and all too long, which attempt to devise so-called theodicies that will open a crack for a benevolent omnipotent entity to creep in. They all fail, because they all postulate either a less than omnipotent entity, or a malevolent entity which can't distinguish between bearable formative suffering and unbearable destructive pain.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Michael Cook\n                    \n                        8 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nNicholas. I owe you an answer, if only for being one of the few people in this discussion who doesn't seem overly defensive, or to have some kind of pathological need to be right all the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't share your discomfort with the idea that we're made in the image of God. It seems obvious to me that humans are very special creatures, and if there is a God it would seem to make sense that we are able to relate to God in ways that, say, a ferret, can't. And with that comes enormous responsibility towards the rest of the creation, and especially towards other living things. Again, I don't think there's anything particularly religious about the exploitation of animals, and it does seem a little rich for someone like Dawkins, who belongs to a profession heavily involved in vivisection (done for the highest motives of course) to lecture us about breeding cattle. But I think your instinct is right; any real God must care about all of creation, not just the human bit. Saint Francis certainly thought so.\n\n\n\n\n\nI also agree that the bus, as it is, won't benefit anyone very much. I don't see why a better campaign couldn't be done though. It seems to be generally agreed that the current slogan is astonishingly weak, and as someone that used to work in advertising graphics I could've come up with several much better suggestions - if only they'd asked me! I think they need a slogan that asks people to actually do something, such as support a particular campaign, or join the National Secular Society or the British Humanist Association. It's a shame (not to mention rather ironic) that 'We believe in life before death' is already taken by Christian Aid, as this would've been ideal.\n\n\n\n\n\nI could go with your second slogan, but not your first. I think most christians do believe in some kind of hell, for some kinds of people; it is after all quite hard to imagine Dr Mengele sharing quality time with his 'patients'. But maybe this is a failure of the imagination as much as anything. It's just my experience, from reading and talking to people, that most do not accept the idea of 'No salvation outside the church', or if they do, they redefine 'church' in a way that casts the net rather wide. One of the things the idea of the incarnation says to me is that God is a God who will go to any lengths to bring back those that are lost, and there is all of eternity in which to do it.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Greywizard\n                    \n                        8 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nRecently, a little girl, only 13 years old, was taken into a stadium, surrounded by throngs of chanting men, she was buried up to her neck, and then a truck load of stones was brought, and the men proceeded to stone the little girl to death. As she was being dragged, protesting, \"Don't kill me, don't kill me!\" into the stadium, some men wanted to rescue her, but were warned by armed militia members not to try. So, Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow, only 13 years old, was stoned to death. At one point she was pulled out and checked by nurses to see if she was still alive. When they determined she was, they buried her again, and the assulat continued, stones thrown at her little head until she was dead.\n\n\n\nWhy do I bring up this tragic event? Simply because this little girl, who had been raped by three men, and who had gone with her fathers to the authorities to report her rape, was taken into custody by the Islamist militia controlling that part of Somalia, and she was killed for adultery, as Islam commands.\n\n\n\nBut no one here is recommending such outrageous things, are they? Yes, they are, in my view, because they are not willing to look, not only at the violent history of religion, but the violence that lies hidden within religious texts. Michael Cook doesn't feel uncomfortable with \"the idea that we're made in the image of God,\" and clearly not with the idea that this god has come to us in human form. And, clearly, neither Islam not belief in the incarnation implies the vicious killing of little girls. Of course not, yet these ideas, the idea of incarnation, the idea of God's final prophecy in the Koran, cannot be divorced from what has been done in their name, because the violence that is done is implicit within the texts that are held holy by Muslims and Christians, and they have no control over how those texts will be read and applied.\n\n\n\nMichael Cook has said this in response to my earlier post (and then, in this one, has remarked on those who, on these blogs, have a pathological need to be right): \"I am naive enough to think that someone who claims to believe in the divinity of Christ is also bound to accept his teaching, some of the most distinctive and central of which are things like 'Love your neighbour as yourself', 'love your enemies', 'do good to those who hate you' etc.\"\n\n\n\nFirst of all, let me point out, that 'love your neighbours as yourself' comes from Leviticus, so it is not distinctive to Jesus. Loving your enemies may be, but it's not clear that it makes any sense. And setting out to be good to those who hate you has no clear context, so it is not obvious what it means. It probably doesn't come from Jesus, but from later Christians, who realised that brute power (which they could not wield) would not commend them to their opponents, and who tried a form of pacifism instead. It was remarkably successful, since it is hard, as Gandhi knew, to keep killing those who simply present themselves to be killed. You have to have a very special kind of lawless brutality to be able to do that, and most Romans, as the letter of Pliny to Trajian testifies, were really not up to that. And Roman persecutions were, after all, not very persistent, and very erratic. There were times when Christians, intent on dying for the faith, even threatened with death those who refused to kill them for their faith, so zealous had the hunger for martyrdom become.\n\n\n\nBut the real point to make is that Jesus' teachings, for all that they contained some fine principles, such as the Jewish 'love your neighbours as yourselves', also included some astonishingly brutal judgements. We may recall his outrageous judgement on Chorazim and Bethsaida, for failing in belief. Then, of course, there is the famous story of the Master welcoming his servants, who had given shelter to the homeless, clothing to the naked, water to the thirsty, which also includes the horrible condemnation to eternal fire for those who had not done so. The gospel of John includes the dismissal of the Jewish people as children of the devil, a judgement that has done enormous harm over the centuries. Paul's gospel, preached to the Galatians, imposes condemnation, in the name of the Christ he serves, on all those who falsely preach that the Jewish law is binding on those who would follow Christ - signs of an early division amongst followers of Christ, which led to so much violence that the suffering is almost incalculable.\n\n\n\nMy point is simply this. Christians have no right to claim the fortunate kingdom, ruled by a non-violent Christ, since the Christ of the scriptures and the Christ of history, was and still is characterised by violent judgement and condemnation.\n\n\n\nThis violence is written deeply in Christian, Jewish and Muslim texts. If Christians, Jews and Muslims continue the charade of believing that the heart of their religions is all peace and love, then these violent parts of faith will remain unaddressed. As Nelson-Pallmayer says in his book, Is Religion Killing Us?, \"Jews, Christians and Muslims must address the problem of violence and 'sacred' text if we are to have any reasonable hope for an alternative future.\" (108)\n\n\n\nAttending to the discussion so far, I am not confident that Christians, anyway, are prepared to address this issue. When I point to the violence embedded in the text, I am fobbed off with the absurd notion that I have some patholical need to right. My pathological need, so far as it goes, is to hear some acknowledgement from Christians, and other religionists, that there are indeed problems here, that the problem of violence is still deeply rooted in religious traditions, and needs to be addressed, not simply dismissed with casual references to naiveté. I am not accusing anyone of naiveté. I am accusing Christianity (to go no further) of being blind to the violent possibilities that lie buried, half hidden, in its tradition. Unless Christians are willing to address these things, and Muslims and Jews and members of other religions as well, the appearance of insistent religious voices on the public scene is not encouraging, and, I daresay, will lead to the violence that seems to go all but unnoticed in religious traditions.\n\n\n\nI will go further. I think that each of you, who retains a fundamental allegiance to your religious tradition, without addressing these problems of violence, is responsible for that little girl's death. She died because religious people are not prepared to look more closely at the dangers of their traditions. It is still ongoing. She is not the only one to die as a result of this pathological blindness. And anyone who points out that there are alternatives to this madness should be heard.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Michael Cook\n                    \n                        9 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nGreywizard.\n\n\nIt seems to me that exorcisms that turn into the kind of abuse you describe only require there to be a general belief in spirits (which is pretty universal), a good dose of fear, and someone who wants power, which is why they have taken place in many other contexts besides the christian one. It doesn't even need the lack of good medicine, as there have been cases in this country. Plenty of abuse goes on in completely non-religious settings, perpetrated by people with no religious beliefs, and this is the point I'm trying to make, that the causes of these things have very little to do with religious doctrines, and a lot to do with fear, power and unconscious needs and urges to which we are all prone. I mean, I'm sure it hasn't escaped your notice that as soon as atheists grouped together and got some power the first thing they do is start chopping off priests heads. It would be crude of me to make some simple equation between the Revolutionists atheism and their brutality; it would be nice if you could extend the same kind of nuance you would use to explain their behaviour to religious people, because, really, we're all in this together.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above was my no doubt rather inadequate outline of how irrational violence comes to be. I think it was necessarily vague because the ways in which humans come to harm one another are myriad and driven by needs and drives which are actually quite hard for us to fathom, and which precede and transcend texts of any kind. I fully agree that Christians need to face head-on the violence that erupts in religious contexts, and I for one hope the work of Rene Girard has the most enormous influence on Christianity, as it deserves to, and it might even help some non-believers understand why their own high ideals have slipped so easily into violence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Greywizard\n                    \n                        9 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nYou mistake me, Michael Cook. I do not have patience with atheists who do horrible things to people in the name of atheism. Indeed, in their case, it is perhaps less forgiveable. Unfortunately, many atheist 'utopias' of the last hundred years were based on what became, for them, holy texts. My problem is not that Christians do wrong, though that is problem enough, nor that Muslims do horrible blood-curdling things. My problem is that these things are done in the name of beliefs based on texts which have the added virtue of infallibility. Atheist texts, like Marx's or Mao's, have a track record which is not much better than that of the texts used by Christiams, Muslims, and, now that they have a place of their own, Jews. Atheist systems, unilke Christian and other religious systems,do not have an inherent need of a text or other absolute authority. They might have been different, because they might have been built on critical reason. Unfortunately, though some Christians have tried very hard to be critical, they have left their texts alone. At the same time that someone like Bishop Spong turns the scriptures upside down, and concludes that they do not mean what Christians believe they do, he still leaves the scriptures in place as a protected work, and protected works like the Bible have ways of unaccountably breaking out in proxsysms of organismic violence. They have a way of intruding themselves into the public conversation in ways that are simply dangerous, and are to be avoided at all costs.\n\n\n\nChristians are free to indulge their beliefs, if they wish. Religions may, perhaps, even enhance the lives of practioners, but when religion begins to spill over, as  religion, into political contexts, then we have trouble, because religions still refuse to deal with the danger of sacred text. I suspect that this cannot be done, and that religions will always be a danger to women, gay and lesbian person, children and others, who, for historical reasons, stand outside the normative society constructed by most religious texts. I am reminded here of something that President elect Obama said in an address back in 2006. After talking about the important place of religion in people's lives, he goes on in this vein.\n\n\n\n\n\"Democracy demands that the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal, rather than religion-specific, values. It requires that their proposals be subject to argument, and amenable to reason. I may be opposed to abortion for religious reasons, but if I seek to pass a law banning the practice, I cannot simply point to the teachings of my church or evoke God's will. I have to explain why abortion violates some principle that is accessible to people of all faiths, including those with no faith at all.\"\n\n\n\nThat, it seems to me is very important, and well said. Nor do I think that René Girard's ideas about the way ritual sacrifice functions as a kind of cathartic ritual for real social violence will do the trick here. I'm not even convinced that Girard's theory is right, though it has been given a lot of mileage in the last decade or two. Religions, it seems to me, need to stop pretending that violence sourced in religion can help spilling over into the public realm. There have been too many children who have died in the US, for example, for want of simple medical procedures, to make even a modest restrictions of religious violence to the private sphere enough. Religions need to begin acknowledging the violence which lies at the heart of religious texts. It's a problem that needs to be faced. And then they need to demote the texts themselves as sources of ultimate authority. Everyone I talk to thinks of Christianity as a religion of peace and love. Okay, let it be that, and let it take the texts in the New Testament that preach hatred of those who differ in belief and condemn heretics to hellfire, and say that they no longer have, or should be considered to have, divine authority. They should not have to be explained away; they should simply be expurgated. Christianity must take the texts that derogate from dignity of women and do likewise, and so for other religions. When they have done that, shorn their texts of authoritative violence, then perhaps they can say with some show of reason that they can be powers for good within society. But until they have done that, they remain dangers, suffused with violence that will break out, with unexpected fury from time to time; and society will continue to suffer from kinds of violence that religious people say, with some show of reason, that they do not themselves endorse, and yet retain unmonitored in their texts, awaiting the next champion who believes he has suddenly found the truth of faith that his fellow believers have missed or have been unfaithful to all these years.\n\n\n\nThe blood of Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow cries out from the ground, and more blood will be spilt, unless religious people acknowledge the violence that lurks at the heart of their religious texts.\n\n\n\nOf course, what I say refers not only to religious texts or religious contexts. I am far away from thinking that only religion is to be blame. Any absolute ideology is the same. Any ideology that cannot take individuals and their good into consideration is exactly the same, and there have been enough atheist ideologies to make it clear that it is not religion itself that need be at fault. It just usally is, in the world that we know. But religion could, if it wished, be a purely benign force in the world. It could translate its message into one of peace, respect for persons, and a dedication to those who need help. It could funnel billions of pounds or dollars into doing these things, instead of wasting it on buildings erected to worship a God that is worshipped too much in hatred and separation. For what has God to do with rivers of oil, or cases of wine, or the fat of rams? What does God require of you but to do justly and love mercy and walk humbly with God? The blood of Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow and her sisters and brothers cries out from the ground.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Paul Rodden\n                    \n                        9 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \n\"Atheist systems, unilke Christian and other religious systems,do not have an inherent need of a text or other absolute authority.\"\n\n\n- But I would suggest that 'The God Delusion', and 'God is not Great', have the potential to become such 'texts' and absolute authority, too.\n\n\nMaoism, Marxism, National Socialism, etc., started off small. In fact, they started with one person who wrote a text.\n\n\nIt seems common sense to me, the more authors a text has over a larger timescale, increases the chances of it's objectivity, and reduces the chances of it being subjective and relative (not unlike scientific method), than the sort of single author/brief timescale model we have seen over the past 100 years of genocidal maniacs. We must not forget that Acts formulated by governments and legislatures are texts, too.\n\n\nWithout texts, all you can say with certainty about any form of atheist thinking or state of affairs, and it's supposed benevolence and/or innocuousness is, 'Currently...'. For, at any moment, dependent upon the synchronicity of certain circumstances, anything horrific could be unleashed, without text, rhyme, or reason.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Greywizard\n                    \n                        9 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nYou know, Paul, I wish you weren't so easy to demolish.

I have to accept what anyone who claims to be an atheist or a humanist says!? Why? Why do I have to accept such an absurd conclusion? Because, you have to accept whatever next issues from the Vatican!!!! This isn't the way it works. You say something, I say something, and so the argument carries on. You can't simply say that the next thing I accept is whatever anyone will say. You have to respond to me, then I will respond to you. Failing that, you may as well go on drinking swill from the next one you acknowledge as an authority. The pope, maybe? You choose. But don't put words into my mouth.

You really don't know why?! Good heavens, Paul! I think you really are challenged by Micah's prophetic appeal!\n\n\n\nWhy is Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow's blood on your conscience? For the simple reason that Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow's blood was shed because of a text. A text that someone read as demanding her blood. And you, you appeal too, to texts, texts which define, texts which condemn. How do I know this? Because you said:\n\n\n\n\"Without texts, all you can say with certainty about any form of atheist thinking or state of affairs, and it's supposed benevolence and/or innocuousness is, 'Currently...'.\"\n\n\n\nBecause you only know texts. As soon as you answer with something other than texts, I'll really know that you're really alive, and not just a cipher for Cardinal Razinger! It's hard to tell the difference, when you don't know who is speaking, you or your double! So, don't just ask questions, try to speak on your own. Really, it gets easier as you go!\n\n\n\nRegarding my view of culpability? That's easy. Anyone who can't give an alibi. And, so far, you haven't!\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Paul Rodden\n                    \n                        10 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nIf I was a Bible-alone Christian, what you say might be relevant. But, I am not. Even so, to make a link at such a distance, is what I can't get my head round. Particularly because I'm not a Muslim, either.\n\n\nAnyway, you quote me, \"Without texts, all you can say with certainty about any form of atheist thinking or state of affairs, and it's supposed benevolence and/or innocuousness is, 'Currently...'.\". Show me how truth or law can be stable within a social environment where there are no texts. I think your claims for the integrity of atheism as capable of being coherent without texts, are dangerously overstated.\n\n\nOne of the main reasons I am a Catholic, apart from being baptised one, is because we do NOT believe in the bible-alone view. We believe Bible-alone ends up with one thing: subjective, relativistic, religious thinking. In short, fundamentalism, or at least where everyone's really in a church of one:themselves. Each being their own magisterium when it comes to the interpretation of texts.\n\n\nLastly, you live in Canada, your legislature's based in texts. So, where's your alibi? If you say their text is protected by the legislature or judges from maniacs, then I can use the same reason, too. That's the whole point of our magisterium.\n\n\nYou always paint me as either a bible-alone Christian, or someone with his head so far up Pope Benedict's ****, I can't think for myself.\n\n\nYou can't treat any reasonable Christian in here as an equal. You have to ridicule or parody them and put them at an extrme. Because if you didn't, you've got no argument.\n\n\nMichael Cook, like Howard Hughes before, have used a different view to me, but that's because they threat you as a reasonable person. Howard Hughes didn't stay long. I wonder how long Michael Cook will stand it?\n\n\nLike I said the other week, what sort of Christian were you, when you were one? Were you like the sort you claim we are? if not, then don't treat us the way you do.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Paul Rodden\n                    \n                        10 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nSorry: a brief comment seems to have gone AWOL.

Looks like we'll have to agree to disagree over whether humans are special. I think they are, of course, to humans, but not in any objective sense. I could invent a much better religion in which trees (for example) are 'in the image of' the god: they don't eat other life-forms, they live in symbiosis with fungi, and they selflessly let themselves be eaten by caterpillars.\n\nThanks, Greywizard, for the pointer to Obama's Call to renewal address, which, to my shame, I was ignorant of. Wow, a president-elect who understands Euthyphro (and has read it, I shouldn't wonder).\n\n...I have to explain why abortion violates some principle that is accessible to people of all faiths, including those with no faith at all.\n\nNow this is going to be difficult for some who believe in the inerrancy of the Bible, as many evangelicals do. But in a pluralistic democracy, we have no choice. Politics depends on our ability to persuade each other of common aims based on a common reality. It involves the compromise, the art of what's possible. At some fundamental level, religion does not allow for compromise. It's the art of the impossible. If God has spoken, then followers are expected to live up to God's edicts, regardless of the consequences. To base one's life on such uncompromising commitments may be sublime, but to base our policy making on such commitments would be a dangerous thing.\n\nMay that be Aisha's epitaph - and Theos's.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Michael Cook\n                    \n                        10 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nPaul. To your question as to how long I will last, the answer is not beyond today. I have to remind you of some things you said to me earlier, that there really is no point in my discussion with Greywizard. I'm sorry I didn't believe you earlier. Greywizard is clearly a very intelligent and well-read person. In truth I think there are probably many things we agree on, and I'm completely with the Obama quote, as would many many christians be. But when someone accuses perfectly peaceful people (who have made it clear they do not accept any text as being infallible or beyond criticism, and that the criteria for deciding whether or not a doctrine is 'true' or not is whether it conforms to Christ's teaching on compassion), of being personally responsible for bashing a little girls head in with rocks (and presumably for countless other atrocities), then you just know there's no point in carrying on.\n\n\nI don't know what sort of Christian Greywizard was, but this view does explain his deep antagonism towards christians; maybe all this arguing with christians, with it's deeply unnattractive \"You know, Paul, I wish you weren't so easy to demolish\" way, is a way of dealing with his own guilt for having been personally involved in such atrocities in the past. Who knows?\n\n\nBut Paul, please take your own advice and give this up.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Greywizard\n                    \n                        10 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nWell, Paul, thank you. This time you responded to me, and, don't look, but you are making an argument.\n\n\n\nYour argument is basically this. I (that's me, Greywizard) think that sacred texts are dangerous, because, say what you like about them, in the end, it's their sacredness, their absoluteness, that is dangerous.\n\n\n\nYour response is twofold, if I understand it. First, that all groups, movements, what have you, need texts, and second, that the Roman Catholic Church does not use the text alone. The Magisterium is the framework within which the Bible is read. Just taking the Bible alone gets you relativism, but the Roman Catholic Church is not guilty of that. Besides, everyone is dependent on texts, constitutions, bills of rights, what have you, and in the case of national communities, we have legislatures and courts to make sure these foundational documents are read aright.\n\n\n\nYou say that I always paint you as a 'bible alone Christian' when you're not, and then suggest that I think you have your head in a dark unhygienic place and are unable to think for yourself.\n\n\n\nIs that a fair summation of what you've said? If it is, then I still have a problem. The Magisterium may function in loco foris, but the church still holds that the Bible has God as its author. The Catechism even goes further and calls it the speech of God put down in writing under the the breath of the Holy Spirit. (81) True, it takes Tradition as equally important, but this simply widens the amount of text having binding infallible authority.\n\n\n\nThe important thing to notice is that holy texts are indefeasible. They cannot be amended. Their message is single and clear. Indeed, the Catechism speaks of the New Testament itself as demonstrating 'the process of living Tradition.' (83)\n\n\n\nThese things are all familiar to me, because Anglicanism includes this understanding of living tradition, and has never accepted the principle of Bible alone. But it still leaves the text untouched. When I say that other world views do not have sacred texts, what I am saying is that they do not venerate texts. They are not elevated and carried in procession. They are not censed. They are not read as though God were speaking, at that moment, through those words. Even constitutional texts are subject to revision and amendment. That's why, in the United States, the Amendments are so important, because one of the Amendments is the Bill of Rights. And so courts can in fact make law (that's what common law is all about) by way of interpreting law, and legislatures can make new law, by enacting new legislation. Sacred texts are not like that, and depend upon a degree of submission that is unhealthy for anyone who reads texts in that way, and makes the text itself play a different role in how it is followed.\n\n\n\nDo atheists (and as I have already said, I prefer, for myself, the title naturalist) have holy texts? No, they don't. There is a tradition of sceptical writing, stemming right from the wonderful Sextus Empiricus until now. But the texts are not holy, and will not be spared the most searching criticism. It is that habit of criticism - a habit that was on the way to being lost by the materialist followers of Hegel - which is one reason Marx's writings ended up so revered and uncritically applied - that saves atheism or naturalism or (secular) humanism from being trapped by words.\n\n\n\nI believe that we are fated to go on repeating the vicious violence that stems from holy books, so long as books remain holy. You ask me: \"Like I said the other week, what sort of Christian were you, when you were one? Were you like the sort you claim we are? if not, then don't treat us the way you do.\" I tried to be a liberal Christian, one who read the texts broadly, so as to include as many within their scope as possible. I had begun to find baptism as a mark of a community separated from the world, and the eucharist as the community meal of those so separated, as not only limiting, but corrupting. I tried my best to overlook the nasty parts of scripture, Jesus' horrific judgementalism, for instance, his absurd puritanism, his implicit misogyny, his Jewish exclusivism on the one hand, and his anti-Jewish condemnations on the other. And I could go on with the deep antisemitism that lies at the heart of the New Testament, and the post-Apostolic writings, and how that dominated holy tradition for so long, and, in truth, still does, since these things do not really change. They are all there, in the texts, waiting to do their damage.\n\n\n\nI cannot accept holy texts, and I hold responsible for the many evils done in the name of religion, those who continue to rely on those texts to exclude, dominate and in the end destroy people, no matter whether the texts are controlled by the Magisterium, or by individuals reading them alone. This makes no real difference to the effects those texts can have. Proof of that lies in the Inquisition, the Albigensian crusades, the subordination of women,..., and of course I could go on at length. Anyone who holds texts as sacred and unalterable, because they have God as their author, is guilty of the harm that is done in their name.\n\n\n\nSo, I second Nicholas' suggestion, taken from Obama's Call to Renewal:\n\n\n\nNow this is going to be difficult for some who believe in the inerrancy of the Bible, as many evangelicals do. But in a pluralistic democracy, we have no choice. Politics depends on our ability to persuade each other of common aims based on a common reality. It involves the compromise, the art of what's possible. At some fundamental level, religion does not allow for compromise. It's the art of the impossible. If God has spoken, then followers are expected to live up to God's edicts, regardless of the consequences. To base one's life on such uncompromising commitments may be sublime, but to base our policy making on such commitments would be a dangerous thing.\n\n\n\nMay that indeed be Aisha's epitaph - and Theos's. I am not sure, however, that basing one's life on uncompromising commitments is sublime. Aisha died because of such uncompromising commitments. Her death was one more cruel death in the long list of religion's crimes.\n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Greywizard\n                    \n                        10 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nI probably forgot to turn off the bolding.\n\n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Greywizard\n                    \n                        10 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nWon't this work?\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Greywizard\n                    \n                        10 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nSomeone's going to have to explain how this is done!!\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Paul Rodden\n                    \n                        10 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \n\n\n\nBold off?\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Greywizard\n                    \n                        10 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nThank you Paul.

Let's take just these words:\n\n\n\n\nAt some fundamental level, religion does not allow for compromise. It's the art of the impossible. If God has spoken, then followers are expected to live up to God's edicts, regardless of the consequences. To base one's life on such uncompromising commitments may be sublime, but to base our policy making on such commitments would be a dangerous thing.\n\n\n\nI have remarked, already, that this may not be sublime at all. It is not sublime, in a world of human beings, to be uncompromising. Sometimes honour may demand it, but generally it is not advised. Pragmatism works best. Hitler was just as uncompromising in his beliefs, as some of his opponents were uncompromising in theirs. This is what gods or demi-gods (like Marx or Hegel or Hitler or Mussolini or John Paul II or Benedict XVI) or even paper gods like the Bible, Quran, or Gita do.\n\n\n\nNelson-Pallmeyer thinks we can choose a non-violent Jesus, or a non-violent message from the Quran, or a non-violent Gita like Gandhi's. Not unless we demote them, and say that they are probably not the words of a god. That's why I like the idea of buses with messages saying, God probably does not exist. Probably he doesn't, or it, or she. There are very likely no gods. No certainty about it. That would go beyond the evidence. Science is not certain. Only, there's a high probability that, in standard cases, science has got it right. We know that because it works.\n\n\n\nReligion, unfortunately, has never worked. Oh, I know, it gives people some cold comfort when the world outside is colder. But in the end, it is a false comfort. Why not stand up to the bracing cosmic winds, alone, if need be?\n\n\n\nI grew up in India, and loved Edwin Arnold's The Light of Asia as a child, the story, told in poetry, about Siddharta Gautama, the Buddha. Two lines still resonate strongly with me:\n\n\n\nPray not! The darkness will not brighten!\nAsk\n\n\nNought from the silence, for it cannot speak!\n\n\n\nIt has been true so far. The trouble with those who believe otherwise, sadly, is that their uncompromising beliefs have littered the world with corpses. Yet it is they who blindly speak of a culture of death that will not observe their uncompromising prescriptions and prohibitions. I think it's time we had a little bit of scepticism, and if religious folks are troubled at having it bruited abroad, then they will have to get used to it, because more and more people, I suspect, can understand the reason for claiming that there is probably no god. The brutal killing of 13 year old Aisha at the hands of religious men is one of them.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        seculardemocrat\n                    \n                        10 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nMy knowledge of the theory of proof is confined to computational theory and it is clear that the �??god hypothesis�?? is not of this type. It is not a formal proof within an axiomatic system that we require.  The god hypothesis is a statement about the nature of the universe. \n\n\nThere are no formal proofs to be had within this universe of discourse. The strongest known procedure to obtain �??the truth�?? is the scientific method. Within this system it is perverse to claim that one cannot �??prove�?? the non-existence of a defined entity.\n\n\nConsider the claim: �??There exists within the orbit of Mercury a binary twin star of our sun which is of similar size and luminosity�??. To claim that the existence of this entity cannot be disproved is idiotic. The Bertrand Russell Teapot  was purposely selected to be exceedingly difficult to detect, indeed beyond the power of technology in his day. To exist, the proposed entity must, however weakly, interact with the rest of the universe. Science has detected an entity that interacts very weakly indeed �?? the neutrino. Scientists conjecture the existence of dark matter which interacts so weakly that its effects are only discernable in anomalies in the angular velocity of galaxies when calculated using presently detectable mass. Dark energy is only discernable because the observable universe is expanding at an accelerating rate. If an entity does not interact with our universe that�??s as good as it not existing. That goes for unicorns, leprechauns and the non-existent fairies at the bottom of my garden. I just know someone will say �??Love exists, how does that interact with the universe?�??. Well, to be detected, it must. It is a psychological entity that produces effects in the material world through behaviour. \n\n\nWhen a Christian says to me �??I have a God�??, I reply �??you are an intelligent, honest man so I believe you�?� as I would if you told me that you have a carpet in your home�??. But if you were to say to me that you can place this carpet on your patio, sit on it and ask it to take you to Samarkand, and it flies you there�?� then I will not believe you.\n\n\nThis is how I feel about this statement from the Nicene Creed: \n\n\n�?�. He came down from heaven, was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and became truly human.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we know that human parthenogenesis is pretty unlikely, to say the least, but we know it to be utterly impossible to produce a male foetus in this way from information theory and our knowledge of the SRY gene.\n\n\nTo achieve the above, a genetic history providing the information contained in the SRY gene is required. To misquote the famous line from the Life of Brian �??He�??s not the Holy Spirit he�??s a very naughty boy�??.\n\n\nThe religious constantly refer to interaction between supernatural entities and the universe, highly selective healing, some people being saved from disaster whilst others perish, communication with the creator and endless supernatural miracles. \n\n\nTheologians will, if allowed, lead the unwary into a morass of philosophical doubt.\n\n\nFocus on the bizarre claims of religion and the religious and you will find them out.\n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Greywizard\n                    \n                        10 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nI am trying very hard to understand why such a song and dance is made over the claim that negative existence cannot be proved. The emphasis here is on the verb 'to prove.' Let's look at this statement from seculardemocrat:\n\n\n\n\"The religious constantly refer to interaction between supernatural entities and the universe, highly selective healing, some people being saved from disaster whilst others perish, communication with the creator and endless supernatural miracles.\"\n\n\n\nNow, the question arises, can he prove that none of these things exist, that there are no interactions between the universe and supernatural entities, or people being healed by supernatural means, or communications between creatures and the creator? And the answer is: Of course not. But that doesn't mean that theologians can 'lead the unwary into a morass of philosophical doubt'? In fact, that's exactly what theologians don't want to do. They don't want to arouse doubts, because doubts have some basis somewhere. What theologians want to do, and do all the time, is to try to say that your doubts are, after all, not warranted. There is no proof to be had, so forget your worries and believe.\n\n\n\nScepticism is the province of the unbeliever, and the foundation of scepticism is the possibility of doubt. If you doubt it, read the sceptics. Everywhere they can they introduce reasons to doubt, reasons to question the unquestioning certainties of religion and other ideological systems.\n\n\n\nBut you cannot prove that God does not exist, they will say. That's what Alister McGrath says, and supposes that, therefore, the probability of God's existence is 50-50. Not so, says Dawkins, not 50-50 at all. The probability that God exists is more in the order of 10-90 or less. That's why Dawkins puts himself at 6 on a scale of 1-7. 1 is the absolute certainty that God exists, a well-populated spot. 7 is the absolute certainty that God does not exist. Not many takers, really. 6 is the great improbability that God exists. That's all that critical reason allows you to say.\n\n\n\nDoes there exist \"within the orbit of Mercury a binary twin star of our sun which is of similar size and luminosity\"? No, of course not. The very meaning of the terms in physics disallows that. Planets unknown before have been found because of anomalies in orbits of known bodies. So, no, such a binary twin star does not exist. But this is not the same thing that Russell was speaking of when he referred to the suppositious teapot. Read his argument again. He's just saying that, if you have no means of detecting something, you can't say, with 100% certainty that it does not exist. The probability of an undetectable teapot orbiting the sun is very low, however. No one has ever suggested anything different. So, let's not make heavy weather of the proof of non-existence, shall we? Otherwise, the religious people have all they need to go on. You can't prove the non-existence of God. Go on. Try. The most bizarre claim of religion is that God exists. But you can't prove that God does not exist. If you could prove this, the argument would have been over a long long time ago. So, relax. It's very very probable that there is no God.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Benjamin Ciaccio\n                    \n                        10 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nI think the late great comedian George Carlin said it best when he said, \"Atheism is a non-prophet organization.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time Samuel Butler's view was, \"Theist and atheist: the fight between them is as to whether God shall be called God or shall have some other name.\"  Now, I don't agree with him especially when the existence of God comes into question.  My questions would be, \"What if athiests are wrong?\"  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Nicholas\n                    \n                        10 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nYou are mistaken, Benjamin. Atheism is not an organization. Some atheists treat(ed) some people as prophets. Many theists didn't and don't call their god(s) \"God\". Atheists, by definition, do not have a god.\n\nThe answer to your question, if it is a question, is: if atheists are wrong, then (1) there exist one or more entities with god-like attributes, and (2) humans know nothing, absolutely nothing, about these gods or their attributes. Indeed, \"There could be some gods, but no-one can prove anything about any of them\" would be quite a good bus slogan.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Greywizard\n                    \n                        10 Nov\n                    \n                    \n                        \nWell, what if atheists are wrong?! It seems to me that Benjamin has been listening to too much Jesus. It's a bad habit. Jesus said, essentially, that those who disagreed with him were worthy of the hell of fire. Well, even Stalin couldn't promise that!!!! Hitler tended, not always, but usually, to burn his victims after they were dead. Jesus wanted his victims to burn, still alive, forever! Now, that's worthy of a god, I'm sure. What human could have dreamt that one up? But why, I wonder, should anyone think that the man who suggested such a monstrous thing is a messenger of love? Now, there's a real puzzle. I like Nicholas' conclusion: \"There could be some gods, but no-one can prove anything about any of them.\" Least of all, I hope, what Jesus thought of the god he believed in.\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\nSubscribe to debates \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Current Debate\n\nTheos will host a current debate about every two weeks.� Do login regularly to keep up to date with the discussions and be a part of the ongoing conversation.\n\nView the Current Debate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchived Current Debates \n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 28 JAN \nAre religious and national identities irreconcilable? 40 Comments | Latest 06 Feb \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 18 JAN \nCould a banker get through the eye of a needle? 29 Comments | Latest 28 Jan \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 07 JAN \nDoes morality need religion? 27 Comments | Latest 17 Jan \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 17 DEC \nWhat makes a wise choice? 10 Comments | Latest 05 Jan \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 08 DEC \nWhat does Christmas mean to people in Britain? 18 Comments | Latest 17 Dec \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 29 NOV \nCan we afford European solidarity? 23 Comments | Latest 07 Dec \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 19 NOV \nIs religion compatible with public order? 13 Comments | Latest 27 Nov \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 12 NOV \nAre students revolting? 5 Comments | Latest 15 Nov \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 05 NOV \nShould convicted prisoners get the vote? 11 Comments | Latest 08 Nov \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 01 NOV \nWhat's wrong with Halloween? 5 Comments | Latest 05 Nov \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 22 OCT \nHas the CSR redefined the British state? 7 Comments | Latest 01 Nov \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 15 OCT \nWhat is development for? 1 Comments | Latest 18 Oct \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 07 OCT \nShould benefits be universal? 5 Comments | Latest 15 Oct \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 28 SEP \nWill Ed Miliband 'do God'? 2 Comments | Latest 30 Sep \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 18 SEP \nDoes the government understand religious faith? 13 Comments | Latest 27 Sep \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 10 SEP \nWhat's wrong with Big Brother? 20 Comments | Latest 16 Sep \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 04 SEP \nWho's a fan of papal teaching? 23 Comments | Latest 09 Sep \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 27 AUG \nWhy is interest in Religious Studies growing? 15 Comments | Latest 02 Sep \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 20 AUG \nWhat has Biology to do with Ideology? 4 Comments | Latest 24 Aug \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 13 AUG \nShould we reform the welfare system?  2 Comments | Latest 18 Aug \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 06 AUG \nCan Religion save Democracy from Neo-Liberalism? 25 Comments | Latest 13 Aug \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 30 JUL \nShould the fixed retirement age be axed? 5 Comments | Latest 04 Aug \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 23 JUL \nCan Europe survive without Christianity? 42 Comments | Latest 29 Jul \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 16 JUL \nShould Britain ban the Burka? 32 Comments | Latest 23 Jul \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 09 JUL \nIs more news good news? 4 Comments | Latest 13 Jul \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 02 JUL \nDoes the 'Big Society' include Bishops in the Lords? 4 Comments | Latest 07 Jul \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 25 JUN \nAre we all progressives now? 5 Comments | Latest 27 Jun \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 17 JUN \nWill the Pope�??s visit to the UK have any relevance for non-Christians? 8 Comments | Latest 19 Jun \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 11 JUN \nHow should religious groups engage in political debate? 23 Comments | Latest 17 Jun \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 04 JUN \nShould faith schools be just for the faithful? 10 Comments | Latest 10 Jun \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 28 MAY \nDo we really face US style culture-wars in the UK? 8 Comments | Latest 04 Jun \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 21 MAY \nDo we need electoral reform?

          "North Wales Regional CommitteePWYLLGOR RHANBARTH Y GOGLEDD \n \nAdroddiad i'r Cynulliad 2003-04 \n \n1. Cyflwyniad \n \n1.1 Mae Pwyllgor Rhanbarth y Gogledd yn un o bedwar o \nbwyllgorau rhanbarth y Cynulliad. Mae'n cynnwys Conwy, Sir \nDdinbych, Sir y Fflint, Ynys Môn, Wrecsam a'r ardal o Wynedd sy'n \ncynnwys hen ardaloedd Arfon a Dwyfor. \n \n1.2 Rhwng mis Gorffennaf 2003 a mis Mawrth 2004, cadeiriwyd y \nPwyllgor gan Janet Ryder. Aelodau eraill y Pwyllgor yw Eleanor \nBurnham, Mark Isherwood, Alun Ffred Jones, Ann Jones, Denise \nIdris-Jones, Ieuan Wyn Jones, John Marek, Sandy Mewies, Alun \nPugh, Carl Sargeant, Karen Sinclair and Brynle Williams. Mae'r \nArglwydd Dafydd Elis Thomas yn Aelod ond nid yw'n mynychu \ncyfarfodydd gan mai ef yw'r Llywydd. \n \n1.3 Cyfarfu'r Pwyllgor bum gwaith rhwng mis Gorffennaf 2003 a \nmis Mawrth 2004.  Nodir y manylion yn Atodiad 1. \n \n2. Cylch Gwaith a Dull Gweithio \n \n2.1 Yn ôl Rheol Sefydlog 10.2, swyddogaeth y pwyllgorau \nrhanbarth yw cynghori’r Cynulliad Cenedlaethol ar faterion sy’n \nymwneud â’u rhanbarthau, effaith polisïau’r Cynulliad ar y \nrhanbarthau hynny, a gwaith cyrff cyhoeddus yn y rhanbarthau. \n \n2.2 Yn ystod ei gyfarfod cyntaf, aeth y Pwyllgor ati i wahodd y \ncyhoedd i fynegi eu barn ar faterion i'w trafod yng nghyfarfodydd y \ndyfodol.  Daeth y cynigion yn sail rhaglen waith ar gyfer y \nflwyddyn, a ddaeth ar gael yn yr ail gyfarfod ac fe'i cyhoeddwyd ar \nwefan y Cynulliad.  \n \n2.3 Roedd pwyslais y cyfarfodydd ar annog y cyhoedd i gymryd \nrhan, gydag ambell gyflwyniad er mwyn annog y drafodaeth.  Ar ôl \npob cyfarfod, aeth y Pwyllgor ati i baratoi adroddiad yn crynhoi'r \nsylwadau a fynegwyd gan bobl Gogledd Cymru.  Cyflwynwyd \ncopïau i'r Aelod Cynulliad, y pwyllgor neu'r awdurdod cyhoeddus \nperthnasol er mwyn iddynt gael ymateb i'r pwyntiau a godwyd.  \n \n 12.4 Roedd llawer o aelodau'r cyhoedd yn bresennol trwy gydol y \nflwyddyn, gyda chyfartaledd o bron i gant yn mynychu cyfarfodydd \nym Mhwllheli ac yn Llangollen.  Ar ôl derbyn cais gan un o'r \ncyhoedd, cynhaliwyd cyfarfod peilot gyda'r nos ac argymhellwyd i'r \nPwyllgor Busnes y dylid diwygio Rheolau Sefydlog y Cynulliad er \nmwyn caniatáu i'r Pwyllgor gyfarfod gyda'r nos ddwywaith y \nflwyddyn (allan o gyfanswm o chwe cyfarfod). \n \n2.5 Mae'r Pwyllgor wedi parhau'n ymrwymedig i fynd ati mewn \nmodd cynhwysol o weithio.

But we hope supporters will give generously – at least £1 from every adult would be great, but more if they you can afford it.\n\n“We need 14 volunteers to help collect donations for this very worthwhile cause so I would be grateful if they could get in touch as soon as possible.”\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nThis entry was posted on Saturday, April 24th, 2010  at 9:43 am and is filed under Trust News.

My best\nthanks and best congratulations on your success: in my\nopinion the paper has now undoubtedly found its feet.\nThe improvement is a tremendous one and a serious one,\nand, let us hope, firm and for good. The length of\nPlekhanov’s articles and the abundance of anti-liquidationism\n(about which one of the workers’ deputies writes to me) are\nnow questions of detail; it won’t be difficult to correct\nmatters in Ibis respect, now that the paper has taken a firm\nstand, and I think that the workers on the spot will see at\nonce bow to make the necessary correction. We have also\nreceived the detailed letter of a member of the staff (who\nunfortunately has not the pleasant “deputy” quality), and\nwe were very glad of it, congratulating him on every kind\nof success. It seems as though now (and only now, after\nthe\nSt—v[1]\n\nadventure) the period of wavering has ended ...\ntouch wood!...\n\n\n\nI don’t advise you to present Plekhanov with ultimatums:\nit is too early, it may do harm!! If you do write to him,\nwrite as kindly and mildly as possible, He is valuable\nnow because he is fighting the enemies of the working-class\nmovement.\n\n\n\nAs regards Demyan Bedny, I continue to be for. Don’t\nfind fault, friends, with human failings! Talent is rare.\nIt should be systematically and carefully supported. It\nwill be a sin on your conscience, a great sin (a hundred\n\n    \n\ntimes bigger than various personal “sins”, if such occur...)\nagainst the democratic working-class movement, if you\ndon’t draw in this talented contributor and don’t help\nhim. The disputes were petty, the cause is a serious one.\nThink over this!\n\n\n\nAs regards expansion, I have recently written in detail\nto one of the Prosveshcheniye people; I hope you also have\nseen the letter. I, too, am in favour of financial caution:\nto provide the same six pages (the present extra sheets) in\nanother form, with a different sauce and title and content:\n4 pages of Sunday supplement for the advanced workers + 2\npages of a “workers’ kopek” for 1 kopek, for the masses,\nto win a hundred thousand readers, with an especially\npopular content. You shouldn’t imitate Luch but go your\nown road, the proletarian road: 4 pages for the advanced\nworkers and 2pages (and later even 4)\nfor the masses, for a\nlong and stubborn battle for 100,000 readers. We must go\nwide and deep, into the masses, and not follow intellectual\npatterns like Luch.\n\n\n\nOnce again greetings, congratulations and best wishes.\n\n\n\nYours,\n\n V. I.\n\n\n\nAnother special greeting to Vitimsky: his article about\nthe workers’ press and workers’ democracy against\nthe\nliberals[2] was very successful!! And the Bogdanov “Ideology”\nis certain to heresy: I promise you that I will prove this\nexactly!![3]\n\n\n\nMarxists are glad of an increase in circulation when it\nis increased by Marxist articles, and not by articles against\nMarxism. We want a principled paper—all the contributors\nand readers of Pravda want it—a Marxist, not Machist\npaper? Isn’t that so?\n\n\n\nP.S. The address is not Paronen, but Poronin (Galizien),\nand be sure to add on the wrapper: via Warsaw-Frontier–\nZakopane.\n\n\n     \n\n    \n\n\n    Notes\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n [1]\n\n Who this refers to has not been established.—Ed.\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[2]\n\nLenin refers to the article by M. S. Olminsky (A. Vitimsky) “Kto s\nkem?” (“Who Is on Whose Side?”), published in Pravda No. 106,\nMay 10, 1913. The article was part of the polemic with Luch\nconcerning the conference between the editors of bourgeois\npublications and representatives of the workers’ press. The conference\nwas called for the purpose of protesting at the introduction of\nharsher laws against the press. The chairman of the conference did\nnot allow a vote on the draft resolution submitted by the Pravda\nrepresentatives. They and representatives of a number of trade\nunion papers refused to sign the liberal editors’ resolution.\nBesides the representatives of Rech, Russkaya Molva, Sovremennoye\nSlovo and Dyen, etc., =\n\nonly the representatives of Luch and Nasha\nZarya signed the resolution, thus acting against the workers’\npapers represented at the conference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[3]\n\nOn Lenin’s insistence A. A. Bogdanov’s article “Ideology” (from\nthe “Dictionary of Foreign Words” series) was rejected by Pravda\nas anti-Marxist. Concerning the statement which Bogdanov then\nsent to Pravda announcing his resignation from the paper, Lenin\nwrote a “Letter to the Editor” which was published in the\nnewspaper Put Pravdy No. 9, January 31, 1914 =\n\n(see present edition, Vol. \n20, pp. 93–94).\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \n      \t\n\t      <\n\t\t  backward\n\t    \t \t\n\t      forward\n\t\t  >\n\t    \n\t\n\t      Works\n\t\t  Index   |  \n\n\t      Volume 35\n\t    \t | \t\n\t      Collected Works\n\n\t        |   L.I.A.

But new Powys Conservative Councillor, Russell George did just that today. The Council was considering a proposal to sell off the old Market Hall in Newtown, Montgomeryshire, which in my and Russell's opinion would have been a failure to show reasonable responsibility towards the 36 Market Traders who run businesses from there. Well, Russell managed to persuade a majority of the Council's Executive Board to back him. Any decision to dispose has now been deferred until a planning application by Tesco, which is currently being considered, has been decided. I'm not sure what the thinking is behind this. Perhaps, Tesco may be 'persuaded' to pick up some of the cost of maintaining the Market Hall. Who knows. But it was a great decision.\n\nI was very surprised to hear that the Liberal Democrat members of the Executive Board didn't support Russell, and the Market Traders of Newtown -  despite the Market Hall being in the ward of a Lib Dem Councillor. I understand Montgomeryshire's MP, Lembit Opik had also been in touch with the traders. The Lib Dem councillors seem to have totally ignored both of them. Interesting - and especially so for the Market Traders. Anyway, lets hear it for Councillor Russell George - a man who gets things done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nGlyn Davies\n\n\nat\n18:05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\ncomments:\n        \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Christopher Wood\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nHere here\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nTue Jul 15, 07:26:00 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnonymous\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nThe Liberal Democrats have lost the plot in Montgomeryshire and this is just another example\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nTue Jul 15, 09:28:00 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnonymous\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\n...

I'll check tomorrow, and apologise if its appropriate. \nIn fact a majority of the Board behaved responsibly (in my opinion) and deserve praise.  Its just that I know that Russell had been in discussions about this issue with the Market Traders last week, and involved me in the discussions. Also, he's the only one of the names you refer to who is a member of the Board. And I only blog about what I know.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nTue Jul 15, 11:28:00 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnonymous\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nThank goodness the Lib Dems won't be representing us in parliament after the next election.  They KNOW they are going to loose the seat to you as long as Opik represents them.  And they are too cowardly to get rid of him.  Even though he's doing them untold damage on a daily basis - witness the farce being played out at the moment.  All of our family used to vote for them.  After this week, none of us will.

I suspect it could easily have been a developer spotting an opportunity, in which case the offer would have been subject to some caveats.  What I would like to see would be aquisition by the Mid Wales Food and Land Trust, who were too late showing an interest, but now will hav etime to develop their ideas.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nWed Jul 16, 08:22:00 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Millington\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nGlyn - I like Gary and Russell attended yesterdays board meeting and I have to say I agree, Cllr George made his point regarding the Market Hall, he made it well, so well that his comments may of been what persuaded a few other board members who were perhaps on the fence regarding the issue. I also agree with Gary when he says Cllrs White, Mills, Harris and Torrens also gave what can only be described as heartfelt pleas for the Market Hall. Well Done to all of them, they did as Gary rightly points work hard yesterday for the benefit of their electorate.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nWed Jul 16, 12:16:00 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngary price\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nGlyn, You may like to have a look a Russell's posting of Newtown Market on his blog? He rightly points out the fact that all the Newtown Cllrs worked hard and left officers of the County Council red faced? The Independent Group Montgomeryshire & Labour Members also suppoted the retention of the Market it was the Powys Independant Alliance & Lib Dem Board Members that voted to sell it.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nWed Jul 16, 07:32:00 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnonymous\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\n\"...

There is no disagreement twixt us at all Gary. I have checked and my comment that the Lib Dems opposed the plan to save the Markey Hall from closure was being broadcast widely. I heard it from several sources.

How amazing is religion - so cold. I sit in a great mansion of grey stone - with enormous grey pillars where some man tried to reach the sky with painting his drawing on His building. Some man tried to reach god with his excellence, his splendour, his money. The roof of the church is high away with a concrete pattern of spiderwebs. It is all grey, except for the colour on the windows, the beautiful windows, which are exquisite and grand and multicoloured, all made for the His glory, and yet are still cold. A man plays on the organ, music by Haydn who spent years writing music to the glory of god. A priest reads the bible with a cold voice. The congregation sit and stand and sing and breathe without emotion. The choir sing because they like singing I suppose. It is frigid. The whole fucking thing is so frigid.\n\n\t\tMonday 4 October\n\n\t\tWell October is autumn. M returns closer and warmer. We are like children learning everything there is, learning to be free and to play.\n\n\t\tI am bored with my movement class. We are told to play games with our feet and communicate - such lovely feet you have Anne, such a lovely spine you have Pauline - but they are the games we play with our lovers any way.\n\n\t\tTuesday 5 October\n\n\t\tI am here at 64 Carlton Hill with M and though we don't disturb much it is too much - two bodies grunting through the night, the whispering walls, the toilet flushes - so we have to find somewhere this week or the friction, the ugliness will be upon me.\n\n\t\t13 October\n\n\t\tTHE IMPERIAL LIGHTHOUSE SERVICE\n\n\t\tIn its heyday, the Imperial Lighthouse Service proudly owned 17 lighthouses in different parts of the grand British Commonwealth. The lighthouse keepers were solitary men returning once only every six months to homeland England. But those days have passed with the fading of our great empire. Just two are left, one off the Falkland Islands and the other somewhere in the Caribbean. They are maintained by the only four employees of the Imperial Lighthouse Service left in the world today. They are directed by the marine division of the Ministry of Trade in High Holborn. Some 69 men, though, are still receiving pensions from the Service. I would like to sing 'seventeen lighthouses of the Imperial Lighthouse Service' to the tune of ten green bottles, but it doesn't go very well.\n\n\t\tThe Military and Orchestral Musical Instrumental Makers Trade Society has 160 members. The Amalgamated Association of Beamers, Twisters and Drawers has over 1,000 members.\n\n\t\t14 October\n\n\t\tI am sitting on M's bed looking out of our window watching the sun through the dense mass of leaves. It is like a pulsating star, as the eyes move ever so slightly so the sun flashes through a new aperture in the leaves. Around where the point sun shines brilliantly, the leaves are black, but further away from the point so the leaves become greener.\n\n\t\t17 October\n\n\t\tDays, words and feelings seem to get left behind at this time. Only by a conscious effort have I remembered some things from last night for instance. Without really knowing why I found myself at a concert given by Van de Graaf Generator. At the end of the concert, this long-haired freak started really shrieking his head around which was wonderful, a cool fresh breeze brushed by my own clammy heated head.\n\n\t\tM and I have moved into room 14, the Oakley Holiday Apartments, 93 Oakley St. tel no: 352 9970. Last night, for the first time in my life, I came home from work to find my woman in the kitchen making dinner. And for the first time in her life, she found herself waiting for her man to come home from work to eat dinner. M has problems with work as always, maybe she will take a job in a restaurant, and then we will never see each other.\n\n\t\tJean-Christophe is a mixture of Italian, French, Swiss and English. He has been studying Reich body techniques, growth therapy, and is looking to start professional work in London. He came to me in Battersea Park when I was playing the recorder. He has a guru and meditates and is a vegetarian.\n\n\t\t19 October\n\n\t\tM and I were invited to dinner by Dad and his mistress.\n\n\t\tI played football in the park and kicked Stewart's ball into the lake. The ball floated around going here and there, but refusing to come to the side. Stewart and Martin watched and pleaded with the wind to blow it to the side. I tried to find a gardener and thought of the problem as an initiative test. Then Peter turned up with a man with wellingtons that reached to his breast. It was something I had not thought of - such gigantic wellingtons, it was very funny.\n\n\t\tI went to dinner with Peter and Tony - they are up and leaving to Germany to live in Bernau and maybe, maybe I can have their flat which is fantastic. There is a garden, a large front room, a bathroom, a kitchen, another little room and the living room - wow - let's wait and see.\n\n\t\tM said she would return after work, but, as yet, hasn't appeared.\n\n\t\tA beautiful letter arrives from N.\n\n\t\t21 October\n\n\t\tI cried some tears this morning because I realised what I had done, I had been hard, hard and cold, continually till M found herself weeping. I cried because I felt satisfied with that. Maybe it's good, I wonder now, maybe that is how it should be for M.\n\n\t\tI met a man named David, sitting alone writing a book on philosophy - on the essence of consciousness or some such thing. I suggested he step outside his work occasionally and look objectively at what he is doing, to think about the fact that some problems could stem from our mental language, and to read de Bono's 'Mechanisms of the Mind'. At least, for an hour or so, he stopped the gritty circulars in my head about the relationship with M.\n\n\t\tI am helping out a bit with the Latin America Festival.\n\n\t\t22 October\n\n\t\tLast night I saw a Bergmann film, 'The Silence'. It was about two sisters. One, called Esther, is dying and the other has a small boy. Esther is a writer, she is the quieter, more sedate, the passive, the thinker, and is in love with her sister, who is much more interested in a good time, making herself look good, going out, finding men. She is self-assured and hard. The latter was once very dependant on Esther but now finds herself completely independent of her and almost despising her. Esther is caught spying on her sister whilst making love with a stranger, and, in the ensuing argument, the sister accuses Esther: 'you're so damn full of self-importance'.\n\n\t\tI wonder if I identify with Esther. I tried to tie in this self-importance with the arrogance Mum accuses me of, and the totally different mental worlds M and I live in. I am always aware of what she might be doing, and very careful not to let her down, but she is blase, doing exactly what she wants even if it means I am put out somehow. But maybe what I have to understand is that she has no mental image in her mind that says I must go now or else I will be late and keep someone waiting, because she doesn't think of herself as that important. Here is my self-importance - the way I look at it, is that I am so important that everybody is thinking in terms of me, and that therefore I can't let anyone down.\n\n\t\tThere's an organisation called The Screw, Nut, Bolt and Rivet Union.\n\n\t\t26 October\n\n\t\tAutumn is at its most beautiful. It is radiant in its colours, proud in its metamorphosis and high with the wind and change. Amersham found me sailing in a wood, breaking sticks, skipping, trying to play like a child but finding my playmate more interested in poisonous mushrooms. There was a tiger in the forest, a very dangerous tiger. I looked for it and killed it. And then I raced home to London, running from train to train, hating cities and communications and mixing it all with reading Genet and his beauteous pricks and brothel sex.\n\n\t\t'You see,' Jean said, 'there is a living force that connects everything, we are all energy and vibrations and there are forces that connect us. What you believe is that we have a computer brain and that we are all generic programmes.' 'Yes,' me speaking, 'absolutely birth and copulation and death, if we start talking about deeper levels and deeper feelings and contact with our centres etc. etc. could we just as easily say they are all programmes as well, programmes can be very complicated or very simple. On the other hand if we start talking about forces outside of us and something that isn't programmable within us then we must ask ourselves, maybe the all powerful Christian judging god can exist - if he can exist then we ought to do something about it.'\n\n\t\tM tells me now the Work was not going well when she left. I suggested maybe the Work was to blame, as I with Christianity. I always, but always, thought I was to blame for my lack of closeness to and understanding of god, but it wasn't, it was god's fault because he wasn't there. How could I tell that to M, that maybe she had overtaken the Work - had seen through it.\n\n\t\tSometimes the moon can be seen through the trees from our window.\n\n\t\tOn Saturday night I went to a party at Andre's house, I nearly didn't go, but M had been cold and I was a little bored. Anyway, at this party, was a girl called Judy Gardner. We'd met before, in New Zealand, when she picked me up hitchhiking. As a result of that meeting, she went on to take my job at Sandoz. So we spent half the night talking about Otago doctors! The other half I danced, smiling at some drama people and watching their little games as they interacted with mine.\n\n\t\tI was supposed to be organising one night of the theatre at the Oval but it turned out to be a full farce, with quarrels over timing and lights. The Chilean mime was very good, it was just two people, but with one woman doing 90% of the work. She really was excellent.\n\n\t\tIt was good with M this week. I took everything as it came, and did my own thing, but M went sour on me still and we came back from the Yes concert in our tiny little shells until finally she talked of things that disturbed her calm.\n\n\t\tI am reading less, I am writing less, I am feeling definitely less, and I am smoking too much.

          "Local Action - East Anglia\n\n\nEast Anglia\n\nBy Trevor Garrod\n\nConsultation pledge Anglia Railways Communications Manager Peter Meades was speaker at the summer meeting of the branch in Ipswich. As well as pointing to the company‘s achievements, he answered a wide range of questions, many about better links and more attractive fares between Cambridgeshire and the rest of the region. He promised consultation with rail users, including RDS, over the 1999 timetable.\n\nThe preserved Hastings diesel unit — a train built nearly 40 years ago to run inter-city services between London and Hastings — is currently based at Norwich and being used mainly to provide extra capacity on the routes to Yarmouth and Lowestoft. RDS members suggested this unique train be used to supplement Anglia‘s heavily used fleet.\n\nArmy on move During July, four military trains used the reopened line from Wymondham to Dereham, operated by our corporate member, the Mid Norfolk Railway Preservation Trust. Following a visit by the Railway Inspectorate, a number of minor jobs are being carried out prior to the reinstatement of a passenger service, planned for later this autumn.\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn to the contents page.\n\nReturn to Local Action contents page.\n\nReturn to the Railwatch home page.\n\nJump to the Railwatch backTrack page.\n\n\n\nYou can email Railwatch editor Ray King at editor@railwatch.org.uk (or just click on this link), e-mail Deltic Design with comments about the Railwatch Web pages, or visit their web site.\n\n\n\nPages produced on an AcornRiscPC\n\n",

But the object of\nyour passion may not know that you exist or how you feel. You\nneed to talk to find out if you have things in common and get to\nknow each other better.\n\nSo how can you tell if someone really likes you? Do they\ntalk to you, ask your opinion, listen to your answers, want to be\nwith you, treat you well? Respect is always a good place to\nstart. No good relationship can exist without it. So\nanyone who avoids you, can’t remember your name, or is mean –\nprobably doesn’t love you!\n\nRelationships\n\nRelationships with other people, whether family, friends, or\nothers, are the most essential thing in our lives after food,\ndrink, shelter and warmth and can be the happiest moments that we\never experience. But sadly, what we may want from relationships is\nnot always what we get.\n\nFor information about relationships or support dealing with\nrelationships that are hard, the teen issues website may\nhelp. There are also the Beat bullying and Bullying websites that offer help\nand information on this issue.\n\nA good relationship is one where you can say you're friends. One\nwhere you've got trust, respect, and can talk honestly to each\nother and above all, be yourself.\n\nIf you’re looking for love and can’t find it, work on developing\nfriendships. People who make and maintain close friendships\nlearn valuable skills to apply next time for a different kind of\nlove.\n\nSex\n\nWhat is sexual activity? This may include any activity that\nsexually arouses you or your partner and might include talking and\nflirting, kissing, looking, touching, stroking each other, kissing\nusing tongues, removing clothes, and touching each others\ngenitals. Sexual activity is not just about the penis\npenetrating the vagina.\n\nSo what do people mean when they say they have had sex? They may\nbe referring to the above, or may be talking about penetrative sex\n- when a vagina or anus is penetrated by a boy's penis, or oral sex\n- when the mouth and tongue is used to pleasure and stimulate the\npenis, vagina or anus.\n\nIf you can really feel good, relax and have fun together, then\nwhen you are ready to have sex, the whole experience is likely to\nbe a much better one for both of you. Take your time and do\nthings only when you're ready.\n\n\n\nWhat is the law on sex? The laws on sex are there to protect you\nfrom abuse and to support people who do not wish to have sex before\nthey are ready. The law says it's legal for you to consent to\nsexual relationships from the age of 16.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAsk for advice\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you need help and would like to talk to a personal advisor from Connexions, you\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcan email them using KCcentral's electronic form.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmail your question\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tContacts\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nA\nPlace to talk\n\nChelsea\nbus stop\n\nConnexions\ncentre\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRelated links\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nR U thinking\n\nChildline\n\nThis is\nabuse\n\nTerrence Higins Trust\n\nYoung gay men\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMain Menu\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHome\n\tEducation and careers\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tEvents and activities\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tGames and competitions\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tGet Creative\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tHousing and money\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tSports, health and lifestyle\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tDrugs alcohol and tobacco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tEmotional health and wellbeing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tHealth\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tSexual health and relationship\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tLove relationships and sex\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tSafe sex\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tSexuality\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tYouth Sports\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tTravel and transport\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tFaith organisations\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tYour safety\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tYour voice\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSearch for things to do near you\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChoose an activity:Any\nArts, Music and Dance \nClubs and Projects \nHealth\nJobs and training \nSport and Games\nSupport and Advice\n\n\nChoose a monthOver next month\nJuly 2011\nAugust 2011\nSeptember 2011\nOctober 2011\nNovember 2011\nDecember 2011\nJanuary 2012\nFebruary 2012\nMarch 2012\nApril 2012\nMay 2012\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAccessibility\n\tTerms and conditions\n\tPrivacy statement\n\tContact us\n\tCopyright © 2011 The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n",

(Such as official overseas visitors to the Championships).\n\nThe committee fixed the entrance fee at one guinea and produced a lapel membership badge which was based on a design by Allon Renton, who played for England 1948 to 1952 and was art master at a school in Winchester.\n\nIn 1962 the Badminton Association of England set aside a newly built lounge with a bar at Wembley during the All England Championships where drinks and light refreshments could be bought.\n\nThe entrance fee was to cover the cost of the badge and other expenses incurred in running the club. Ken Livingstone, a member of the committee writing in the Badminton Gazette in 1963 claimed that membership was growing steadily\n\nThe National Badminton Museum has a visitors’ book for the All England Badminton Club – dated 1996 when 28 members signed. It appears the book was put in a cupboard and forgotten as no other names or dates appear at all.\n\nWhat has happened to the All England Badminton Club?\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t",

She reminds me that we are totally accepted and loved by Christ and that if we turn from the past – whatever it contains – we really can have new and vibrant life in Christ. I think she is awesome and would have chosen the name if I could have.\n\nHowever, it is also Sr Mary Magdalen’s feast day, her first in community, and I would like to ask you all to join us in keeping her especially in your prayers today, and those who have also taken this name.\n\nToday, Sr Mary Magdalen and I have been identifying a herb in our garden. Mother Anne said she thought it was St John’s Wort, but Sr Benedict thought not so out came Culpepper’s Herbal and a book on wildflowers and we identified it – it does help a lot that Sr is an artist so notices things that I don’t. It turns out that Sr Benedict was right – it is Loosestrife ( good for haemorrhage/bleeding in many forms ) not St John’s Wart. We had a nice time in recreation later looking at the Herbal and finding interesting uses for common things – did you know that you can stuff pieces of red beetroot up your nose to clear your head? Neither did we and it’s not something we are going to rush out and try, no it’s far nicer to eat instead. pax sr marie therese, St Mary Magdalene – pray for us.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis entry was posted in Uncategorized.

I left a comment under your entry to the novitiate, again, many congratulations and prayers, I look forward to reading about it all in a few weeks and seeing what your new name is – Sr …?\n\nThankyou for your greetings to Sr Mary Magdalen, I will pass them on and she will probably read them too when she gets a chance, again, our greetings and blessings to your Sr Magdalen too.\n\n     I don’t know if it is a general Benedictine custom to offer things up for the sister on her feast day but we do exactly that here too. A board with the sisters name on goes up outside chapel and we are asked to pray for her, Mass is also offerred for her and her intentions and she has a vase of flowers at her place in refectory which she takes up to her cell during the day. Sr Mary Magdalen usually does all the flowers as she is very artistic, and I should have done hers but I am not good with these things so had help from our novice mistress Mother Anne, she showed me and basically did the whole thing herself, I must learn though. pax et bonum, sr marie therese.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tMary\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t23 July, 2008 at 12:37 am\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tReply\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\tDear Sr. Marie-Therese and Sr. Mary Magdalen,\n\nHappy feast day to you Sr. Mary Magdalen!  You will be in my prayers today – as you all are every day!  I am wondering if there are any special things done on a sisters feast day to celebrate?  A special recreation or does the sister have more prayer time or do you all bake her a cake!?  Or is it just another day with just best wishes extended or what?  I have always wondered what, if anything, is done in monasteries for the sisters feast days.  \n\nI too have also found the herbs and plants and their medicinal uses fascinating.   But maybe you all want to rethink that about putting the red beetroot up your nose and be the first to document it for posterity!  Ha, only kidding!  It DOES sound very unpleasant!  But you have to wonder if it might not be better than a lot of the OTC meds on the shelves that don’t work at clearing your head!\n\nMary\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tMary\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t23 July, 2008 at 12:40 am\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tReply\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\tDear Sr. Marie-Therese,\n\nSorry, I think I posted this at a time I didn’t hit the refresh button as your blog site was open on my computer for so long!

Culpeppers is wonderful – you probably know it if you are also interested in herbs – especially reading the ancient uses. It’s odd but it seems that loads of the herbs are diuretic and affect menstrual bleeding – the Loosestrife we found ( and have loads of ) does this so we won’t be making it into tea’s. I am going to start making raspberry leaf tea – for cramps – and drying some of the more common herbs for sister Teresa Mary ( I almost wrote my name, it sometimes gets confusing, and it’s your name too) to use in the kitchen. I also found a load of lovely Basil in the court. I think in the past the sisters must have been really into using herbs as there seem to be a lot of them growing all over the garden. pax sr marie therese.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tursula\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t23 July, 2008 at 5:07 pm\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tReply\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\tMy comp was down all Mon.

Though we don’t go running around all the time and our busyness in no ways compares to working outside we do have set things at set times so have to fit things in. This week I am bell ringer again so I am constantly clock watching instead of just going at the sound of the bell.\n\n   Herbal rememdies are good, I enjoy seeing what we can use but am not so good at identifying them so have to be very careful as I don’t want to poison anyone or myself. pax sr marie therese.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tLeave a Reply to noviceship Cancel reply\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYour email address will not be published.

It was made by Plymouth silversmith, Peter Rowe in 1698. It was commissioned to commemorate the building of Smeaton���s first lighthouse on the Eddystone reef and is thought to be the only representation of the very first lighthouse before changes were made to the lantern in 1699.\n\nThe Drake cup is on display at Buckland Abbey, home of Sir Francis Drake. The cup was thought to have been given to Drake by Queen Elizabeth I. It depicts a globe to celebrate his circumnavigation and was made by a Zurich silversmith in around 1571.\n\nThe south west had a thriving silversmith community in the 18th century and an assay office was set up in Exeter in 1700. The museum���s collection is representative of many of these silversmiths and holds examples from makers such as Pentecost Symons, Samuel Blatchford and Zacchariah Williams.\n\nThe museum also holds on loan a number of items of church plate from local churches. This includes some of the earliest existing pieces of ecclesiastical silver in the south west by John Jones of Exeter in 1575 who was commissioned to make communion cups after the Reformation in England.\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHome\n\tA to Z\n\tSitemap\n\tText version\n\tFAQs\n\tCopyright, Disclaimer and Privacy\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t�� Plymouth City Council, Armada Way, Plymouth PL1 2AA Tel 01752 668000\n\n\n\n\tRate this page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n",

And never in front of women and children. I'm a tad old fashioned about this - even though I understand that young women out on the town these days are much more foul-mouthed than young men. So today's occurrence was unfair in the extreme. Fate dealt me a poor hand.\n\nFor some reason, I've been feeling a bit down for a while and this morning had been a bit stressful. I'd been to the Newtown studio to do a piece for Post Cynta on our manifesto, which was to be launched at 10.30 in North Wales. Problem was that I hadn't read the final version, didn't know the lines we were going on - and it was in Welsh, which is a beautiful language but which I still find difficult. And Iolo ap Dafydd shows me no mercy these days. Anyway, I survived and was belting up to Northop for the launch, having asked my good friend, Brynle Williams for directions.\n\nProblem was that Brynle's directions were duff. He sent me right instead of left. After a fruitless search for a promised set of crossroads, I rang BW on his mobile. No answer. Rang 4 times. No answer. Launch time approaching and now highly stressed. 5th call and Brynle answered. He hadn't even finished saying \"Hello\" when I .....how shall I put this......expressed my view of his directions, outlined displeasure at my predicament and suggested what he might do to help - but utilising words of variety and colour! It will not help my reputation if I record precisely what I said.\n\nAnd just guess what Brynle said, and as cool as you like. \"I'll come and collect you when I've dropped Cheryl Gillan and David Cameron off at the launch - and by the way my mobile is on open mike in the car.\" I felt a bit as the Earl of Oxford must have done when he farted in front of Queen Elisabeth 1st, and left the country for 10 years in shame. The only consolation is that David Cameron knows how desperate I was to get to support him at the launch. And Brynle will dine out for weeks on this of course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nGlyn Davies\n\n\nat\n20:34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\ncomments:\n        \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnonymous\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nSwearing in front of a toff Glyn, tut tut!\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nThu Mar 29, 10:54:00 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft Field\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nI felt a bit as the Earl of Oxford must have done when he farted in front of Queen Elisabeth 1st, and left the country for 10 years in shame.\n\nDid the queen say \"how dare you fart before me\" and the Earl replied \"Sorry, I didn't know it was your turn.\"\n\nSorry old joke. \n\nVery funny blog though.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nFri Mar 30, 01:29:00 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDylan Jones-Evans\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nDidn't realise Brynle was a toff :)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nFri Mar 30, 05:40:00 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsanddef\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nSounds like an episode from Fawlty Towers :-)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nSat Mar 31, 02:13:00 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCure Red Face\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nHi, I am Cory Thiarello writing for FaceDoctor.

My wife is 15wks with twins.  Yesterday, one of the twins sack ruptured.  The other twin's sack is fine at the moment.  Both babies had a heartbeat.   I have read many websites to try to get educated as much as possible.  However, I am in search of information that can only come from experience with this nightmare.\n \n\nHow can I help my wife?  She is on bed rest and I am taking care of our 18month old girl and of her. Day to day activities are not issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             My concern is helping her with the possibility of losing one or both babies.  She is going to be shattered as being a mother is part of her DNA.  \n \n\nWe are soul mates and I know her extremely well, however, a women's mind is very unique and I would appreciate any insight on how best to support her during this time.\n \n\nThanks\n\nMark\n\t\t\t\t\n \n \n   \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLast edited by Mark B(85); 12-03-11 at 04:20.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n   \n \n \n \n      Reply With Quote    \n \n \n \n\t    12-03-11 09:56   #2  \n        Linda H \n   Netmums Parent Supporter\nDisclaimer   \n \n \n  \tJoin Date\n\tJan 2005\n\tPosts\n\t20,379\n\n \n \n \n     \n\t\t\t\t\tHello Mark,\n\nI am sorry to read about what has happened - it must be a very worrying time for you and your wife\n\nYou are looking for advice on how to support your wife if the worst happened and she lost one of the twins - have I got that right?\n\nBeing there for your wife will help, letting her talk to you when she wants to and just generally lots of TLC.

Sounds like you are already a very supportive hubby, and you just need to be there for her. I had a mmc in November and hubby was the strong one. For me, I didn't need any words, a hug helps so much. It's an awful thing for any couple to go through. It was our first pregnancy and the positive thing we've taken from it is how much we really want children. \n\nTake care of you as well as your wife, sending you my best wishes.\n\nFiona\n\t\t\t\t\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n      Reply With Quote    \n \n \n \n\t    12-03-11 16:37   #4  \n     Mark B(85) \n   Hi, I'm New   \n \n \n  \tJoin Date\n\tMar 2011\n\tPosts\n\t4\n\n \n \n \n     \n\t\t\t\t\tThank you for the prompt replies.

We had an Ulrasound on Monday and found two strong heartbeats  Absolutely brilliant news.  We have another appointment next Monday with a specialist.  \n \n\nOur doctors believe that the one twin that still has a complete sac is helping to keep the twin with the ruptured sac safe by keeping the uterus open and the pregnacy to continue.\n \n\nWe are still extremely anxious about the situation but feel some relief.  I do have some questions:\n \n\n1. What is the rate at which amniotic fluid is created?  Christine is 16 weeks.\n\n2. What are the potential effects for the twin with reduced fluid?\n\n3. What can we do to help increase production of amniotic fluid?\n \n\nThanks\n\nMark\n\t\t\t\t\n \n \n   \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLast edited by Mark B(85); 16-03-11 at 01:46.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n   \n \n \n \n      Reply With Quote    \n \n \n \n\t    16-03-11 12:00   #7  \n        Tessa H(88) \n   Parent Supporter, Health Visitor\nDisclaimer   \n \n \n  \tJoin Date\n\tSep 2008\n\tPosts\n\t2,361\n\n \n \n \n     \n\t\t\t\t\tHi Mark...oh that is good news  thank you so much for coming back to let us know.\n \n\nI can see that this must be quite an anxious time for you and your wife and given the complexities of your wife's pregnancy I wonder if it would be best to ask your medical team the answers to those questions???\n \n\nThey will have all the information available and relevant to you wife's medical history, and that of your babies, and will be best placed to offer accurate answers.\n \n\nI'm sure you will be keeping a list of things to ask at that consultant appointment next Monday Mark, so perhaps add these to that list and please do come back and let us know how that goes if you want to.\n \n\nTessa\n\t\t\t\t\n \n \n  \n \n \n\n \n \n      Reply With Quote    \n \n \n \n\t    26-05-11 00:42   #8  \n     Mark B(85) \n   Hi, I'm New   \n \n \n  \tJoin Date\n\tMar 2011\n\tPosts\n\t4\n\n \n \n \n   \n\t\t\tUpdate\n\t\t\n   \n\t\t\t\t\tAll,\n \n\nI would like to provide an update.  The past 3 months have been hectic.  Christine is now 26+1 and both babies are doing as well as can be   We have found out that they are both boys.\n \n\nBaby A still has a ruptured sack and appears to be smaller that average; about 3 weeks behind gestation.  Baby B is growing typically.\n \n\nI am absolutely amazed that we have been able to get this far.  3 months ago, it did not look like we would be here.  Christine is now been admitted in hospital for the two weeks.  We are fortunate to have a level 3 perinatal NICU in the area.  They wanted her to be admitted in case the babies needed to be delivered.\n \n\nFor those that are going through this, keep faith.  We do not know how this will turn out, but our babies now have a chance at being part of this world and for that, we are thankful.\n \n\nThanks for all the help and I will keep this thread updated.\n\t\t\t\t\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n      Reply With Quote    \n \n \n \n\t    26-05-11 01:48   #9  \n     Claire M(1284) \n   Member   \n \n \n  \tJoin Date\n\tMar 2010\n\tPosts\n\t435\n\n \n \n \n     \n\t\t\t\t\tso pleased that things are looking up  you mentioned about 'keeping faith' is that in God or just in situation? well whatever sounds like things are better than you'd thought.\n \n\nfriends of mine from our church went through an experiance about 2 yrs ago where their unborn twins were suffering from 'twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome' (google it), and there was a high percentage chance one or both would die. However (after lots prayer), they are now doing really well and are about 21mths old  !!! Miracles DO happen yay!\n \n\nI'm no expert, but i'm sure you are not that far off the stage where the drs COULD induce birth if NECESSARY. not ideal, but babies survive outside womb earlier and earlier these days.

At first there is something unaccountably odd about her voice as she describes her childhood growing up at Hailsham, which in many ways sounds like an idyllic boarding school. But with the realisation of the true purpose and scope of their lives, comes an understanding of Kathy and of the young men and women who she describes. Ishiguro captures with admirable delicacy the personality traits of people that have never had the opportunity to encounter and engage with the real world, whose development has been stunted and who have learned their behaviour from watching TV shows. \n\nAt first the characters seem implausibly well-behaved. Even given their training and isolation, is it likely that these kids would never smoke or binge because they were forbidden? And when, let out at sixteen, would they tamely follow a prescribed future as if on tramlines? They are polite, punctual, obedient, brain-washable young men and women, that strain to do their essays and their art work, aim to please, yearn for praise, never swear and put their toys away in their little chests under their beds. Or is it that their clear purpose in life and prescribed future, like many rigorous belief systems, makes them conveniently pliable? \n\nPutting aside the improbability of the whole concept of the novel, Ishiguro’s book works brilliantly as an exploration of what it means to be human. Throughout history, terrible things have been done in the belief that a race or class of people are less than human and can justifiably be treated like animals. Despite being ‘farmed’, the men and women Kathy describes display very human emotions, including love and jealousy, as well as their touching and authentic need to know their own origins.\n\nAt a time when the possibilities of science seem infinite, the novel questions the extent to which societies are willing to deceive themselves and exploit others for their own ends and who, ultimately, will be responsible for arbitrating and upholding what is right. \n\nIshuguro never slows the pace of his novel by using three syllables where one will do, tension builds imperceptibly to a very elegant crescendo, and he spares the reader nothing of pity or reproach. NEVER LET ME GO is a subtly sinister yet moving and thought-provoking novel. \n\n\nPaula McMaster\n\n\n\nPublished by Faber & Faber, 304pp.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\tYour name:  \n\n\tYour comment: \n\n\t \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\nRecommend this site to a friend\n\n\n\n\n\n",

An alien interpreter viewing our discussions might think of them as completely nonsensical, but that itself doesn't mean there would be no information in them.\n\nLSV is right in one sense - information can be seen as being about generation.  The Kolmogorov analysis of the information content of a particular string is to look at it in terms of the length of the (formal) procedure needed to create that string.  In this respect, Natman's example is poorly chosen, since \"fyoreolaou\" does not have the same structure as \"youareafool\".  In fact, on a language-independent formal procedure, it appears slightly less mathematically random than its engl-ish counterpart, in that the letter 'o' appears with a certain amount of regularity.  In addition, in a procedure that can take the syntactic representation of english words as basic, the english string is going to be much easier to generate.\n\nOn the other hand, with this analysis in mind, it seems that different notions of \"formal procedure\" result in different valuations of information content.  Furthermore, there is a very strong likelihood of overdetermination if we're not careful.  Pete Rollins gives a cute example of exactly this kind of thing with his \"godisnowhere\" (I've ignored his contextual point, which I think is that little ambiguities like that are required in giving a full account of divinity and the social impact thereof).\n\nThe basic worry in giving a contextually neutral notion of information at the human scale is that of having a set of agreed fundamental principles of semantic interpretation and generation.  If one wants to follow Chomsky in thinking that all language follows a common grammatical and mathematical structure, and then think that this structure is a mirror of the structure of the real world itself, then perhaps the notion of information content in question is clear and unambiguous - it is just whatever it is in the world that you're talking about.  So it's aspects of the creator or the grounding elements of physics, depending on the Theist/Reductivist divide.\n\nBut the Mathematical notion of information does not care one way or the other as to whether the structure it is talking about is \"correct\" or even \"in use\".  It is scale-independent.  These are properties that determine the protocol of information exchange.  Information is more abstract than that, and simply ties packets and codings together.  In particular, information does not imply compressibility.\n\nThe thought is that even \"@*!\" has information content as a string, albeit exactly that information content contained in \"012\" with a translation mapping 0->@, 1->*, 2->!.  Why do we say this?  It's so that we can identify the things that are being interpreted.  Some person X for whom this string has a basic generation principle may derive content from this string that we do not.  We could perhaps have done better in transmitting that content to them by saying something with the same meaning with fewer characters.  But that can't impact on \"@*!\"'s being the informative token that it is - otherwise, a thing's interpretation would simply be identical to its syntactic tokening, and that strikes me as just crazy.\n\nIntelligence is fundamentally about being able to reflect on tricks like compression by considering the notions of process and generation involved.  I think it is entirely appropriate to look at them (particularly qua \"proof\" in logic and mathematics) as involved in our structural analysis of the world, and I don't think we can do good science without it.  But the core point to take away here is that intelligence is a higher order notion than information, with the latter just being what the former operates over rather than something that has an ontological dependence on the former.\n\n\nNow I think I can address LSV's point.  LSV, your argument is that the information content in genetic coding cannot be interpreted relative to a coding structre that has nothing else to fall back on than physics and chemistry, because it is too mathematically random.  This is random in the sense of there being no non-trivial compression algorithm.  In other words, it has no interpretation-level identities with any other physical processes, and (you conclude) has a distinctly intelligent character, clashing with any attempt at physicalistic reduction.\n\nBut for the conclusion to go through, you need to demonstrate that the lack of identity with other processes at the interpretive level means that there is no generation algorithm in purely physial or chemical terms.  I don't think this will work.  It's one thing to say \"it's not like anything else\", but you assume in your reply to PK that you can jump the gap from \"not typically physical\" to \"physically irreducible\".  I can see why that jump might intuitively seem natural, in that we might want to think that everything that happens physically does so as a matter of maximum generality, and that everything that occurs once occurs again.\n\nYet I think an entirely reasonable response might be as follows: There are identity conditions at both levels.  There is a physical explanation at the reducing physical level, while self-identity is an acceptable condition at the reduced interpretive level because there are non-circular identity conditions at the physical.  You're only ruling out self-identity at the interpretive level because you are being skeptical about the physicalistic identity conditions - this certainly constitutes a challenge to any possibility that you as an interpreter can give a non-regressive account of the information content of genetic molecules, but not of all interpretations.\n\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, a generation algorithm is an entirely plausible option - the Miller-Urey experiments show how the basic proteins form as a general principle, and all that remains is some chemical explanation for how these can be combined to form a polymer.  This explanation needn't be a guarantee that they will always do so - it just needs to posit some way in which they can in order for the information content to be deterined, even if that information content is so dense as to seem incredibly probabilistically unlikely.\n\nIn summary, I think what you've erred in your argument by depending on the information/interpretation gap being closed by a prior constraint on the domain of information, when the constraint you need only affects the domain of interpretation.\n  \n\n  Complain about this comment (Comment number 103)\n \n \n\t Comment number 104.\n  At 14:55  4th Apr 2011, Beecefromsuff wrote:     Afternoon all, still awaiting by intelligent and considered response to appear, in the mean time.....whatbout-yee aul hands!!\n  \n\n  Complain about this comment (Comment number 104)\n \n \n\t Comment number 105.\n  At 21:58  4th Apr 2011, logica_sine_vanitate wrote:     PaulR - \n\nThanks for your thoughts concerning information.\n\nThe fundamental question is this: can the information content of DNA be nothing more than an emergent property of the laws of nature operating in and on matter?  The answer to that question is clearly 'no'.  The genetic code is mathematically 'random' in the sense that it is algorithmically incompressible, but it also possesses specified complexity in that only certain specific sequences code for viable functioning proteins, and the wrong sequences result in failure of protein synthesis.  Therefore the genetic code is 'semantic information' not merely 'syntactic', the latter being the case with what we, in everyday parlance, would refer to as a 'random' sequence (monkey generated information).  \n\nThe problem with non-semantic algorithmically incompressible information is that any 'useful' information that happens to appear in the sequence is 'undone' by the presence of the non-useful information.  Non-useful information is not merely redundant, it is also largely semantically destructive (this can be seen in a random sequence of letters that may contain some 'English' looking words, but whatever meaning those 'words' may have has been undermined by the lack of context and the gibberish surrounding them).  Therefore junk information has to be screened out (and by 'junk' I am not referring to non-coding DNA, which may have a biological function).  How would this be possible by a purely chemical process?  Screening involves scanning against a template of target information.  In other words, the perfect semantic key has to first exist, against which the randomly generated information has to be scanned.  This is why Dawkins' weasel programme is such a fallacy, with its 'target letters' procedure (in fact, one wonders why he even needs to generate his line of Hamlet, when it already exists in the form of his target letters!!)\n\nSo we need algorithmically incompressible semantic information.  If this is an emergent property of matter, then, based on the principle of the conservation of information, the structure of matter has to contain this information, otherwise where did it come from?  But the laws of nature operate according to algorithms - a good example being the iterations observed in the formation of a crystal.  Algorithmically incompressible information, by definition, cannot emerge by such means.\n\nFurthermore, the sequence of the genetic code (and I am not talking here about the pairing of bases but the sequence of the genome) has to be indeterminate for it to function as a code.  But this would not be the case if the sequence was determined merely by chemical affinities between the nucleotide bases of DNA (and RNA), in the same way that the sequence of the symbols of printed language would be overwhelmingly narrow and predictable if determined by the molecular structure of paper and ink alone.  The 'randomness' (i.e. informational indeterminacy) of the letters on a printed page is entirely separate from the molecular structure of paper and ink (and, in fact, that structure is not indeterminate anyway).  An example of 'information' created purely by matter would be the shape of a droplet of ink on a piece of blotting paper.  Its shape and size would be formed by physics and chemistry alone.  But if I were to write this sentence on that piece of blotting paper, I would be introducing another influence - intelligence - which would override (to some extent) the deterministic influence of the material properties of paper and ink.  The information content of what I had written could not have been created by the informational content of the molecular structure of the paper and ink, since the algorithmic nature of the latter has a smaller information content than the former.\n\nThe laws of nature alone contain a different kind of information from that contained in the genetic code.  Therefore the information that governs life must have originated from a source other than matter, and the only conceivable source of such algorithmically incompressible semantic information is intelligence.\n  \n\n  Complain about this comment (Comment number 105)\n \n \n\t Comment number 106.\n  At 00:27  5th Apr 2011, grokesx wrote:     @LSV\n\nJust a quickie.

In addition, just like life, letters can be removed and even rearranged (to represent mutations), and if the new string has more sense (whatever that means), then it propagates further generations.\n\nAfter many, many sequences, you'd quite easily have a long, comprehensible, string. All without the input of intelligence. It might -seem- that intelligence is guiding it, but in effect, non-sensical strings of letters (representing genetic non-viability) are prevented from contributing to further generations.\n\nOf course, five minutes of research on any of his points would show that LSV's stance is severly flawed.

I remember reading re Lovelock's Gaia, that life optimizes or perhaps maximises entropy and entropy drives evolution. That, entropy as condensation is achieved in nature by biological organisms.Physicist Herbert Froehlich says that this is pervasive in nature because all plants and animals are living matter -made of water & other biolmolecules equipped with electrical dipoles which react to external stimuli, & can behave like the atomic equivalent of a laser, amplifying signals and encoding information.\n\n Froehlich says that through this they can \"remember\" an external stimulus. For example, plants capturing light through photosynthesis is \"evidence of quantum coherence in a living system\"\nSo if consiousness is a pervasive process in nature, Physicist Nick Herbert,also says that consciousness/the mind is also as fundamental a component of the Universe as particles & forces.

There was plenty of stuff on sorting and fibonacci numbers and binary trees, but of the conservation of information, nay the principle of conservation of information, zip. Just to clarify, my dictionary defines principle in a number of ways: a generalisation that is accepted as true which can be used in reasoning for example, or a rule or law concerning a natural phenomenon or function of a complex system. So, what would a law of conservation of information state? I can think of one that may be true, but not particularly useful, and that would be \"information can be conserved.\"  We could set it alongside other principles, \"information can be decreased\" and \"information can be increased.\" \n\nJust in case my memory is playing me false, I searched through the MIT Introduction to Algorithms, all 1202 pages, for the phrase \"conservation of information\". Nuffink. Also \"preservation of information\". Nada. In information theory, it plays no role, although I did find it cropping up once in the field of intuitionist mathematics, but I don't think that's what you are thinking of, given your apparently neo-platonist views of reality.\n\nSo we are back with Dembski again. He came up with the \"Law of Conservation of Information\", defining it thus: \"natural causes can only transmit CSI but never originate it.\" CSI, naturally, is complex specified information. So this principle or law is a law made up by Demski about a concept, also made up by Dembski which no one outside intelligent design or creationist circles have shown any interest in.\n\nSo, in answer to #111 - I will stop making remarks about Dembski when you stop passing his lonely furrowings off as mainstream science, maths or information theory.\n  \n\n  Complain about this comment (Comment number 112)\n \n \n\t Comment number 113.\n  At 00:37  6th Apr 2011, grokesx wrote:     @Ryan\n\nSorry, but there's no woo like quantum woo.\n  \n\n  Complain about this comment (Comment number 113)\n \n \n\t Comment number 114.\n  At 08:33  6th Apr 2011, Natman wrote:     grokesx,\n\nAnd, as it has been clearly demonstrated on Demski's own blog, no one can seem to either define what complex specified information is, nor how to calculate it.\n\nIt's basically 'I cannot possibly understand how genetic transcription works, therefore, goddit'.\n\nLSV,\n\nDo you agree with the concept of common descent?\n  \n\n  Complain about this comment (Comment number 114)\n \n \n\t Comment number 115.\n  At 17:48  6th Apr 2011, _Ryan_ wrote:     grokesx, I'm curious as to whether you think that branch of Physics is woo, or Froehlich is woo, or that you don't agree with the context it's in.

You've failed 5 times in a row now.\n\n\"Creationist sources. It makes not a scrap of difference which organisation has put out a paper.\"\n\nThat was not my main point against that paper. While the source of the paper you put up was pathetic, my main objection against it was that it was irrelevant to the issue I had put to you. You had made the claim of irreducible complexity for replicating biological molecules. I showed you an example of a self-replicating molecule that is not part of an IR system but rather self-replicates copies of itself from parts in isolation. You made the claim, I hold up a counter-example that kills your claim.\n\n\"Any more points I missed?\"\n\nYes, the Specified Complexity bit you brought up is nothing but creationist jargon that they themselves can't even define sharply or calculate.\n\n\"The correlation between adherence to the philosophy of materialism and levels of education. Well, it seems that the statistics are saying different things.\"\n\nThey do, but you need to accept that the different sources are not equal. Mine (supporting the overwhelming negative correlation between scientific achievement and faith) covers a polling of the members of the National Academy of Sciences, to which 70% of the members responded. The questioning is specified, as is all other info required to rerun the poll if someone wanted to verify its accuracy. Your source is a web page of a sister publication of the Christian Science Monitor that provides no info whatever on the how and what they did.\n\n\"Now that I have responded to you, what about the penultimate paragraph of this post?\"\nreferring to\n\"If you think I am just ignoring evidence, then please provide just ONE piece of evidence that PROVES that your view of reality is correct. I am not asking for hypotheses that can show that certain events COULD HAVE happened. I am asking for PROOF as to what DID actually happen.\"\n\nI presented evidence to you for abiogenesis previously, but you chose to comment on the one bit where you thought you had a good rebuttal (the Urey-Miller experiment, your rebuttal was hollow) and ignored all the rest. Why don't you read what was presented to you rather than ask for evidence again?\n\n\"And by the way, could I ask you why you keep chickening out of answering philosophical questions?\"\n\nBecause your questions about philosophy are nothing but the application of double standards. You never worry about the presuppositions in the interpretation of evidence as long as you think the evidence points in your favour. Then when I show you wrong again (as I done on 95% of the issues we've sparred on recently) you can't handle the defeat of your goddunnit ideas. And so you seek to change the rules in mid-game. When I explain why your evidence is wrong you promptly abandon your interest in arguing from evidence and do another pseudo-philosohical runaway again.\n\nHappy running from scientific evidence LSV.\n  \n\n  Complain about this comment (Comment number 118)\n \n \n\t Comment number 119.\n  At 21:02  6th Apr 2011, PeterKlaver wrote:     Catching up on the second page of this thread, I see a new level of desperation on the part of LSV.\n\n\"Well, your mate Prof. D. obviously believes in it, since he cannot create a new line of Hamlet by natural means, but has to 'discover' it, since it already exists in target form.\"\n\nHey why not, claim that the author of many books that explain the complexity of life through evolution actually believes in the unscientific creationist invention of the conservation of information.

I have said many time  that I *incline* towards it, but my arguments with you in this area centre around your misunderstanding – or wilful mangling – of the difference between methodological naturalism and philosophical naturalism/materialism. My atheism (and I will repeat for the hard of understanding, that is a-theism, ie “without theism ” and not necessarily a-deism) derives from the lack of evidence for the claims made by  religions that posit a personal god that intervenes in the world.\n\n“...As for his 'logic' argument: well, if logic doesn't validate itself, then what does?? And on what basis do we validate the thing that validates logic...”\n\nAh, you see the problem. Does it not remind you of anything?  Is it not self refuting? Or one of those paradoxes you so glibly dismiss as semantic absurdities but that proved to be an integral part of the realm of meta-mathematics and meta-logic in the 20th Century that seemed to have passed you by.  Anyway, you're the one making the claim, the task is yours. \n\nThe thing is, the rationalist v empiricist debate which we are sort of having, fizzled out when the rationalists realised they weren't 100% rationalists and the empiricists realised they weren't 100% empiricists. I'm simplifying greatly, as ever, but it happened, I think, around the time when the really clever people started to realise that to extend the cognitive map of reality we hold in our collective heads, we need to go and explore the reality. There's only so much you can learn, after all, by studying the calligraphy of the bits that say, “There be dragons.” \n\nSo the natural philosophers became scientists and explored the territory and the philosophers argued about the map, with many of them confusing it with the territory itself, leading to endlessly entertaining flavours of woo. \n  \n\n  Complain about this comment (Comment number 128)\n \n \n\t Comment number 129.\n  At 01:05  8th Apr 2011, grokesx wrote:     \"A curious demand\" not a \"curious question to demand\".

Hunt didn't finish this version until 1857, ten years after it was begun.\n\n                Both paintings were inspired by John Keat's poem of the same name. The poem was based upon the ancient belief that if a young woman prayed to St Agnes on the eve of her feast, then she would see in her sleep the face of the man she was destined to marry. Madeleine and Porphyro, two lovers who have been kept from each other's arms by the jealous rivalry between their two families, are the principal figures of the poem and the painting. On St Agnes Eve, Porphyro gained access to Madeleine's bedroom, pretending at first to be a vision. After revealing his true identity he persuaded her to leave her father's house and marry him.\n\n                Hunt's painting illustrates the penultimate verse of the poem, in which the two lovers are described as escaping. The following lines from Keats's poem were included in the catalogue of the 1848 Royal Academy Exhibition when the larger version was first shown:\n\n                'They glide, like phantoms into the wide hall;\n\n                  Like phantoms, to the iron porch they glide;\n\n                  Where lay the Porter, in uneasy sprawl,\n\n                  With a huge empty flagon by his side:\n\n                  The wakeful bloodhound rose, and shook his hide,\n\n                  But his sagacious eye an inmate owns;\n\n                  By one, and one, the bolts full easy slide:-\n\n                  The chains lie silent on the footworn stones\n\n            The key turns, and the door upon its hinges groans.'\n\n                Nobody else is awake in the poem, rather 'In all the house was heard no human sound'. However, Hunt has increased the tension of the moment of escape by adding feasting guests of Madeleine's father to the scene. These debauched partygoers are significantly placed on the left hand side (traditionally the side associated with evil), in contrast to the goodness and piety of the couple escaping through a door on the right (traditionally the side of righteousness).\n\n                Unlike the larger painting this smaller version uses more lurid pigment, especially in the clothing of the main characters. Hunt finished the picture after his first visit to the Holy Land, during which his colour had become markedly brighter.

Brock (FINN)\n\n\n \n\n\n\nTODAY’S TOP STORY:\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOIL OPERATORS SEEK CO-OPERATION AND SWAP IDEAS\n\n\n \n\n\n\nBy J. Brock (FINN)\n\n\n \n\n\n\nNow that the oil operators are back in London they will still be meeting together on a regular basis to swap ideas and to exchange relevant information.  Subjects like logistics, drilling and legal information not only were shared this week but have been and will be shared in the UK by all exploration companies operating in the Falklands.  The latest round of meetings in the Falklands helped to keep contact with a wide variety of government officials and advisors who will be meeting each company separately and collectively in the run-up to drilling in the North, East and South Falklands Basins.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThanks to the high price of crude everyone now can ask for more money and the rig market, already tight, can also demand more money.  As previously reported in HDR the tight rig market means that at $85.00 per barrel the exploration rigs are being used for exploitation and not exploration.  Though the ideal situation for drilling happened in 1998 when crude prices were slightly under $10.00 per barrel, cheap rig rental and drilling costs are a pipe dream nowadays. \n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe potential for huge oil finds is well documented around the Falklands, unlike the North Sea that does not have future potential for huge deposits of several billion barrels.  With better technology depths around the Falklands aren’t that much of a risk, either.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCo-operation is needed if the companies are to share resources and complete the drilling phase of exploration on a cost-effective basis.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCRUDE PRICES:  Monday, 15 October 2007\n\n\n \n\n\n\nLight Sweet Crude traded at $$86.13 up $2.44 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Brent Crude was trading at $82.23 up $2.24 on London’s ICE Futures Market.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nANALYSIS:\n\n\n \n\n\n\nTurkey’s shelling of Northern Iraq caused enough fear of supply disruption that crude prices closed at a record high today.  Another “fearful” story deals with a gas pipeline fire in Nigeria.  That didn’t help steady crude prices either. It won’t take long for people, already strapped for money to cut gasoline and heating fuel expenses.  People with more resources will seek alternative sources of energy while poorer people will be faced with the choice to heat their home one day, and eat another day.  Either way, demand will go down and with that, the price.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nTHE MARKETS:\n\n\n \n\n\n\nFTSE 100: 6,644.30 down 86.21, FTSE250: 11,439.90 down 136.41, SmallCap:  3,856.30 down 27.99\n\n\n \n\n\n\nDJI: 13,984.80 down 108.28, NASDAQ: 2,780.05 down 25.63, S&P500: 1,548.71 down 13.09\n\n\n \n\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS:\n\n\n \n\n\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell Plc shut natural gas pumping at one of its Nigerian fields following a fire on a pipeline in the south of the country in the Utorogu-Ughelli gas condensate pipeline. Shell had to declare force majeure on deliveries to the nation's gas pipeline network.             \n\n\n \n\n\n\nREGIONAL DEVELOPMENTS:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n(Brazil)\n\n\n \n\n\n\nFrom a press release:\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPetrobras has announced that the Piranema field, 25 km off the coast of Sergipe, started producing oil in deep Northeastern Brazil waters. The Piranema oil, of excellent quality, at 44º API, is the lightest oil produced in deep waters in Brazil.  This type of oil is essential for lubricant production. With operations started in Piranema, Other Northeastern Brazilian states could also start exploring oil at greater depths.  The new field will initially produce 10,000 barrels of oil per day, a figure that may reach 30,000 in 2008. When it is at its full capacity, this field will boost Sergipe’s oil production by 60%. Chartered from Norwegian corporation Sevan Production AS, this platform is an FPSO-type unit (which produces, stores and offloads oil).  The new platform has unprecedented technical characteristics: the round hull, unlike the traditional floating systems, is more versatile and stable, rendering it safer for the operations. Chartered for an 11-year term, during the first phase of the project it will be anchored in the northern portion of the field, at a water depth of 1,090 meters, and will be connected to six wells.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nRELEVANT SHARE PRICES: \n\n\n \n\n\n\nTLW: 625.50 down 2.00, DES:  29.50 down 0.25, FOGL:  142.00 up 0.50, RKH:  49.50 unchanged, BOR: 37.00 unchanged, PRE:  14.50 up 0.50, GBP:  10.25 up 0.25, GPK: 423.50 unchanged, BLT 1829.00 down 49.00\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\nThis article is the Property and Copyright of Falkland Islands News Network.\n\t<< First <  Previous\tArticle 1 of \nwithin Mineral Resources\tNext > Last >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t       Powered by NIC.SH\tCopyright © 1993-2011 SARTMA.com\tDesign by CrownNet       \n\n\n\n\n\n",

Today the column informs us of a story about.....\n\n'two Welsh politicians who were barracked by war veterans when they continued to loudly hold an unrelated conversation during a remembrance procession through their constituency last week? A British Legion veteran felt forced to yell at them, telling the pair \"You're walking around like you're in Asda and you just carried on talking\"! When one of the politicians attempted to reply, the elderly man shouted \"Shut your bl***y mouth - just for once in your life and listen to someone else, and you may just learn something.\" The politician was left shaking, while the colleague was left to placate the veterans..'.\n\nPlease note that blame for the awful 'split infinitive' rests entirely with Spin Doctor. Not sure why there should be such coyness about naming the individuals concerned. I was told about this incident soon after it happened (though not the actual words supposedly used) - which was during the remembrance procession in Newtown, in Montgomeryshire. I'm told there were 300 people on the street at the time. I'd accepted an invitation to join the procession in Welshpool, or I might have witnessed the incident myself. I'd concluded that the story damaged the dignity of Remembrance Sunday, and had not repeated it to anyone - so I must admit to being a tad surprised to see it appearing in the WoS. I'm not going to allow any names to appear in comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nGlyn Davies\n\n\nat\n14:52\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\ncomments:\n        \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonetired\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nGlyn: be careful about such posts!

The \nreport also sets out how Non-Domestic Rates (NDR) will be distributed to police \nauthorities. \n \n \n 3  \n  LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE REPORT 2008-2009 \n(Final Settlement - Police Authorities) \n \n \n \n Chapter 2.  Main Proposals \n \nRevenue Support Grant \n2.1 The amount of RSG for police authorities in 2008-09 is £71.287 million.  \n2.2 Under the system of distribution determined in this report, the amount of RSG to be \npaid to an individual police authority is determined by its SSA, taking account of the \namount of NDR it will receive and also of the amount of council tax it is assumed to \nbe able to raise. Section 2 of this report describes how this process works.  \n \n \nDistributable amount: Non Domestic Rates \n \n2.3 The distributable amount of NDR available for authorities in Wales for 2008-09 is \n£868m (which is referred to as E in Chapter 4).  Therefore, the amount available for \npolice authorities is £86.8 million. The basis upon which NDR is distributed to police \nauthorities is described in Chapter 4.  \n \n 4  \n  LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE REPORT 2008-2009 \n(Final Settlement - Police Authorities) \n \nSECTION TWO: POLICE AUTHORITIES \n \n \nChapter 3.  Calculation of the amount of RSG for each police authority \n \n3.1 This chapter specifies the basis on which Welsh Ministers will distribute the amount \nof RSG to be paid to police authorities in 2008-09.  Grant will be distributed so that if \neach police authority were to have a budget requirement at the level of its Standard \nSpending Assessment (SSA) then, subject to certain qualifications as set out in the \nExplanatory Notes (Annex 3), all police authorities could set broadly the same \ncouncil tax for dwellings listed in the same valuation band. \n \n3.2 The method by which SSAs for police authorities have been calculated is set out in \nChapter 5.  The calculation makes use of information reflecting the demographic, \nphysical, economic and social characteristics of each area.  \n \n3.3 In order to calculate the amount of grant to be paid to each police authority, Welsh \nMinisters will first calculate the SSA for that authority.  For this purpose, it is \nassumed that there is no use of, or contribution to, financial reserves. \nThe RSG entitlement for each police authority is calculated by applying the formula: \n \n A – B – (C x D) \n \nWhere: \n \nA is the SSA for the police authority as calculated in accordance with Chapter 5; \n  \nB is the police authority’s share of the distributable amount from the non-domestic \nrating account as calculated in accordance with Chapter 4; \n \nC is the standard tax element for the police authority as specified in paragraph 3.4; \nand \n \nD is the police authority tax base for RSG purposes for the police authority area as \nspecified in Table 3.1. \n \n \n 5  \n  LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE REPORT 2008-2009 \n(Final Settlement - Police Authorities) \n \nStandard tax elements for calculating RSG entitlements \n \n3.4 Welsh Ministers will distribute RSG so as to enable (subject to the qualifications \nspecified in Annex 1) broadly the same council tax, known as Council Tax for \nStandard Spending, to be set for dwellings listed in the same valuation band in all \nareas.  The appropriate “standard tax element” for police authorities is £82.13. \n \n \nCouncil tax base for distributing RSG \n \n3.5 Each council is required to calculate its council tax base in accordance with \nregulations made under section 33(5) of the Local Government Finance Act 1992 \n(these are the Local Authorities (Calculation of Council Tax Base) (Wales) \n1\nRegulations 1995 (as amended)TP F FPT). The calculation of the council tax base for the \npurpose of distributing RSG is made having regard to council tax base figures \nsupplied to Welsh Ministers by councils on Form CT1 on or before 1 December \n2007. \n3.6 The council tax base figures for the purpose of distributing RSG are set out in Table \n3.1.  \n \nTable 3.1 Council tax base: number of band D equivalent properties for 2008-09 \n \nPolice authorities  \n Dyfed-Powys 210,613 \n Gwent 208,823 \n North Wales 279,631 \n South Wales 469,522 \nWales total  1,168,589 \nNote:  Figures shown in the above table are rounded versions of those actually used. \nNote: An explanation of Band D equivalent properties is given in Annex 2 – Explanatory Notes.  \n \n1\nTP PT See the Local Authorities (Calculation of Council Tax Base) (Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 1999 SI \n1999/2935 (W27) and the Local Authorities (Calculation of Council Tax Base) and Council Tax \n(Prescribed Classes of Dwellings) (Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2004. \n 6  \n  LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE REPORT 2008-2009 \n(Final Settlement - Police Authorities) \n \n \nChapter 4.  Calculation of the amount of non-domestic rates for each police \nauthority \n4.1   This chapter specifies the basis on which Welsh Ministers will distribute among \npolice authorities the appropriate share of the distributable amount from the non-\ndomestic rating account for 2008-09. It will be distributed pro rata to adult \npopulation in each police authority's area, using the formula below: \n \n (E x 10%)x  UFU \n                           G  \n \n where: \n \nE is the distributable amount specified in paragraph 2.3 of this Report; \nF is the resident population aged 18 years and over at 30 June 2006 for the \npolice authority area, as derived from estimates by the Registrar General and \nspecified in Table 4.1; \nG is the population of Wales on the same basis as that in respect of F above.  \n \nTable 4.1 Resident population aged 18 years and over at 30 June 2006  \n \nPrescribed \n \nfigure \n  \n Dyfed Powys \n398,700 \n Gwent \n431,700 \n North Wales \n532,400 \n South Wales \n962,200 \nWales total \n2,325,000 \n \n 7  \n  LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE REPORT 2008-2009 \n(Final Settlement - Police Authorities) \n \n \nChapter 5.  Calculation of the SSA for each police authority  \n \n \n5.1 The main elements of the formula for calculating the SSA of police authority are \ndecided by the Home Secretary as part of a common formula covering Wales and \nEngland.  Welsh Ministers are responsible for the capital financing element of the \nformula. \n \n5.2 The main determinant of the police SSAs is the projected resident population.  Cost \nadjustments are built into this formula for the socio-economic and other \ncharacteristics of police force areas and for differences in the costs of provision \nbetween areas.   \n  \n5.3 The indicators used to determine the SSA for each police authority, and their \ndefinitions, are set out in Section 3, Annex 1.  \n \n 8  \n  LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE REPORT 2008-2009 \n(Final Settlement - Police Authorities) \n \n \nUSECTION THREE - ANNEXES TO THE REPORT \n \n \nAnnex 1 Indicators used in the calculation of police authorities’ SSAs \n \nAnnex 2  Glossary and Explanatory Notes \n \nAnnex 3 Statutory Basis for the Report \n \n \n 9  \n  LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE REPORT 2008-2009 \n(Final Settlement - Police Authorities) \n \nANNEX 1: INDICATORS AND VALUES USED IN THE CALCULATION OF POLICE \nAUTHORITIES’ SSAs \n \n \nUnless otherwise stated, data used to construct indicators for the calculation of standard \nspending assessments (SSAs) are those that were available to the Home Secretary on \n1 October 2007 concerning the area of each constituent authority of each police \nauthority relevant to the calculation of specific SSA elements. \n \nConstituent authorities for this purpose, and in the definition of population density below, \nare the councils whose areas are contained within the area of the police authority. \n \nData used to construct the indicators have been adjusted, where relevant, to take \naccount of the alterations to police areas in Wales made under the Police Areas (Wales) \nOrder 1995 (SI 1995/2864). \n 10  \n  LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE REPORT 2008-2009 \n(Final Settlement - Police Authorities) \n \nCALCULATION OF SSA \nThe total SSA is the sum of the current and non-current SSAs. \n \nCALCULATION OF CURRENT SSA \n \nThe greater part of the amount of grant to be paid to each police authority is calculated \nin accordance with the principal needs-based formula shown below. \n \nThe main determinant in the principal formula is the projected resident population.

These bands range from band A up to \nband I and the police authority tax bills for each band vary according to a set of \nmultipliers.  These multipliers vary from sixth ninths for a band A property to two and \nthree ninths for a band I property while the multiplier for a band D property is one.  The \nnumber of band D equivalent properties in an authority is the total number of domestic \ndwellings expressed in terms of their relation to band D. For example, one band H \nproperty is equivalent to two band D properties, because it pays twice as much police \nauthority tax. \n \nCouncil Tax Base of an area is equal to the number of band D equivalent properties, \nafter adjustment for discounts and exemptions.  Discounts are available to people who \nlive alone, and to owners of homes that are not anyone’s main home.   Police authority \nTax is not charged for certain properties, known as exempt properties, such as those \nlived in only by students. The description of how the tax base is calculated and used in \nthe calculation of RSG see paragraph 3.5 in section 2 of this Report. \n \nCouncil Tax for Standard Spending is the level of police authority tax for a band D \nproperty which would be charged in all parts of Wales if all police authorities and police \nauthorities spent at the level of their SSA.  This figure is used to work out how the \namount of RSG payable to police authorities should be shared among them, and \nsimilarly how the amount of RSG payable to police authorities should be shared out. \n \nNon-Domestic Rates are the property tax paid by businesses. All business rates are \npaid into a central pool administered by Welsh Ministers for redistribution to police \nauthorities and police authorities. \n \nQualifications affecting council tax calculation: RSG is distributed to enable each \npolice authority to set broadly the same police authority tax for dwellings listed in the \nsame valuation band.  For each council or police authority, it is assumed that the 2007-\n08 council tax base used for RSG distribution is calculated in accordance with the \nrelevant secondary legislation (The Local Authorities (Calculation of Council Tax Base) \n(Wales) Regulations 1995 (S.I. 1995/2561), as amended by the Local Authorities \n(Calculation of Council Tax Base) (Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 1999 \n(S.I.1999/2935).  Secondly, it is assumed that the application of section 35 of the Local \nGovernment Finance Act 1992 (“special items or the purposes of section 34”) (as \namended) will result in the same council tax for dwellings listed in the same valuation \nband across the whole of a police authority’s area. \n \n 20  \n  LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE REPORT 2008-2009 \n(Final Settlement - Police Authorities) \n \nReceiving Authorities include police authorities. RSG is paid to each receiving \nauthority. \n \nSSAs  (Standard Spending Assessments) are notional assessments for RSG \ndistribution purposes of each police authority's need to spend on revenue services, \nexcluding specific grants.  \nStandard tax element is the portion of the council tax for standard spending \nattributable to each class of receiving authority.  It is a common figure for each authority \nwithin a class.  The two classes of authorities in Wales are councils and police \nauthorities. \n 21  \n  LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE REPORT 2008-2009 \n(Final Settlement - Police Authorities) \n \n  \nANNEX 3: STATUTORY BASIS FOR THE REPORT     \n \n1. The Local Government Finance report is made under section 84G (Local \ngovernment finance reports) of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 (“the 1988 \nAct”) as amended by the Local Government Act 2003 (“the 2003 Act”).  The report \nwill have effect for the financial year 2008-09 if it is duly approved by resolution of \nthe National Assembly.  \n \nAmount of RSG and redistributed non domestic rates \n \n2. Section 84F (Determination of grant) of the 1988 Act requires Welsh Ministers to \ndetermine the amount of RSG for each financial year and how much it proposes to \npay to receiving police authorities.  \n \nBasis of distributing RSG \n \n3. Section 40 and paragraph 1 of Schedule 2 to the 2003 Act inserted section 84G into \nthe 1988 Act. Section 84G requires Welsh Ministers to make a report setting out its \ndeterminations under section 84F and to specify the basis on which RSG is to be \ndistributed between receiving authorities. \n \nRedistributed Non Domestic Rates \n \n4. Paragraph 9A of Schedule 8 (Distributable amount) to the 1988 Act requires Welsh \nMinisters to specify in the report the distributable amount from the non-domestic \nrating account. Under paragraph 11A (Distribution: local government finance reports) \nof the same Schedule Welsh Ministers are required to set out in the report the basis \n(the basis of distribution) on which the distributable amount will be distributed among \nreceiving authorities.  \n 22  \n  \n",
