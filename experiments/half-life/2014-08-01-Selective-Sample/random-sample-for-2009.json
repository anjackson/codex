According to figures from the Financial Services Authority, some 11,054 homes in Britain were repossessed in the second quarter of the year, up from just under 6,500 during the same period last year, and 9,172 in the first three months of 2008.The number of repossessions is expected to continue rising, with the FSA figures also revealing an increase in the number of homeowners who are in arrears on their mortgage. By the end of June this year, some 312,000 families were behind on their mortgage payments, up 16 per cent compared to the same period in 2007.\n\nMeanwhile, homeowners in some of central London’s wealthiest areas are also beginning to feel the pinch, according to data published by the Land Registry yesterday. In September, house prices in Kensington and Chelsea – which had been steadily rising at an annualised rate of 33.5 per cent a year ago – fell by 2 per cent, having fallen by 1.1 per cent the previous month. House prices in Islington fell by 1 per cent in September from August, and in Westminster, which includes Mayfair, the area favoured by hedge fund managers, it fell by a more modest 0.8 per cent. Many of the areas now showing declines are those that have been home to high-flying financiers whose careers may be in doubt as leading financial firms cut back on staff. Overall, prices of homes in England and Wales have fallen by 8 per cent year on year, losing 2.2 per cent in value in September alone.\n\nBut mortgage approvals for house purchases rose in September for the first time in more than a year, but remained near record lows, new figures from the Bank of England show. The Bank said mortgage approvals for new house purchases rose to 33,000 last month from a record low of 32,000 in August, the first rise since June 2007, but at the second lowest level recorded since the series began in 1993. The level is also more than 67 per cent lower than the 101,000 mortgages approved in September last year.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: mortgage, repossession, housing market\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nPrevious article: Lunchtime news Monday 27 October 2008\n\n\n\n\nNext article Spain introduces mortgage holiday\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComments:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nNo comments have been made on this article yet.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeave a comment\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tName:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmail:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEnter the word you see below:\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n  \t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n  \t\t\t\n  \t\t\t\n  \t\t\t\n  \t\t\t\t\n\tAll tags\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tadvice service, \n\t\t\n\t\taffordability, \n\t\t\n\t\taffordable homes, \n\t\t\n\t\taffordable housing, \n\t\t\n\t\talmos, \n\t\t\n\t\tanti-social behaviour, \n\t\t\n\t\tarrears, \n\t\t\n\t\tasylum seekers, \n\t\t\n\t\tauction, \n\t\t\n\t\tbank of england, \n\t\t\n\t\tbanks, \n\t\t\n\t\tbenefits, \n\t\t\n\t\tbills, \n\t\t\n\t\tblogroll, \n\t\t\n\t\tbritish bankers association, \n\t\t\n\t\tbuilding societies, \n\t\t\n\t\tbuy to let, \n\t\t\n\t\tcarbon dioxide emissions, \n\t\t\n\t\tcare, \n\t\t\n\t\tcare home fees, \n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tBlog archive\n\n\t\n\t\n2009\n\n\t\tJanuary 2009\n\n\n\t\n2008\n\n\t\tDecember 2008\n\tNovember 2008\n\tOctober 2008\n\tSeptember 2008\n\tAugust 2008\n\tJuly 2008\n\tJune 2008\n\tMay 2008\n\tApril 2008\n\tMarch 2008\n\tFebruary 2008\n\tJanuary 2008\n\n\n\t\n2007\n\n\t\tDecember 2007\n\tNovember 2007\n\tOctober 2007\n\tSeptember 2007\n\tAugust 2007\n\tJuly 2007\n\tJune 2007\n\tMay 2007\n\tApril 2007\n\tMarch 2007\n\tFebruary 2007\n\tJanuary 2007\n\n\n\t\n2006\n\n\t\tDecember 2006\n\tNovember 2006\n\tOctober 2006\n\tSeptember 2006\n\tAugust 2006\n\tJuly 2006\n\tJune 2006\n\tMay 2006\n\tApril 2006\n\tMarch 2006\n\tFebruary 2006\n\tJanuary 2006\n\n\n\t\n\n\n  \t\t\t\n  \t\t\t\n\n  \t\t\t\n  \t\t\t\n  \t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \t\t\t\n\n\n  \t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\tAbout this site\n\n\t\tContact us\n\tSubscriptions information\n\tAdvertiser information\n\tDisclaimer and copyright\n\tPrivacy policy\n\n\n\n\n© 2005-08 ROOF Magazine | ROOF 88 Old Street, London EC1V 9HU\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t",

We have hit all of our milestones and are now moving from the planning phase to making the Park 3D - Demolition, Dig and Design - which will lead us up to Beijing 2008.\n\n\"The ODA and trade unions have been working very positively together. Unions have a vital role to play in helping us deliver world class venues, infrastructure and transport for London 2012 safely and on time, ensuring we leave a lasting legacy for this part of east London.\"\n\nTUC General Secretary Brendan Barber said: \"The TUC is fully committed to the success of London 2012 and we believe that unions have a key role to play in delivering that success.\n\n\"The General Council were delighted to hear from David Higgins about the progress that has been made in the 20 months since the Games were awarded to London.\n\n\"We will be working closely with the ODA and the other Olympic bodies over the next five years to see that we meet our common objectives of ensuring that this world class event produces top quality jobs, with commitments to safety, training, equality and a lasting legacy both for the area and the people who participate in the Games.\" \n\nNotes to editors\n\nDavid Higgins spoke at TUC General Council at Congress House this morning along with ODA Head of Construction, Howard Shiplee, and ODA Head of Transport, Hugh Sumner.\n\nMedia Enquiries\n\nContact the Olympic Delivery Authority Press Office on 020 3 2012 700\n\nwww.london2012.com.\n\nContact the TUC Press Office on 020 7476 1248\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated content\n\tODA board\n\n\nNews\n\tLondoners proud to build the Olympic Park17 July 2009\n\n\tExternal structure complete on Olympic Stadium16 July 2009\n\n\tUpdate on Olympic Park workforce15 July 2009\n\n\nBlog\n\tDistinctively British?

          "RNID.org.uk: About RNID: In your area: Wales: What we do\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we do in Wales\nRNID Cymru was set up in 1997 and is the newest of the regional operations. It supports around 480,000 deaf and hard of hearing people in Wales, as well as their families and others who work with them or for their benefit.\n\n\n\n\nIn the early 1990s we established a range of community-focused operations across the UK, with the exception of Wales. In 1995-96 we were lobbied by deaf and hard of hearing people in Wales, and this led to RNID Cymru being established in 1997.\nWe received a grant from the then Welsh Office and began to develop a range of services. The work focused on responding to the specific needs of people in Wales, especially in those areas where we had an existing track record.\nBreaking down barriers\nThere are 480,000 deaf and hard of hearing people in Wales. Many are prevented from accessing information, interacting with providers and employers and participating in training and careers events. This in turn impacts on learning and employment opportunities, and limits their ability to make informed decisions about careers and training options. \n\nWe work in four key areas to break down these barriers:\n\tcampaigning for change\n\tchanging attitudes\n\tproviding services\n\tresearch.\n\n\nCampaigning for change\nWe campaign and lobby on behalf of deaf and hard of hearing people in the Welsh Assembly government, and raises awareness of deafness in the media, among health professionals and the general public.\n\nChanging attitudes\nWe challenge negative attitudes and ignorance about deafness and hearing loss. It runs training courses to help businesses become more responsive to the needs of deaf people and those with other disabilities, which raises staff awareness and improves practical communication skills. \nProviding direct services\nWe provide a number of services directly to deaf and hard of hearing people in Wales, including: \n\tcommunication services, such as sign language interpreters and lipspeakers\n\temployment, learning and skills services to help deaf and hard of hearing  people find work, and to train employers to understand their needs\n\tcare services offering vocational, educational and life skills training to help deaf people with special needs live independently\n\tinformation services including a helpline, talks and equipment demonstrations.\n\n\nResearch\nWe act as a catalyst for research, performing and supporting medical, social and technical research in areas of key importance to deaf people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t",

Consequently, there is no obvious provision in this country for information, advice, support or counselling for anyone involved in - or affected by - a donor procedure before 1991&#39;. In fact, UK DonorLink is funded to provide counselling, and Professor Blyth is very sorry for this error and any confusion it might have caused.    At Professor Blyth&#39;s request, the above paragraph has now been replaced by the following: &#39;However, the remit of UK DonorLink is restricted to donor procedures occurring before the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act came into force in August 1991, and the HFEA is not funded to provide either counselling or intermediary services for donor procedures taking place since implementation of the Act. Consequently, provision in this country for information, advice, support or counselling for anyone involved in - or affected by - a donor procedure is far from systematic&#39;.\n\n\n\nOLDER RELATED ARTICLES FROM THE BIONEWS ARCHIVE\n\n\n\nAssurances of past donor anonymity are meaningless\n\n14 November 2005 - by Professor Eric Blyth\n\nThe New Scientist recently recounted the story of an American teenager conceived through ostensibly anonymous donor insemination who had been able to identify his donor through DNA testing and an internet genetic database service (also see BioNews issue 333, at http://www.bionews.org.uk/new.lasso?storyid=2808).    In fact, we have known...[Read More]\n\n\n\n________________________________________\n\n\n\nEggs and ethics in stem cell research\n\n\n\n28 November 2005\n\n\n\nBy Dr Jess Buxton\n\ngenetics editor, BioNews\n\n\n\nAppeared in BioNews 336\n\n\n\nIn this week&#39;s BioNews, we report on the ethical controversy that has lead to embryo stem cell pioneer Woo Suk Hwang resigning from his public positions - including that as chair of the World Stem Cell Hub, launched with much fanfare last month. What exactly did Hwang do wrong, and what do the revelations mean for stem cell research worldwide?   In 2004, Hwang&#39;s team succeeded where many other scientists had failed - they obtained a cell-line from a cloned human embryo. The advance, which some had claimed might be biologically impossible, paved the way for research into new treatments for a range of diseases. But shortly after the findings were published in the US journal Science, questions over the eggs used in the research were raised, in a Nature news report. It seemed that Hwang may have used eggs donated by a junior member of his team - an allegation that Hwang swiftly denied, with one Korean newspaper suggesting that it might be a case of &#39;sour grapes&#39; on Nature&#39;s part.   That appeared to be the end of matter, and more groundbreaking studies soon followed, along with fruitful collaborations with other scientists worldwide - notably Gerald Schatten, of Pittsburgh University in the US. The World Stem Cell Hub was ready to launch the next phase of this work - a network of laboratories whose aim was to generate, store and distribute human embryonic stem (ES) cell lines to researchers throughout the world. But the future of this crucial project is now in doubt, after Schatten ended his collaboration with Hwang, following the discovery that eggs were indeed provided by junior researchers. In addition, some women were paid expenses of around £840 each to donate eggs for the project, a practice now banned by a Korean law that came into force at the beginning of this year - although it would still have been legal when the research was carried out.    Hwang says that he did not know at the time that eggs had been paid for, or that some had come from junior team members - an ethically dubious practice since the possibility for coercion exists. However, it seems that Hwang later found out where the eggs had come from, and lied when questioned about the issue subsequently. It is this betrayal of trust that appears to have triggered Schatten&#39;s decision to break off the collaboration, and has made several laboratories question their planned roles in the Stem Cell Hub. Despite the revelations, and Hwang&#39;s very public apology last week, scientists have been quick to point to the excellence of the work carried out at Seoul National University. But what will happen to this research now?   In South Korea, politicians and public alike have rallied to support Hwang. His status as a national hero is undiminished, and there are reports of hundreds of women offering to donate eggs to his research. Supporters say Hwang&#39;s work represents their &#39;only hope&#39; for treating spinal cord injuries and other diseases, and also want Korea to maintain their position as world leaders in the field. This looks likely, and not just because of a ready supply of eggs - the Health Ministry has said the team will continue to receive $3 million annual funding.    But for stem cell research to truly progress, a global effort is required. Such work requires internationally recognised ethical standards, and needs to be carried out within a tight regulatory framework - such as that in place in the UK - to ensure public confidence. And the issue of obtaining eggs for ES cell research is one that urgently requires further debate, outside of the lab. Hwang&#39;s work has shown that using eggs from younger women can vastly improve the success rates in ES cell research. The challenge now facing scientists is how this can be achieved in an ethically acceptable manner. Finally, stem cell research needs adequate support and funding, from every government that is hoping its citizens will eventually benefit from the work. To deny millions of people the chance of better health certainly would be unethical.\n\n\n\nOLDER RELATED ARTICLES FROM THE BIONEWS ARCHIVE\n\n\n\nSouth Korean stem cell pioneer resigns\n\n24 November 2005 - by BioNews\n\nWoo Suk Hwang - head of the South Korean team that obtained the world's first embryonic stem (ES) cells from cloned human embryos - has quit his public positions after admitting that some eggs used in the work were provided by junior researchers and paid donors.

The shock resignation follows a statement last week by US scientist Gerald Schatten, in which he ended his 20 month collaboration with Hwang over the allegations.\n\n   In a press conference given on 24 November, Hwang announced his resignation from all his official positions, including chair of the recently launched World Stem Cell Hub. &#39;I sincerely apologise for having stirred concern at home and abroad&#39;, he told reporters. He said that he had found out late last year that two female team members had donated eggs for his team&#39;s ground-breaking research, which was published in the journal Science early in 2004. But Hwang chose not to make this information public: &#39;After serious consideration, I finally chose to protect my researcher&#39;s privacy. I could have been wiser&#39;, he admitted. Hwang also said that the head of a hospital who supplied eggs for the project told him last month that some donors had been paid, despite the fact that the Science article had said no women were paid to donate eggs.\n\n   The journal Nature first raised concerns over the origin of the 247 eggs used in the research in May 2004. It claimed that PhD student Ja Min Koo originally said that the donors had included herself and another woman who worked in Hwang&#39;s laboratory. However, the journal also stated that she later called back, to say she had not donated eggs, &#39;blaming her poor English for a misunderstanding&#39;.\n\n   The issue resurfaced following a police investigation of Hwang&#39;s collaborator Sung-il Roh, a fertility specialist at MizMedi Hospital in Seoul. It emerged that Roh paid some women 1.5 million won (around £840) to donate eggs to the project, which he said was compensation for the inconvenience of being hospitalised and having hormone injections for the 15-day long procedure. Although paying women to donate eggs has been outlawed in South Korea since the beginning of this year, it was still legal at the time the donations were made.\n\n   Last Tuesday, the Seoul-based television channel MBC revealed that at least one of Hwang&#39;s researchers had donated eggs for the work. In an interview with MBC, Hwang said that junior scientists had asked him about donating eggs to the project, and that he was &#39;very moved&#39; by the offers. But he added that to avoid misunderstandings, he persuaded them &#39;on several occasions&#39; that it would be better to work with the eggs the team had, even if there weren&#39;t enough. It now appears that the women donated their eggs without his permission, using false names.\n\n   Hwang says he has resigned from all his public posts as a way of seeking &#39;repentance&#39;, but will continue with his work at Seoul National University. &#39;Being too focused on scientific development, I may not have seen all the ethical issues related to my research&#39;, he said. UK researchers have said the episode highlights the need for strong regulatory oversight of the field, as provided by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. Biologist Robin-Lovell Badge, of the National Institute for Medical Research said: &#39;the excellent research carried out by Hwang and his team must continue, but in a way that considers the ethics in an appropriate way&#39;.\n\n\n\nNEWER RELATED ARTICLES FROM THE BIONEWS ARCHIVE\n\n\n\nHwang dismissed from University post\n\n27 March 2006 - by BioNews\n\nSeoul National University (SNU) has announced it will dismiss the discredited South Korean scientist Woo Suk Hwang, for his involvement in fabricating data during his work on human embryonic stem (ES) cells.

The Commission, an independent statutory authority that reports to the state government on options for law reform in Australia&#39;s second largest state, is currently enquiring and reporting on the desirability and practicability of making changes to the Infertility Treatment Act 1995 and the Adoption Act 1984; and making recommendations for any amendments which should be made to any other relevant Victorian legislation.\n\n   In August 2005, the Commission published a position paper reviewing the law that regulates access to assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) and the legal parentage of children born through ART. The new recommendations on surrogacy are contained in the Commission&#39;s third position paper, which was published last week. This is the last in a series of three papers which give the public a chance to comment on interim recommendations before a final report is given to the government. The paper calls for submissions from the public and other interested parties by 9 January 2006.\n\n   Professor Marcia Neave, chair of the Commission, said that the current law was contradictory because it says that clinics can only treat women who are medically infertile. So, while a woman is not prevented from inseminating herself with the sperm of a man in order to carry a child for someone else, if a couple wanted a surrogate to carry an embryo - created using their own or donated gametes - the law says that the surrogate herself must be infertile. &#39;It makes no sense to require the surrogate to be infertile before she can receive treatment to carry a child for someone else, which is why we&#39;ve recommended that surrogate mothers be able to have clinic treatment as long as they are carrying the child for a person who is unlikely to become pregnant, risks passing on a genetic disease or cannot physically carry or give birth to a child&#39;, she said.\n\n   Another recommendation made by the Commission is that the intended parents should be legally recognised as the parents of the child born to a surrogate, but not automatically. Professor Neave said that it is &#39;not in the best interests of children for their parents&#39; legal status to be in question, so we&#39;ve recommended that they be allowed to adopt a child carried by a surrogate mother, provided certain conditions are met&#39;. This includes an agreement from the surrogate that the legal parentage should pass to the intended parents - this, says the Commission, would allow the law to &#39;protect women against pressure to give up a child conceived as part of a surrogacy arrangement&#39;.\n\n   However, Professor Neave noted that the recommendations made by the Commission would only be relevant if altruistic surrogacy was allowed to continue. The Infertility Treatment Act 1995 is silent on altruistic surrogacy but commercial surrogacy is banned. If the government continues to allow altruistic surrogacy then the Commission also recommends that all parties involved in a surrogacy arrangement receive counseling, &#39;to ensure they understand the consequences of their decision&#39; and including a focus on the importance of telling children about their genetic origins and circumstances of their birth.\n\n   Among its other interim recommendations, the Commission states that surrogacy should be available for single people and same-sex couples. It also suggests that if clinicians or counselors fear that a child, if born, would be at risk of abuse or neglect from any of the people involved in the surrogacy arrangement then the decision whether or not to treat should be passed to an ethics committee. If the ethics committee decides not to recommend treatment then the decision can be reviewed by the Infertility Treatment Authority (ITA). However, treatment will be denied to anyone if they have been convicted for serious sexual or violent offences or have had a child protection order made against them. It also suggests that the only payments that should be permitted in surrogacy arrangements are those for the surrogate&#39;s medical and associated expenses, and that payment for loss of earnings should not be allowed. Further, it says that the register of donors held by the ITA should be expanded to include information about surrogacy. Other focuses of the position paper include looking at whether a minimum age should be set for women acting as a surrogate and whether surrogates should be prohibited from using their own eggs when entering into an agreement.\n\n\n\nNEWER RELATED ARTICLES FROM THE BIONEWS ARCHIVE\n\n\n\nVictoria to consider assisted reproduction law reform\n\n11 June 2007 - by Danielle Hamm\n\nThe Victorian Law Reform Commission (VLRC) has published its final report on Assisted Reproductive Technology and Adoption.

Both the acting State Governor Richard Codey and Jon Corzine, the Governor-elect, have declared funding for ES cell research to be a top priority. But, said Wise Young, one of the founding directors of the New Brunswick-based Stem Cell Institute of New Jersey, &#39;if politicians don&#39;t do something in the next year, they should kiss the effort goodbye&#39;.\n\n   In January, Codey pledged to invest $380 million in ES cell research in the state, and in July, the New Jersey Senate approved, by 21-14 votes, a bill which would allocate $150 million to the construction of a dedicated ES cell research centre. The rest would come from a $230 million bond referendum for research grants, in a similar way to the way the state of California granted ES cell research funding last November. Voters in the state will be asked to cast the decision on this issue in the 6 November ballot this year. Codey, who steps down in less than two months, has said that passing these two initiatives will be one of his main efforts in the time he has left. However, Corzine, who made ES cell research one of the focuses of his electoral campaign, says that he would prefer to pass his own plan for a stem-cell bond referendum of $250 million or more, although he supports Codey&#39;s efforts.\n\n   Meanwhile, in the state of Illinois, grants for ES cell researchers will begin to be issued next month, after $10 million was allocated in the state budget for the research. In July, Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich used an executive order to circumvent the legislature and allocate the funds to ES cell research. Illinois became the fourth state to devote public money to the controversial research after California, New Jersey and Connecticut. In September, an executive committee of the Illinois House of Representatives approved by ten votes to three a proposal to use the state funds in ES cell research and establish the &#39;Illinois Regenerative Medicine Institute&#39;. The Institute, which is supervised by the Department of Public Health, is in control of the state funding and will issue the grants. Jennifer Williams, a state health spokesperson, said that an advisory panel of state experts will determine who receives the grants so there are no conflicts of interest.\n\n   In Missouri, a campaign against ES cell research is being led by Catholic bishops in response to a campaign launched last week in favour of ES cell research in the state. The Missouri Coalition for Lifesaving Cures launched a state-wide advertising campaign asking voters to sign petitions which will enable it to put a measure in favour of ES cell research on next year&#39;s ballot. The group needs 145,000 signatures and, if it gets them, the pro-research proposal will be seen on the November 2006 ballot. The petitions were a response to efforts in the state legislature designed to restrict the research in the state.\n\n   Now, the Catholic Church has said that &#39;the state&#39;s four Roman Catholic dioceses will use the first Sunday of Advent to launch a campaign aimed at keeping Catholics from signing the petition, and to teach them the Catholic view of the issue&#39;, which opposes ES cell research because it involves the destruction of human embryos. The Church has also asked every Catholic parish in the state to hold an educational event to discuss the topic. Writing in the press, Archbishop Raymond Burke said that &#39;to sign a petition favoring the initiative is to promote the culture of death which tragically besets our nation and constitutes a cooperation in the destruction of human lives at their very beginning&#39;.\n\n\n\nNEWER RELATED ARTICLES FROM THE BIONEWS ARCHIVE\n\n\n\nUS stem cell news\n\n02 May 2006 - by BioNews\n\nThe Senate Health Care Committee in the US state of Florida voted 7-1 last week in favour of a bill that would provide state funding for embryonic stem (ES) cell research.

The team, based at the University of Tokyo, says the method will help make gene therapy more effective, by allowing precise control over when and where the therapeutic genes are switched on. The findings are published in the journal Nature Materials.\n\n   Gene therapy is the use of genetic material, either DNA or its close chemical relative, RNA, to treat disease symptoms. Some of the challenges facing gene therapy researchers include getting enough of the therapeutic gene into the body tissues where it is needed and controlling the level of protein produced by the inserted gene. The Japanese team has designed a photosensitive complex that can deliver the DNA into the cell, and then release it in response to a pulse of laser light. The researcher tested their approach by delivering DNA to rats eyes, and then activating it with a low power laser.\n\n   The complex gets into the cell via a process called endocytosis, in which the cell&#39;s outer membrane envelopes the complex and draws it into the cell. The membrane surrounding the complex then &#39;buds off&#39;, leaving it enclosed in a bubble within the cell. When the laser light is used, the photosensitive part of the complex breaks free from the bubble, simultaneously releasing the DNA. According to the researchers, cell death in the treated areas of the eye was minimal, while the activity of the gene delivered to the eye increased by 100 fold.\n\n   There is currently much interest in developing gene therapy treatments for eye diseases, since eye cells tend not to divide. This means the effects of the therapy are not so likely to &#39;grow out&#39;, as is the case for tissues made up of actively dividing cells. Also, according to US gene therapy researcher Christopher Norbury of Pennsylvania State University, the immune responses in the eye are less severe than in other tissues.\n\n\n\nSOURCES & REFERENCES\n\n\n\nLaser activates gene therapy in rats' eyes\n\nNew Scientist | 21 November 2005\n\n\n\n________________________________________\n\n\n\nNew study of complications after fertility treatments\n\n\n\n28 November 2005\n\n\n\nBy BioNews\n\n\n\nAppeared in BioNews 336\n\n\n\nWomen who undergo repeated cycles of IVF treatment are at higher risk of complications than women who just take medicines to stimulate egg production, say Finnish researchers. However, the risks of complications are low after each individual IVF cycle, say the researchers, who are based at the National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health in Helsinki. The team, who published their findings in the journal Human Reproduction, say they carried out the study because the frequency and importance of complications following IVF treatment are &#39;poorly known&#39;.\n\n   The scientists studied records for 9175 women who received IVF treatment and 10,254 who had ovulation induction treatment during 1996-1998 in Finland. They found that the rate of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) was 1.4 per cent after the first IVF treatment cycle, rising to 2.3 per cent over the whole study period. However, the rates in women who just received ovulation induction treatment were &#39;very low&#39;.\n\n   The team also found that overall, 15 per cent of the IVF-treated women and eight per cent of the women who received ovulation induction treatment needed hospital treatment at least once. The reasons included ectopic pregnancy and miscarriages, as well as OHSS. Infections and bleeding were not common after IVF, and &#39;even rarer&#39; after ovulation induction, say the researchers. To be included in the study, hospital treatment had to have occurred within 120 dyas of receiving fertility treatment, or, in the case of ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage, 240 days.\n\n   According to a report in the Daily Telegraph, past studies indicate that eight per cent of natural pregnancies result in complications that require hospital treatment - around half the rate of the IVF-treated group in the study. Martin Foley, chief executive of the pro-life charity Life, told the newspaper that &#39;these side effects of IVF are life-threatening but are not talked about sufficiently.\n\n\n\nSOURCES & REFERENCES\n\n\n\nComplications of IVF and ovulation induction\n\nHuman Reproduction | 01 December 2005\n\n\n\n'Extra risk' for women on IVF treatment\n\nThe Daily Telegraph | 25 November 2005\n\n\n\n________________________________________\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n--------------------\n\n\n\nFor editorial enquiries, please contact:\n\nDr Kirsty Horsey, Reproduction editor, BioNews\n\nor Ailsa Taylor, Genetics editor, BioNews\n\n\n\nProgress Educational Trust\n\n140 Gray's Inn Road, London WC1X 8AX, UK\n\nTelephone +44 (0)20 7278 7870\n\n\n\nCopyright BioNews 2009\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tMarked for Life: Are Genetic Markers Helpful in Understanding Psychological Disorders?

Bankers bonuses and financial regulation will be on the agenda. So what lead would the City Diarists like to see our politicians take?\nThese diaries are written by people who work in finance and have had a front row seat as their industry goes through the biggest changes in decades.\nThey give us regular insiders' updates on the mood in the City of London and the dramatic changes in the world of finance.\n\n        \n        \n        \n\n\n\n\n    \n\tLAURA\n\n    \n\n\nLaura (not her real name) works for a commercial bank in London.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\nAllegedly our telecoms, energy and water supplies are overseen by state regulatory bodies to ensure that the consumer is not being ripped off and that necessary industry investment takes place. Would this be something that could be extended to financial services? The basic answer is that it is already. We have the financial ombudsmen for complaints, the FSA and international organisations regulating how we communicate information, the structure of our charges and the amount of money we hold in reserve to support our lending. \nSo what else could be done? The upcoming G20 will look to make grand gestures and snappy sound bites about bank profits and rewards for staff and shareholders. Most likely these will be predominantly recycled and repackaged existing initiatives with the bulk of the statements agreed before any of the national representatives pull up to the opening dinner. \nThe primary purpose of government is to protect the citizen and provide those services which would otherwise not be provided by the market or those which are considered universally 'good' such as healthcare, education, police and the military. \nEven at its worst the open market is the best 'incentivisor' for innovation and good customer service in financial services. It is not possible to nationalise money as money is an international and intangible entity. Projects such as the massively over budget, unfinished and underperforming NHS computer system should provide clear warning against government trying to do something which the private sector is already doing better. Even National Savings and Investments isn't truly state run as the products and services are predominantly rebranded Bank of Ireland facilities. \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n            \n\n            \n            \n                    \n\n\n\t\"In banking it's the front line and not the puppet masters which has suffered.\"\n\n\n\n\n            \n            \n\n            \n            \n        \n    \n\nIf we run ourselves so badly that our customers move to another bank then we won't make a profit and will ultimately stare a performance review or a P45 in the face. So many in our industry have experienced this over the last 18 months and predominantly it's the front line, not the puppet masters which has suffered. \nThe vast majority of the civil service is unaccountable to their end users - note the periodic shambles at the Passport Office and the underwhelming lack of response you get to your growing frustrations. If the state was our source of loans, direct debit set-ups and mortgage one can only imagine the nightmare when the unions decide to down tools for days over public sector pay settlements or attempts at change - yes Post Office this means you too. \nThe government needs to realise that they are doomed to fail in their quest to turn financial services into a sackcloth and ashes wearing charitable concern. What would be the point in lending money to a start-up business if you couldn't make a return while carrying all of the risk of default by your customer? As with most things government related - do the minimum you need to protect the public and beyond that leave it alone. \nSpecial mention this week goes to the Liberal Democrats for their poll tax throwback million pound property tax - Vince Cable has undone a lot of the goodwill from business he had accrued by coming up with a pernicious and spiteful tax on aspiration and that is a shame. \n\n\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n\n\n            Read Laura's previous diary entries\n            \n\n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\tMARK\n\n    \n\n\n\"Mark\" (not his real name) works for a stockbroker outside London.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\nI am not usually a Daily Telegraph reader but having stayed away on business last night, I found the paper outside of my door as I rose this morning. As it was a freebie, I thought it would be rude not to read it. Immediately, the business sections headline \"G20 bonus agreement in the works\". This was immediately next to an article relating to ITV's impending appointment of Tony Ball and a graphical illustration of the \"Top FTSE 100 Compensation Packages\". Perhaps this is why I don't read the Telegraph. Compensation? Does this mean Tony Ball will be employed on a no win, no fee basis? \nI found it very interesting that both articles were next to each. We are told \"frantic\" negotiations are taking place within the G20 to stop excessive salaries. It is a clear message to the banking industry that this will no longer be tolerated. \nSwitching back to the ITV article, we are told Tony Ball will earn a basic salary of £1m a year with his total package set to be an estimated £21m over five years. I looked, but there was no reference to the G20 trying to stop excessive payment to media executives. Hmmm, strange. Perhaps £21m over five years is not considered excessive? It is to me! \nBack to the first article and we are told the G20 will be attempting to introduce a way of clawing back bonuses when individuals have been responsible for losses and payment should be in shares to create a vested interest in long-term success. I check back to ITV but it would seem that should Tony Ball make losses at ITV, he should be OK. \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n            \n\n            \n            \n                    \n\n\n\t\"Quite simply, the best talent will earn the best salaries.\"\n\n\n\n\n            \n            \n\n            \n            \n        \n    \n\nNow, I completely understand why banking is such an important sector however, it has to be a complete witch-hunt to target one industry in a such way. It was not that long ago that a slovenly comic and a monkey were fronting a thing call ITV Digital, which ultimately went bust, costing numerous people their jobs and their homes. Setanta was allowed to rise and fall, with further losses, but again, no further regulation. Yet still chief execs can pick up some £21m. It would seem the message to anyone wanting a career with, in my opinion, excessive earnings should simply switch to the media sector. Pay check unchecked \nQuite simply, the best talent will earn the best salaries. We operate within a free market and market forces are there to determine things such as salaries. Yet, we are suddenly allowing governments to try and regulate these markets more tightly. However, do they necessarily have the experience to make these decisions? Do we trust them to make these decisions? It seems like asking the criminals to run the jails. UK politicians for example have recently been accused of acts tantamount to fraud. Moats cleaned on expenses? I bet even the bankers would not do that! \nChange needs to occur but I worry the G20 are not the group to do this... \n\n\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n\n\n            Read Mark's previous diary entries\n            \n\n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\tANTHONY\n\n    \n\n\n\"Anthony\" (not his real name) works for an investment bank in the City.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\nIn previous diaries, I have said that bonuses can only be controlled if there is an international consensus and it seems likely that just such an agreement will be forthcoming at the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh. Controlling bonuses by paying a higher proportion of bonus in stock with some claw back when short term profits turn into losses in future years makes sense. \nMost workers in the City will actually support a responsible approach to bonuses because they also suffered financially when the stock price of the bank that they worked for plummeted. A key part of remuneration was share options and many staff would convert these to stock. Many employees who had nothing whatsoever to do with sub prime lending lost huge amounts of their savings because they had bought shares in their bank. \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n            \n\n            \n            \n                    \n\n\n\t\"Agreement on bonuses and financial regulation at the G20 will be easy because politicians love to please the voters.\"\n\n\n\n\n            \n            \n\n            \n            \n        \n    \n\nSenior bankers are more worried about announcements on financial regulation which will also be made at the G20. The proposals will have an inevitable downward impact on profitability, some say by as much as 30%. The changes proposed are already being discussed in papers issued by the EU and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. One proposal is to restrict leverage which is the ratio of total assets to capital. This is a good thing because Lehman's allowed its leverage to grow rapidly to over 40 times capital when a more appropriate level would have been around 15. High leverage was one of the reasons why Lehman's went bust. \nAgreement on bonuses and financial regulation at the G20 will be easy because politicians love to please the voters. It also deflects from the real issue which is how we begin to pay for all this. \nIn this regard, the G20 will make an announcement steeped in rhetoric but not much substance such as the one made by the Prime Minister that now is not the time \"to switch off the life support\". \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\nWe are now reaching the most critical stage of the recovery which is why the PM has at last felt able to say the dreaded \"C\" word. \n\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n            Those who have followed my diary\n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n will know that I have always predicted that this would be a W recession. My reason was that public sector cuts would take billions out of the economy which would increase unemployment and cause a renewed fall in house prices and lead to a second dip into recession. \nMany commentators share my concern but despite this markets have defied gravity. Jaime Caruana of the Bank for International Settlements said in an interview with the Financial Times this week. \"It is not the right time for complacency.\" \nIndeed, as I write Sterling was falling rapidly and the FTSE was turning red. \nI hope I am not right. A double dip recession can be avoided if interest rates continue to remain low. Sterling will fall to redress the balance and enable foreign investors to reap a higher return buying enormous quantities of debt to fund our deficit. \nIt will make our exports cheaper and staycations more likely despite the absence of a barbecue summer this year. This will fuel growth and compensate for the cuts that are coming. \nA bit of rain never did anyone any harm. At least you don't get sunburn. My staycation in Britain this year was a great success. I felt a strong sense of satisfaction that I was doing my bit to save Britain from the recession and had avoided those awful airport queues. \n\n\n\n    \n        \n             \n            \n\n\n            Read Antony's previous diary entries\n            \n\n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n        \n        \nDo you agree with diarists?

Or don your tank for\n            world-class diving in the waters surrounding Little Cayman, highlights of any\n            Cayman Islands holiday.\n\nHolidays in the Cayman Islands: regions\nOn a Cayman Islands holiday, settle into glitzy high-rise beachfront condos on\n                    Grand Cayman or enjoy a quieter holiday on its two sister islands. Try\n                    Cayman Brac for an eco-tourism Cayman Islands holiday with hiking trails\n                and deserted beaches to explore. Or opt for undeveloped Little Cayman to join\n                international divers on holiday in the Cayman Islands.\n\nSightseeing on holidays in the Cayman Islands\nThe closest you'll get to city life on holiday in the Cayman Islands is\n                    George Town, the Grand Cayman capital. Spend part of your Cayman Islands\n                holiday taking in its traditional wooden buildings and swanky shopping malls. Then\n                visit Elmslie Memorial Church on your Cayman Islands holiday, with a roof\n                shaped like the hull of a schooner.\n\nOutdoor holidays in the Cayman Islands\nThe Cayman Islands' main holiday attraction is diving. Explore Bloody Bay\n                    Wall off the north shore of Little Cayman, a 6000-foot underwater cliff\n                bristling with coral. Take a boat trip from Grand Cayman on your Cayman Islands\n                holiday to snorkel at Stingray City, a stretch of sandy seafloor where\n                southern stingrays gather.\n\nFoodie holidays in the Cayman Islands\nIn George Town, savour Cayman Islands specialities like lobster and shrimp. On\n                Cayman Islands holidays in Cayman Brac, you'll find eat conch\n                shellfish on the menu. Stop at the Cayman Islands' roadside stalls to buy\n                Jamaican style jerk chicken and pork. Wash it down with locally brewed stingray beer\n                or have an after-dinner mudslide cocktail to toast your Cayman Islands holiday.\n\n\n\n        \t\n\t\t\t\t����Copyright 2009 Whatsonwhen Limited - All Rights Reserved\n\n\t\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n    \n\n    Fast Facts - Cayman Islands\n\tLanguage\n\tEnglish\n\tCurrency\n\tCayman dollar although the US dollar is readily\n                    accepted\n\tGMT\n\tGMT -5\n\tElectricity\n\t110 volts AC, 50Hz; standard two-pin plugs are used\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBook now\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nTop events\n\n\n\t\n\nPirates Week Festival Nov 2009 (annual)\n\n\t\n\nCayman Arts Festival Feb 2010 (biennial)\n\n\t\n\nBatabano Carnival Apr - May 2010 (annual)\n\n\t\n\nGeorge Town Butterfly Farm Daily\n\n\t\n\nQueen Elizabeth II Botanic Park Daily\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nOther destinations in the Caribbean\n\n\tHolidays in Antigua\n\tHolidays in the Bahamas\n\tHolidays in Barbados\n\tHolidays in Bermuda\n\tHolidays in Grenada\n\tHolidays in Jamaica\n\tHolidays in St Lucia\n\tHolidays in the Turks & Caicos Islands\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\tFavourites\n\tDelicious\n\tFacebook\n\tWindows Live\n\tDigg\n\tGoogle\n\tMySpace\n\tYahoo\n\n\n\n\nMore bookmarks\n\tStumbleUpon\n\tTechnorati\n\tBlinklist\n\tAsk\n\tFurl\n\tNewsvine\n\tReddit\n\tFark\n\tPropeller\n\n\nWhat are these?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCayman Islands\n\n\n\n\n\t\nHolidays in the Cayman Islands\n\n\t\nGrand Cayman\n\n\t\nFlights to Grand Cayman\n\n\t\nHotels\n\n\t\nFamily holidays\n\n\t\nBeach holidays\n\n\t\nRomantic breaks\n\n\t\nSpa hotels\n\n\t\nLuxury holidays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\nYou might also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\tBarbados\n\tTurks and Caicos\n\tFlorida Keys\n\tMuscat\n\tMauritius\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n��\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tfooter navigation links\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\toneWorld Alliance\n\t\t\t\tContact Us\n\tSite Index\n\tSite Help\n\tAbout BA\n\tLegal\n\tCookies\n\tAccessibility\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t��\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It can also help to accommodate, with a small degree of planning and forethought, those with special needs. Used without planning and forethought on the part of the administrators and the tutors who populate it, however, it can be an impenetrable barrier to many students.\n\n\nThe Disability Discrimination Act (1995), in particular Part 4 as amended by the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act (2001) - (SENDA), has affected all aspects of life in tertiary education (for further information see Willder, B. (2002) 'Disability legislation: implications for learning technologists in the UK' in Phipps, L., Sutherland, A. and Seale, J. 'Access All Areas').  This imperative has been heightened by the Disability Equality Duty. Not only do you need to ensure that your physical spaces and buildings are accessible to those with mobility and vision impairments, but also that your teaching and online material (including that within a VLE) is also as inclusive as possible. By inclusive, we mean something designed so as to be accessible to all users, regardless of impairment.\n\n\nThe couching of the DDA in general phrases such as 'less favourably', 'reasonable adjustments', 'substantial disadvantage' and 'anticipatory' created a sense of anxiety in some while others recognised an opportunity to take a more learner-centred approach and evolve good practice. There has been a distinct shift in recent times away from a rigid standards-based approach to electronic materials and towards a more holistic approach that discriminates between delivery mechanisms, content and context, focusing more on the learner's experience than meeting any checkboxes and guidelines.\n\n\nIf we make the distinction between the vehicle of delivery and the context of use it becomes possible to distinguish quite separate issues requiring quite separate guidance.\n\n\nVehicle of Delivery\n\n\nThe VLE is the mechanism by which all resources will be stored, shared or otherwise delivered - i.e. the actual VLE package (for example: BlackBoard or Moodle).\n\n\nIn January 2003, TechDis undertook a survey to consider the position and documentation of VLEs with regard to accessibility. The full report is available on the TechDis website and is reprised in Cann,C., Ball,S. and Sutherland, A. (2002)'Towards Accessible Virtual Learning Environments' in Phipps, L., Sutherland, A. and Seale, J. 'Access All Areas'\n\n\n\nThe survey covered seven off-the-shelf VLEs and asked the suppliers of each for details of the product's accessibility and the work being done by the developers to enhance this. It indicated that most VLEs still need further development before they are completely accessible for a majority of disabled students. WebCT and BlackBoard were at the time leading the field in terms of accessibility features within their products and assistance offered via their websites. The position is consistently improving, but even now the responsibility still lies with the person creating the learning materials and putting them into the VLE to make them as accessible as possible within the confines of what the VLE will allow.\n\n\nFollowing on from the research outlined above, TechDis undertook a user testing trial in conjunction with the Royal National College at Hereford, using WebCT and BlackBoard. Students who were hard of hearing, dyslexic or with motor or vision impairments tried carrying out simple learning tasks within the VLEs, such as uploading assignments, accessing a discussion facility, creating a home page and accessing a multiple choice quiz. If they used screen reading software (a package that converts what is displayed visually on-screen in words into 'spoken' words) such as JAWs or SuperNova, this was incorporated into the trial.\n\n\nThe results of the trial\n\n\nThe results of the trials showed that students using screen readers initially needed a great deal more support to overcome problems with navigation and actually accessing content. Most students spent three quarters of their task time actually undertaking the task in hand, and one quarter accessing the necessary information. In comparison, for students using screen readers the figures were almost reversed, with only a third of the time being spent on actually undertaking the given task. This emphasises therefore that the mere availability of assistive technology does not immediately mean that your students using that technology will be able to access a VLE without problems. However, students with other needs (such as using a screen magnifier for example) were able to operate within the VLE relatively successfully. The trial also showed that, however many difficulties the students had encountered, they still enjoyed the experience of interacting with the VLE. The message to tutors is to use the VLE to its fullest and try a range of methods to ensure access for all. \n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n                        \n                        \n\n      \n    \n                        \n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2008 Northumbria University, on behalf of JISC | This website is powered by Plone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can read this text, it means you are not experiencing the Plone design at its best.\nPlone makes heavy use of CSS, which means it is accessible to any internet browser, \nbut the design needs a \nstandards-compliant browser to look like we intended it. \nJust so you know ;)\n\n \n\n\n",

          "The History of Apple Day\nApple Day\n\n  \n \n      THE HISTORY OF APPLE DAY \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\nApple Day, 21 October, was launched in 1990 by Common Ground. [Unlike birthdays the first event is counted hence this is the 18th anniversary]. The aspiration was to create a calendar custom. We have a way to go yet, but some already think the event is traditional. We should like the day to become the autumn holiday – what better celebration of a new era positively linking \nculture with nature. \n\nFrom the start, it was intended to be both a celebration and a demonstration of the variety we are in danger of losing – not \n  simply in apples, but richness and diversity of landscape, place, ecology and culture too. Its success has shown what the apple means to us and how much we need local celebrations in which, year after year, everyone can be involved. In city, town and country, Apple Day events have fostered local pride, celebrated and deepened interest in local distinctiveness.\n\nApple Day is now an integral part of the calendar of many villages, local authorities and city markets. It is a focus for activities organised by the Women’s Institute, National Trust properties, Wildlife Trusts, museums and galleries, horticultural societies, shops and restaurants as well as for schools, colleges and environmental study centres. \n\n    \n\n    The first Apple Day celebrations, in the old Apple Market in London’s Covent Garden, brought fruit to the market after 16 years’ absence. Forty stalls were taken. Fruit growers and nurseries producing and selling a wide variety of apples and trees rubbed shoulders with juice-and cider-makers, as well as writers and illustrators with their apple books.\n\nRepresentatives of the WI came laden with chutneys, jellies and pies. Mallorees School from North London demonstrated its orchard classroom, while the Hertfordshire & Middlesex Wildlife Trust explained how it manages its orchard for wild life. Marks & Spencer helped to start a trend by offering tastings of some of the 12 ‘old varieties’ they had on sale that autumn. Organic growers were cheek by jowl with beekeepers, amidst demonstrations of traditional and modern juice presses, a calvados still and a cider bar run by the Campaign for Real Ale. Experts such as Joan Morgan identified apples and offered advice, while apple jugglers and magicians entertained the thousands of visitors – far more than we had expected – who came on the day.\n\nFor two weeks before Apple Day, in a marquee on the Piazza, Common Ground exhibited the photographs of West Country Orchards we had commissioned from James Ravilious alongside a display of more than 100 different apple varieties. People were amazed at the diversity of shapes, sizes and colours. We also offered lunchtime tastings of some of the varieties on show, and many people bemoaned the lack of such choice on supermarket shelves.\n\nWe will never know just how many people came to that first celebration – it was certainly thousands and even now we meet \n  people who effuse about it as a memorable event. Many wanted it to be repeated, but our intention was to spread the idea far and wide, encouraging people to celebrate Apple Day for themselves in their own city, village, parish, allotment or garden orchard.\n\nAnd so the tradition of Apple Day began. Over the next few years, the number of events being organised around the country grew from more than 60 in 1991 to 300 by 1997 and over 600 in 1999, some attracting thousands of people. Apple Day has played a part in raising awareness not only of the importance of orchards to our landscape and culture, but to the growing interest in locality and in the provenance and traceability of food. It has been one impetus behind the developing network of farmers’ \n  markets and is helping people everywhere to discover they are not alone in valuing the links between food and the land, between natural resource use and the impact we have on nature. \n\nWe have used the apple as a symbol of what is being lost in many aspects of our lives and shown that anyone can take positive action towards change. Over the years, Apple Day has been celebrated in a wonderful variety of ways by a diverse range of \n  people. Doctor’s surgeries, coronary support groups, the Cancer Research Campaign have taken Apple Day as a novel way of encouraging healthy eating. Each year, alongside tasting, juicing, baking, pruning and grafting, an imaginative array of games and creative activities have flourished – ranging from simple apple printing to mummers’ apple plays, new songs and poetry evenings. But invariably, year after year, the most popular event is the display, tasting and buying of numerous varieties of apples and the presence of an expert to aid identification.\n\n Look at images from Apple Days through the years, beginning with 1990 ... \n\n Or select a year between 1990 - 2008 \n\n BACK TO APPLE DAY  \n\n\n\n",

Brilliant he may be, and no doubt a commercial asset, but shirt sales alone are not going to cover his £9.5 million first year salary (rising to £28 million by his sixth). \nOne factor that may have weighed into the considerations though, hinted at in a Times article today, is of course tax. Spain's tax regime looks to encourage multinationals and their executives to relocate there, and so offers high earners a tax rate of 23% for the first 5 years that they are resident in the country. \n(To quote the Times:) \"What this means is that if Cristiano Ronaldo wants to earn, say, £8 million after tax, it would cost the club just over £10 million a year. If United were to offer him the same deal, it would cost them about £16 million a season.\"\nThe UK tax regime then serves as a significant brake on what British football clubs can offer players, while the Spanish one enables them to be bolder (or ridiculous, depending on your standpoint). Not that it would be a good thing if our clubs started offering £500,000 a week salaries (which is perhaps inevitable now) but the tax angle is an interesting aspect.  It may not have had played any part in Real's considerations of course, but its unlikely that it did'nt. When your paying another £7 million a year to Kaka, every little helps.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPosted by Ben Farrugia on June 12, 2009 at 04:24 PM in Current Affairs  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tTrackBack\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTrackBack URL for this entry:\nhttp://www.typepad.com/services/trackback/6a00d83550306a69e2011570087858970c\n\n\t\t\tListed below are links to weblogs that reference The tax incentive?:\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n        \n\t\n\t\tComments\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n                \n\n    \n        At least for once this article is concerned with the interests of those the TPA really exists to protect, mega high earners.\n\n\nI'm sure we are all really concerned about whether Cristiano earns £8million a year or £10million a year net. It will make all the difference to hard working families!\n\n\nOn the other hand maybe you should change the target of some of your vitriol. You point out that you can't choose about tax like you can with other producers you perceive to be overcharging you. However, you also can't change your football team and some of them are definitely overcharging us to pay these silly wages.\n\n    \n\n    \n        Posted by:\n        Steve Robson |\n        June 14, 2009 at 09:44 AM\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        No Steve I disagree the TPA represent average bloke Hardeep too.

They always attempt to fool the public and die hard supporters that it's a tactical switch for professional reasons but there's the lie.

          "REGULATORY APPRAISALREGULATORY APPRAISAL \n \nHOUSING, WALES  \n \nTHE HOUSING (RIGHT TO BUY) (PRIORITY OF CHARGES) (WALES) ORDER 2006 \n \n Purpose and intended effect of the measure \n1. All or part of the discount on a Right to Buy (RTB) property is repayable to the landlord \n(usually a local authority) if the property is re-sold within three years (five years for new \ntenants). However, a lender who has made a loan to the purchaser to buy the property \nhas a right to recover the value of the loan before the landlord claims back its discount, \nie the lender has the first charge.  This applies only to lenders who are “Approved \nLending Institutions” (ALIs).  The provision was introduced to encourage lenders to \nprovide mortgages for the RTB and related schemes (ie the Preserved RTB, Right to \nAcquire and voluntary sales by local authorities), which were perceived as being a \ngreater commercial risk.  It does not 'approve' the body for the purposes of its general \nlending or business practices.   \n \n2. Certain classes of bodies are specified as ALIs by section 156 of the Housing Act \n1985.  Other bodies may apply to the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for \nWales to be specified as ALIs by Order, ie specifically named in statutory instruments.  \nUntil 1999 the Secretary of State for the then Department of Environment, Transport \nand the Regions (now the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM)) specified ALIs \nfor England and Wales.  However, since devolution the power has been transferred to \nthe Assembly for application concerning ALI status in Wales.  A total of 178 ALIs have \nbeen specified since the provision was introduced.  This figure includes 18 bodies \nspecified by the Assembly since 1999.   \n \n3. The intended effect of this Instrument is to specify Church House Trust plc as an ALI to \nassist purchasers under the RTB and similar schemes in Wales.  The company is in \nthe process of being specified by Statutory Instrument as an ALI in England. This \nInstrument seeks to make a similar Order to cover lending by the companies in Wales. \n \nRisk Assessment \n4. Checks have been made with the companies’ regulator, the Office of Fair Trading and \nthe Registrar of Companies.  During the investigations the company has advised that it \nwill implement the self-regulatory Code of Mortgage Lending issued by the Council of \nMortgage Lenders and will comply with the OFT Guidelines on non-status lending.  The \nRegistrar of Companies has confirmed that the records of the company are up to date.  \n \n5. The vetting process is intended to ensure that applicants for ALI status are properly \nconstituted, adequately resourced and there is nothing to suggest that they are unlikely \nto conduct their business in a respectable manner.  However, neither ODPM, nor the \nNational Assembly, is a financial services regulator and the grant of approved lending \ninstitution status should not be seen as a general badge of approval.   \n \n6. If necessary, an Order can be made revoking ALI status.  In general, this is only \nconsidered justifiable if the regulator (eg the Office for Fair Trading) has revoked the \ndefaulter’s licence.   \n 1 \nOptions \n  \nOption 1: Do Nothing \n7. As the company has satisfied the checks, there would appear to be no justifiable \nreason for taking this option.  As other lenders, which have passed the checks, have \nbeen approved, it would be unfair to exclude this company without special reasons.  If \napproval is not given, the company may suffer some loss of business. \n \nOption 2: Make the Legislation  \n8. Approving the company’s application to be an ALI is the preferred option.  The \ncompany has satisfied the relevant checks and is being awarded ALI status in England.   \n \nBenefits  \n9. This proposed Order would increase the number of ALIs offering mortgages to tenants \npurchasing under the RTB and similar schemes, which increases their choice.  \nHowever, there is already significant choice in the market.  So the addition of one more \ncompany into the market would not be particularly significant.   \n \nCosts \n10. There are no financial implications for local authorities or other public sector bodies \narising from this Instrument. \n \nCompetition Assessment \n11. The addition of one company to the range of financial institutions providing mortgages \nfor RTB sales has, in theory, the beneficial effect of increasing competition.  However, \nthis is already a competitive sector and it is unlikely there will be any detrimental effect \non other businesses operating in the sector.  There are no implications for voluntary \norganisations or charities.   \n \nConsultation \n \nWith Stakeholders \n12. Checks have been made with the Office of Fair Trading and the Registrar of \nCompanies.  These have not revealed anything, which would suggest that the \ncompany should not be granted approved lending institution status in Wales.   No other \nconsultation has been deemed appropriate due to the negligible effect on other \norganisations of granting ALI status to the companies.  \n \nWith Subject Committee \n13. This Order was notified to the Social Justice and Regeneration Committee via the list of \nforthcoming legislation on 12 January 2006 (SJR(2) 01-06 Paper 4, page 7).  The \nCommittee did not identify the Order for detailed scrutiny.   \n \nReview \n14. An Order can be made revoking ALI status, if necessary.  In general, this is only \nconsidered justifiable if the regulator (eg the Office for Fair Trading) has revoked the \ndefaulter’s licence.  If complaints arise they are most likely to be made to the Office for \nFair Trading. \n \n 2Summary  \n15. It is intended that this Order specifies Church House Trust plc as an Approved Lending \nInstitution. This will increase, albeit slightly, the number of companies offering \nmortgages to purchasers under the RTB and related schemes in Wales.  This Order \nhas no cost implications for the Assembly, local authorities or others.   \n \n \n \n 3\n",

It felt like a wake up call. If I was going to see a church planted it was going to be a challenging & costly business!\n\n\nWhen I started the ChristChurch London, which now meets at the Piccadilly Theatre, it was the demands of enormous amounts of money required to move people into the city, hire venues & do all the other things required to get the church going.\n\n\nEach time, these felt like great mountains to climb!\n\n\nYou can be sure that you will face obstacles too, as you seek to get a church started. It is always a demanding process, even for those who have done it before.\n\n\nThat is why I always encourage potential church planters to ask themselves some serious questions first. Questions like, “Am I really suited to church planting?” “Will it play to my strengths?” or “Am I actually better wired up to do something else?”\n\n\nTo answer these questions assumes, of course, that we know what we are looking for. Just because you are an effective leader in an established church does not automatically mean that you will be so fruitful in a new venture.\n\n\nSo, what are some of the essential qualities specifically required, if you are going to be an effective church planter?\n\n\nThe first quality that you need is a sense of confidence that God has called you. This call can come in all sorts of ways: in your own times of prayer, through the encouragement of other leaders, through prophetic words that you receive or simply through a burning desire in your heart.\n\n\nHow it comes is not so important as the fact that you get it & that it then will not let go of you. It provides an unshakeable conviction in your heart that you have got to do this. This then enables you to keep going through the tough times & strengthen others to do the same.\n\n\nSecondly, you need to be able to gather people effectively. Church planting is all about meeting un-churched people & drawing them into a community of believers. To do this you must be at home with meeting people for the first time & building relationships with them. You should enjoy hosting parties & other events & be able to relate to people of different temperaments & backgrounds.\n\n\nThere is a basic rule in the early months of church planting: the more people you meet (& normally have through your house), the more the church plant will grow.\n\n\nI always encourage church planters to put on lots of fun events & get their church planting team to invite everyone they know. The primary goals of these times is simply to have fun & build relationships. Opportunities will come to share the gospel in due course but initially you are simply wanting to build some relationship so these people will want to see you again!\n\n\nIf the idea of engaging with those who do not go to church is not an exciting one then you should think carefully before you sign up for church planting.\n\n\nThirdly you need to be able to train leaders. It is surprising just how quickly a small group of people take up all of your time. Unless you focus on raising up others & then pass some of the work over to them you will not have any time to meet new people, develop vision or any of the other activities that are so important in the early phases of church planting. If you don’t do these things then the church plant will probably get stuck & stop growing.\n\n\nThe best way of training is to draw those with potential close to you. Share your heart with them, pray with them & have them in your home. Also, give them things to do where you can watch & give feedback. As they listen to what you say they will grow quickly as a result.\n\n\nWe need to start many new churches in the UK. Sending the right people out will speed up this process for they will not only be successful in what they do but they will provoke & inspire others to think about going & doing the same. That way, we can multiply the process of starting churches & reaching people right across this nation.\n\n\nDavid Stroud leads the Newfrontiers UK team & ChristChurch London, a new church in central London, www.christchurchlondon.org\n\n\nHe has planted three churches himself & been involved in the training & oversight of many more.\n\n\nHe has just launched a new website focused on UK church planting.

The common theme for the projects is the use of Second Life.\n\nA common complaint or should I say issue:-) with using Second Life in many institutions is actually getting access to it from institutional networks. After some frantic efforts by Martin Oliver (and the judicious use of cables) we were able to connect to Second Life so our presenters could give some in-world demo?s. However the irony of almost not being able to do so from the wireless network wasn?t lost on any of us.\n\nAndy Powell started the day with an overview of Eduserv and the rational behind this year?s research grant. He then gave his view on second life through the use of his extensive (and growing) wardrobe of Second Life t-shirts.   The ability to create things is a key motivator for most users of virtual worlds such as SL; and these worlds can be seen as the ultimate in user-generated content. However, there are many issues that need to be explored in relation to the educational use of spaces like SL, such as the commercial nature of SL, and what the effects of the ban of gambling might be?What will be the effect of the increasing use of voice? It?s relatively simple to change your ?persona? just now when communication is text based, but the increasing use of real voices will have a dramatic impact and could fundamentally impact some users within the space.  There is a huge amount of hype around SL, however Andy proposed that in education we are a bit more grounded and are starting to make some inroads into the hype - which is exactly what the Eduserv projects have been funded to do.\n\nLawrie Phipps followed with an overview of some JISC developments related to virtual worlds.  Although JISC are not funding any projects directly working in Second Life this may change in the near future as there is currently a call in the users and innovations strand of the elearning programme which closes in early October.   The Emerge project (a community to help support the users and innovations strand) does have an island in Second Life and there is a bit of activity around that.  Lawrie did stress that it is JISC policy to fund projects which have clear, shareable institutional and sectoral outputs and aren?t confined to one proprietary system. \n\nWe then moved to the projects themselves, starting with Hugh Denard (Kings College, London) on the Theatron Project.  In a fascinating in-world demo, Hugh took us to one of the 20 theatres the project is going to create in-world. Building on a previous web-based project, Second Life is allowing the team to extend the vision of the original project into a 3-D space.  In fact the project has been able to create versions of sets which until now had just been drawings never realised within the set designers lifetime.  Hugh did point out the potential pitfalls of developing such asset rich structures within Second Life - they take up lots of space. Interestingly the team have chosen to build their models outside SL and then import and ?tweak? in-world. This of course highlights the need to think about issues of interoperability and asset storage.\n\nKen Kahn (University of Oxford) followed giving us a outline of the Modelling for All project he is leading.  Building on work of the Constructing2Learn project (part of the current JISC Design for Learning programme) Ken and his team are proposing to extend the functionality of their toolset so that scripts of models of behaviours constructed by learners will be able to be exported and then realised in virtual worlds such as Second Life.   The project is in very early stages and Ken gave an overview of their first seven weeks, and then a demo of the their existing web based modeling tool.\n\nWe started again after lunch with our hosts, Diane Carr and Martin Oliver, (London Knowledge Lab) talking about their project; ?Learning in Second Life: convention, context and methods?.  As the title suggest this project is concerned with exploring the motivations and conventions of virtual worlds such as Second Life. Building on previous work undertaken by the team, the project is going to undertake some comparative studies between World of Warcraft and Second Life to see what are the key factors to providing successful online experiences in such ?worlds? and also to see what lessons need be taken into mainstream education when using such technologies. \n\nThe final project presentation came from Daniel Livingstone (University of Paisley). Daniel?s ?Learning support in Second Life with Sloodle? project is building links between the open source VLE Moodle and SL - hence ?Sloodle?.  Once again we were taken in-world on a tour of their Sloodle site as Daniel explained his experiences with using SL with students. Daniel has found that students do need a lot of support (or scaffolding) to be able to exploit environments such as SL within an educational context - even the digital natives don?t always ?get? SL. There are also issues in linking virtual environments with VLE systems - authentication being a key issue even for the open source Moodle.\n\nThe day ended with a discussion session chaired by Paul Hollins (CETIS).  The discussion broadened out from the project specific focus of the presentations and into more a more general discussion about where we are with second life in education. Does it (and other similar virtual worlds) really offer something new for education?  Are the barriers too high and can we prove the educational benefits? Should we make students use this type of technology? Unsurprisingly it seemed that most people in the room were convinced on the educational benefits of virtual worlds but as with all technology it should only be used as and when appropriate.  Issues of accessibility and FE involvement were also brought up during the session.\n\nPersonally I found the day very informative and re-assuring - practically all the speakers noted their initial disappointment and lack of engagement with Second Life: so I?m now going to go back in-world and try to escape from orientation island:-) It will be interesting to follow the developments of all the projects over the coming year. \n\nFurther information about the day and copies of the presentations are available from the [http://wiki.cetis.ac.uk/EduservCETIS_20Sep2007 EC wiki]. \n\n            \n\n        \n\n\t\n\n        \n            \n                ALT-C 2007 - moving from ?e? to ?p??                September 13\n            \n\n            Filed under cetis-community by Sheilamacneill | 0 comments\n\n            \n                   Another year, another ALT-C . . . as usual this year?s conference was a great opportunity to catch up with colleagues, see and hear some new things, and some not quite so new things. There has been a lot of coverage of this year?s conference and ALT-C themselves have produced a RSS feed aggregating blogs of people who have commented on the conference - nice to see an another useful example of mash up technology.\n\nOne of the overriding messages I took away from the conference was the move from talking about ?e? learning initiatives to more discussions about the issues surrounding the process of learning - presence, persistence and play to name a few.  \n\nIt was great to see so many projects from JISC?s Design for Learning programme presenting. I couldn?t get to see all the presentations but I did go to a couple of the more evaluation led projects (DeSila and eLidaCamel). Both projects are focusing on the practitioner experience of designing for learning and both highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the current tools and the need for more support mechanisms to allow ?ordinary? teachers to use them.  However both projects (and other findings from the programme) illustrate how engaging in dialogue around designing for learning can have an impact on practitioners as it really does make them reflect on their practice. \n\nThe first keynote, Dr Michelle Selinger (CISCO), reminded us all of the chasms that exist within education systems, between education and industry and of course the wider social, cultural and economic chasms which exist in the world today. Technology can provide mechanisms to start to bridge these gaps but it can?t do everything. We need to consider seriously how we take the relevant incremental steps towards achieving shared goals. Our education system(s) is key to providing opportunities for learners to gain the relevant global citizenship skills which industry is now looking for.  If we really want lifelong learners then we need to ensure that the relevant systems (such as eportfolios) are interoperating.  Michelle also highlighted the need to move from the 3 ?r?s to the 3 ?p?s which she described as  - persistence, power tools and play. The challenge to all involved in education is how to allow this shift to occur. The final chasm Michelle broached was assessment and the increasing chasm between what types of learners we ideally want (technology literate, lifelong learners, team workers) and the assessment systems that our political leaders impose onto us which really don?t promote any of these aspirations. \n\nThis led nicely onto the second key note from Professor Dylan Wiliam from the Institute of Education who gave a really engaging talk around issues of ?pedagogies of engagement and of contingency classroom aggregation technologies?.  Dylan gave an insightful overview of the challenges creating effective schools and creating quality control of learning  - a huge challenge when we consider how chaotic a classroom really is. He then went on to describe some innovative ways where technology enhanced formative assessment techniques could help teachers to engage learners and creative effective learning environments - well worth a listen if you have the time. \n\nThe final key note came from Peter Norvig, Director of Research, Google.  I have to say I was slightly disappointed that Peter didn?t give us some inside information on Google developments however he did give an entertaining talk around ?learning in an an open world?. Taking us through a well illustrated history of education systems he highlighted the need for projects based on engaging real world scenarios which are explored through group tasks. Copies of all the keynotes (including audio) are available from the conference website.\n\nThis year also marked the first ALT-C Learning Object Competition (sponsored by Intrallect). The prize winners were announced at the conference dinner and full details are available on the Intrallect website.\n\n            \n\n        \n\n\t\n\n        \n            \n\n        \n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n    \n        Design ? 2006 by the undersigned\n\n\t\n\n                This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5 License. \n\n    \n\n    \n    \t\t\n\t\t\tJISC CETIS\n\tcommunity wiki\n\tstaff blogs\n\tintranet\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t    \n\n\n",

It also houses Europe’s largest loan collection of tactile books and music. Membership is open to anyone who needs to use Braille, large print or electronic services. Member organisations include public libraries, schools, choral societies, social service departments and teacher centres.\n\n\n\nSize of award\n\n£100,000 \n\n\n\nHow did we help?\n\nTo help visually impaired people explore literature, NLB provides magazines and booklets that enable them to choose their reading material independently. One of those publications is Read On, a quarterly magazine with articles about reading, authors, writers in residence and literary prize winners. The Grants for the arts award has enabled NLB to add a new four-page section, Book Box, which includes news and reviews for young people.\n\n\n\nWhat difference did it make? \n\nThe Book Box initiative not only benefits young readers, it also frees up space in the rest of the magazine for adult readers.\n\n\n\nThe grant has also enabled NLB to introduce giant print (24 point) books in September 2004. Initially, 100 titles are available with more in the pipeline. \n\n\n\nHow has the grant helped the community?\n\nNLB says it is still early days to gauge feedback on the new initiatives but, observes reader development manager Linda Corrigan, we will soon hear if the readership is unhappy. The fact that there have been no complaints can be seen as a positive sign.\n\n\nThe National Lottery logo\nLinks\n\tNational Library for the Blind\n\tNational Lottery projects\n\tLottery good causes portal\n\n\n\n\t\n\n  \n\n  \n   \t Sitemap \n\t Terms & conditions \n\t Accessibility \n\t Recruitment \n\t Contact us \n\n\n  \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n",

          "Stagecoach Group: Stagecoach Group welcomes East Midlands rail franchise win  - print version\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStagecoach Group welcomes East Midlands rail franchise win \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22/06/2007\n\nStagecoach Group today (22 June 2007) welcomed the decision by the Department for Transport (“The DfT”) to award it the new East Midlands rail franchise.\n\n\nThe new 7-year and 4-month franchise, which is worth £235million in annual total revenues, will run from 11 November 2007. The last 16 months are dependent on meeting performance targets.\n\n\nStagecoach engaged with more than 80 local, regional and national stakeholder organisations in developing its proposals for East Midlands, which combines the current Midland Mainline franchise and regional services transferred from Central Trains.\n\n\nBrian Souter, Chief Executive of Stagecoach Group, said: “We are delighted to be entrusted by the Government with the contract to run a key rail franchise in a region that is the heart of the UK transport and logistics economy, with significant growth potential. \n\n\n“We plan to win back customers from the car and grow the market by delivering a high-quality service that meets the diverse needs of short and long distance commuters, business and leisure travellers. \n \n\n“Our innovative and value-for-money plans are designed to meet the challenges of growing demand, improving passenger perceptions of service and security, and making it easier for people to travel by train.\n\n\n“We look forward to delivering a comprehensive package of train, station and security investment, improved operational performance, increased capacity, state-of-the-art ticketing options and a range of other customer benefits.\n\n\n“This is an excellent result for passengers, taxpayers and our shareholders, and we will be working closely with local stakeholders to help meet their aspiration for the area to become one of the top 20 regions in Europe.”\n\n\nThe new franchise incorporates a multi-million-pound investment programme and will generate £133million (Net Present Value) in premium payments to the DfT over the period for the franchise. \n\n\nUnder the franchise, regulated fares will rise annually by RPI +1% in line with Government policy, while unregulated fares are expected to increase by an average of RPI + 3.4% per annum.\n\n\nThe East Midlands rail franchise will operate trains from the new St Pancras International station, providing direct connections with Eurostar services to Paris and Brussels following the opening of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link.\n\n\nThe key highlights of the new franchise, which will be operated under a single overarching brand and managed from headquarters in the East Midlands, include: \n\n\nImproved journeys and improved punctuality\n\n\tFaster journeys to Sheffield (2h08mins) and Leicester (1hr07mins) from London as part of a new timetable in December 2008 with potential further infrastructure-based improvements thereafter\n\tAdditional early morning train from Derby to cater for high levels of morning peak demand\n\tFurther features of the December 2008 timetable change include:\n \tA new daily direct service between London and Lincoln \n\tAn hourly Nottingham-Matlock service\n\tAn additional off-peak service each hour from London, allowing a new train service exclusively to serve stations south of Leicester\n\n\n\tPerformance plans that will help improve the public performance measure (PPM) to 90.4% from 83.6% by focusing on poorer performing regional services and trains\n\n\nFleet improvement and capacity\n\n\tSignificant increase in capacity, with more than 850 extra mainline peak seats into and out of London and an increase of nearly 10,000 off-peak seats per weekday\n\tIncreasing main line frequency to five trains per hour between the peaks\n\tBring forward first morning train arrival into London to provide an integrated connection to Eurostar for business passengers travelling to continent\n\tAdditional high speed train set from June 2012 to increase capacity in time for the Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games\n\tA 35% increase in capacity on Norwich-Liverpool weekday services \n\tA 9% increase in weekday capacity on other regional routes\n\tA £26.5m fleet interior and performance improvement programme, including décor, seats, on-train CCTV and technical modifications\n\tSignificant investment at Derby train maintenance depot (Etches Park), which will become the centre of train maintenance operations\n\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\tA centralised Information and Security Centre to respond to Help Point requests and monitor CCTV cameras\n\tAdditional CCTV cameras at 12 stations and mobile security staff coverage for stations and trains\n\tMore than 60 new or upgraded Help Points at 35 stations\n\tSenior Conductors, Train Managers and Revenue Protection staff equipped with PDAs to improve information provision and security for customers\n\t\tSecure Station Accreditation covering 87% of passenger journeys on the franchise\n\tMore visible staff presence on trains and at key stations to improve personal security\n\tAccreditation of three further secure station car parks\n\n\n\nFares and Ticketing\n\n\t\tInvestment in Smartcard technology to make ticket purchasing much easier\n\tPromotion of internet purchasing and telesales\n\tIntroduction of megabus.com fares \n\tFlexible ticket options, with different prices depending on the time of travel, including a trial to attract passengers to the shoulder peak using Smartcard\n\tInstallation of around 70 new self-service ticket vending machines to reduce ticket office queues and provide ticket retailing at locations such as Syston and Sutton Parkway for the first time\n\tIntroduction of automatic gates at four additional stations to improve security and reduce ticketless travel, resulting in nearly 90% of passenger journeys being gated at least at one end\n\n\n\nStation enhancements\n\n\tA £5m station investment, including a programme at the busiest stations covering:\n\t refurbishment of waiting rooms, shelters, booking halls and toilets, improved internal lighting, replacement seating, new cycle racks and repairs to forecourts. \n\tfitting out East

Without getting to technical ? best scientific evidence is that 550 parts of carbon dioxide per million parts of air would lead to a 2 centigrade rise in our temperature and that is the target that was set.\n\nNew evidence seems to point to the necessity of lowering that figure below 400 parts. I want to know why Sir David is seemingly setting his approval to the perhaps more politically possible higher target rather than one that would scientifically be necessary to save the world - literally. He disagrees and states that it should be 275 parts to save the world and tells the committee that he has been misrepresented in the media (don't we all know that feeling).\n\nSo here on record he makes it quite clear that we are in trouble. It really is a depressing Doomsday scenario. I suppose the only cheering point is that there does seem to be a growing  that there is a catastrophe awaiting and although hardly anyone has quite yet panicked ? post-New Orleans and the tsunami, there is greater attentiveness to the issues.\n\nAt 2.30pm I go to Westminster Hall again and this time I am on the front bench for a debate on the rehabilitation of prisoners - which is part of my own portfolio. It is a debate secured on the Home Affairs Select Committee report ? whose findings are pretty much pure Liberal Democrat policy. And all three parties croon together in admiration for schemes that avoid putting women into prison for minor offences with short sentences ? which means they can lose their home and their children and so causing damage far out of proportion to the original offence. We croon together about restorative justice and community sentences.\n\nWe all agree that this is not being soft on crime - but much tougher than simply locking people up. I am able to expound my favourite theory about what sort of individual you produce if you shut someone in a room, give them no attention, skills or education to equip them for coming out of the room. Will you have a well-developer individual capable of taking their place in society, not reverting to crime and not being dependent on the state? I rest my case, m'lord!\n\nOf course, the Minister just responded about how wonderful the Government are and how well they are doing!\n\n\n\nRelated posts:\n\tSigns of global warming?\n\tNuclear power\n\tHow do we tackle climate change?\n\tPay gap between men and women\n\tControl orders\n\n\n\t\t\n\tDate: Thu 17 November 2005\n\t\t\t\n\t\tTweet this ?\n\t\tShare on Facebook ?\n\t\tAdd to Delicious ?\n\t\tDigg it ?\n\t\tLibDig this\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\nAdd a comment\n\n\n\n\tClick here to cancel reply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName (required)\n\n\n\nMail (will not be published) (required)\n\n\n\nWebsite\n\n\nFacebook users: you can log into this site using your Facebook ID: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\tNotify me of followup comments via e-mail\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFollow me on Twitter\n\tBe my friend on Facebook\n\tKeep up with the latest on this site\n\tJoin the Liberal Democrats\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat they say about me...\n\n\t\tI know Lynne Featherstone.

Subject to Standing Order 15.7, the Committee must consider all statutory instruments or draft statutory instruments required by any enactment to be laid before the Assembly and report on whether the Assembly should pay special attention to the instrument or draft on any of the following grounds:\n\n(i) ��that there appears to be doubt as to whether it is intra vires; \n\n(ii) that it appears to make unusual or unexpected use of the powers conferred by the enactment under which it is made or to be made;\n\n(iii) ��that the enactment which gives the power to make it contains specific provisions excluding it from challenge in the courts;\n\n(iv) ��that it appears to have retrospective effect where the authorising enactment does not give express authority for this;\n\n(v) ��that for any particular reason its form or meaning needs further explanation; \n\n(vi) ��that its drafting appears to be defective or it fails to fulfil statutory requirements; \n\n(vii) that there appear to be inconsistencies between the meaning of its English and Welsh texts;\n\n(viii) that it uses gender specific language; \n\n(ix) ��that it is not made or to be made in both English and Welsh;\n\n(x) that there appears to have been unjustifiable delay in publishing it or laying it before the Assembly; or \n\n(xi) ����that there appears to have been unjustifiable delay in sending notification under section 4(1) of the Statutory Instruments Act 1946 (as modified). \n\n2. Subject to Standing Order 15.7, the Committee may consider and report on whether the Assembly should pay special attention to any statutory instrument or draft statutory instrument required by any enactment to be laid before the Assembly on any of the following grounds: ��\n\n(i) that it imposes a charge on the Welsh Consolidated Fund or contains provisions requiring payments to be made to that Fund or any part of the government or to any local or public authority in consideration of any licence or consent or of any services to be rendered, or prescribes the amount of any such charge or payment; \n\n(ii) that it is of political or legal importance or gives rise to issues of public policy likely to be of interest to the Assembly;\n\n(iii) that it is inappropriate in view of the changed circumstances since the enactment under which it is made or is to be made was itself passed or made; \n\n(iv) that it inappropriately implements European Union legislation; or\n\n(v) that it imperfectly achieves its policy objectives.\n\n3. The Committee must make any report under Standing Order 15.2 or 15.3 in respect of any statutory instrument or draft statutory instrument no later than 20 days after the instrument or draft has been laid.\n\n4. In calculating for the purposes of Standing Order 15.4 any period of days, no account is to be taken of any time during which the Assembly is dissolved or is in recess for more than 4 days.\n\n5. Subject to 15.7, the Committee may also consider and report on: \n\n(i) any other subordinate legislation laid before the Assembly;\n\n(ii) the appropriateness of provisions in proposed Assembly Measures and in Bills for Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament that grant powers to make subordinate legislation to the Welsh Ministers, the First Minister or the Counsel General;\n\n(iii) ��consequences for legislation subject to the consideration of the Assembly of draft orders under Part 1 of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006;\n\n(iv) the exercise of commencement powers by the Welsh Ministers; or\n\n(v) any legislative matter of a general nature within or relating to the competence of the Assembly or Welsh Ministers. \n\n6. The Committee may not consider: \n\n(i) ����any draft legislative competence order; or \n\n(ii) ��any statutory instrument or draft statutory instrument that is required to be laid before Parliament. \n\nMembership:\n\nThe current membership of the Committee is:\n\nDr Dai Lloyd AM (Chair)\n\nEleanor Burnham AM\n\nAndrew RT Davies AM\n\nAlun Davies AM\n\nPaul Davies AM\n\nIrene James AM \n\nSandy Mewies AM \n\nJanet Ryder AM \n\nKaren Sinclair AM\n\nLegal Advisers:\n\nGwyn Griffiths\n\nJoanest Jackson\n\nClerking Team:\n\nClerk to the Committee:\n\nAnna Daniel\n\nDeputy Clerk to the Committee:\n\nOlga Lewis\n\nAdministrative Support Officers:\n\nHasera Khan\n\nRuna Haque\n\nContacts:\n\nTo attend an Assembly committee meeting it is necessary to book a seat in advance; either by telephoning:\n\nAssembly Booking Line; telephone 029 2089 8477\n\nOr by e-mailing assembly.bookings@wales.gsi.gov.uk\n\nYou can contact the Committee by sending an e-mail to: \n\nLegislation.comm@wales.gsi.gov.uk\n\nOr you can speak to the Clerk, Anna Daniel; telephone 029 20898144\n\nCONTENTS\n\nThe Committee met on 15 January 2008.

Legislation Committee\n(SLC(3) 01-08)\n\n\nSLC87\n\nSubordinate Legislation Committee Report \nUnder Standing Order 15.2 the Assembly is invited to pay special attention to the following instrument.\n\n\nTitle: The Export and Movement Restrictions (Foot and Mouth Disease) (No 2) (Wales) Regulations 2007\n\n-implementing in Wales Commission Decision adopted on 5 December which further amends Commission Decisions 2007 2007/746/EC, 2007/709/EC, and 2007/554/EC. ��The principal effect of the Regulations is to enlarge the FMD export area and to ease some of the movement restrictions for FMD susceptible animals and animal products.\n\nThe Regulations were made and came into force on 5 December 2007 at the times specified in the Regulations. ��Regulations 5 to 9 (which relate to the export of meat, meat products and milk) and regulations 11 to 14 (relating to the export of hides and skins, animal products, exemptions and endorsement of documents) cease to have effect on 15 December 2007; the remainder of the Regulations cease to have effect on 31 December 2007.\n\nThe Export and Movement Restrictions (Foot-and-Mouth Disease) (Wales) Regulations 2007 are revoked.\n\nProcedure: ��Negative ������\n\nThe Assembly is invited to pay special attention to this instrument on the grounds set out in Standing order 15.2(ix) (that it is not made in both English and Welsh).\n\nThe Presiding Officer was advised that due to the length of the Regulations and the need to introduce them in Wales immediately, the Minister for Rural Affairs deemed it would not be reasonably practicable for them to be made bilingually in the timescale but that a Welsh translation would be available in due course.\n\nDr Dai Lloyd AM \n\nChair, Subordinate Legislation Committee\n\n15 January 2008 \n\n Annex 2\n\nSubordinate Legislation Committee\n(SLC(3) 01-08)\n\n\nSLC92\n\nSubordinate Legislation Committee Report \nUnder Standing Order 15.2 the Assembly is invited to pay special attention to the following instrument.\n\n\nTitle: The Export Restrictions (Foot-and-Mouth Disease) (Wales) Regulations 2007\n\n- lifting the export restrictions for FMD susceptible animals from Wales.\n\nProcedure: ��Negative ��������\n\nThe Assembly is invited to pay special attention to this instrument on the grounds set out in Standing Order 15.2(ix) (that it is not made in both English and Welsh).\n\nThe Presiding Officer was advised that due to the length of the Regulations and the need to introduce them in Wales immediately, the Minister for Rural Affairs deemed it would not be reasonably practicable for them to be made bilingually in the timescale but that a Welsh translation would be available in due course.\n\nDr Dai Lloyd AM \n\nChair, Subordinate Legislation Committee\n\n15 January 2008 \n\nAnnex 3\n\nSubordinate Legislation Committee\n(SLC(3) 01-08)\n\n\nSLC94\n\nSubordinate Legislation Committee Report \nUnder Standing Order 15.2 the Assembly is invited to pay special attention to the following instrument.\nTitle: The Education (Information About Individual Pupils) (Wales) Regulations 2007\n\nThese Regulations revoke the Education (Information About Individual Pupils) (Wales) Regulations 2003 and the Education (Individual Pupil Information) (Prescribed Persons) (Wales) Regulations 2004 and substantially re-enact them as amended. ��\n\nProcedure: ��Negative ������\n\nRegulations 5(4)-(7) make provision in relation to section 537A(5) of the Education Act 1996. ��Accordingly section 537A(5) of the 1996 Act should have been cited as a power relied upon to make these Regulations. ��It would have been safer to have cited section 537A in its entirety, rather than make an incomplete selection of sub-sections. ��However, as the power exists, even if it has not been recited, remedial action is not required. ��[Standing Order 15.2(v)]\n\nThe Government's legal advisers have noted that they agree with the points above.\n\nDr Dai Lloyd AM \n\nChair, Subordinate Legislation Committee\n\n15 January 2008 \n\nAnnex 4\n\nSubordinate Legislation Committee\n(SLC(3) 01-08)\n\n\nSLC95\n\nSubordinate Legislation Committee Report \nUnder Standing Order 15.2 the Assembly is invited to pay special attention to the following instrument.\n\nTitle: The Education (Pupil Information) (Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2007\n\nThese Regulations make minor amendments to the Education (Pupil Information) (Wales) Regulations 2004 (\"the 2004 Regulations���).\n\nProcedure: ��Negative ������\n\nThe following points have been identified for reporting under Standing Order 15.2.\n\nThe Welsh text of regulation 2(2) purports to amend the definition of \"cymwysterau allanol a gymeradwywyd��� in regulation 2(1) of the 2004 Regulations. ��In fact the term defined there is \"cymhwyster allanol a gymeradwywyd���. ��As the intention is clear, no correcting action is considered in respect of this an unfortunate slip. ��������[Standing Order 15.2(vi)].\n\nWhen an insertion is made into an existing provision, the different structures of the Welsh and English languages often result in the amendments not being direct translations. ��In the case of the amendment made by regulation 2(5) of these Regulations, the insertion made in the English text appears to be intended to have been a deletion followed by an insertion in the Welsh text. ��Unfortunately, the words \"mewnosoder��� (insert) and \"dileer��� (delete) follow each other so as to be contradictory. ��As this is part of the instruction rather than the substance of the amendment to the 2004 Regulations, and the intention is clear from the English text, no correcting action is considered necessary. ������[Standing Order 15.2(vi)].\n\nThe Government's legal advisers have noted that they agree with the points above.\n\nDr Dai Lloyd AM \n\nChair, Subordinate Legislation Committee\n\n15 January 2008 \n\n\n\n\t\n \n\n\tback to document

By working together members of the Alliance pursue the highest standard of health service and care for people living in Wales who are affected by a Neurological condition, their families and carers. ��Our membership includes: Alzheimer���s Society, Association of Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus, British Polio Fellowship, Cerebra, Charcot-Marie-Tooth Association, Chartered Society of Physiotherapists, ��Epilepsy Action, Epilepsy ��Wales, Genetic Interest Group, Headway, Huntington���s Disease Association, Myasthenia Gravis Association, Motor Neurone Disease Association, Muscular Dystrophy Campaign, Myotonic Dystrophy Support Group, Mutiple Sclerosis Society, Parkinson���s Disease Society, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Society, Stroke Association, Tourette���s Syndrome Association, Tuberous Sclerosis Association, Wales Association of ME & Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. ��\n\n1.3 As a patient group we welcome the opportunity to provide evidence for this inquiry and to contribute to the development of effective workforce planning. ��Workforce planning has a key role in ensuring that patients and their families get the right help, treatment and care when they need it. ��This should mean at the right time in the most local venue possible from a health and social care service that has the professionals with the capacity, capability and confidence to deliver a 'world class health service���.\n\n1.4 The Wales Neurological Alliance membership provides direct support to all those affected by neurological conditions, their families and carers. ��This is through voluntary work and also through direct service provision. ��Our membership is an important resource for those with neurological conditions and as such we are able to provide a clear voice on matters that will directly affect patient care and management. ��We have over the last few years proven to be a reliable and accurate conduit of the patient voice into health and social care policy development and we continue to be proud to do this on behalf of our members and their families.\n\n1.5 This paper addresses the terms of reference for this inquiry and makes recommendations from the perspective of the Alliance membership. ��The Alliance does not have dedicated staffing to carry out its work. ��Rather, the membership work together contributing to the Alliance in addition to their contracted work (the day job). ��The Alliance does not have dedicated resources to assist in its work and it operates on a 'shoe-string��� budget. \n\n1.6 In submitting evidence to the Inquiry the Alliance membership has been surveyed on the questions raised by the specific questions relating to the terms of reference. ��We have also included real life examples of how the effects of workforce planning are directly felt by patients, carers and families - those people who receive the care from the health and social services workforce. ��\n\nBackground\n\n2.1 Neurological conditions are illnesses, diseases or injury to the body���s nervous system (brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves across the body). Neurological conditions may be congenital (present from birth) or may present later in childhood or adulthood. They may be inherited or may be acquired (e.g. through injury); most are lifelong conditions. Many of these conditions mean that an affected individual will have a disability. These may be physical, mental or learning difficulties. ��\n\n2.2 People with neurological conditions therefore, often have specific needs to manage their treatment and care from health, social and voluntary services. Some neurological conditions are progressive and the needs of affected individuals change over time. ��It is of paramount importance that affected people, their families and carers receive sufficient and appropriate care from the health and social care services to enable them to live their lives with health, comfort and dignity. ��\n\n2.3 Prevalence figures for neurological conditions are not known for certain. ��A recent publication concluded that approximately 5.8% of the Welsh population - around 170,000 people are affected with neurological conditions1 2. Additionally, some conditions are more prevalent in the older members of society and as people live longer, it is likely that figures for neurological conditions will increase. ������\n\n2.4 Workforce planning must be placed in the wider strategic context of Designed for Life, Fullfilled Lives, Supportive Communities and the Chronic Conditions Management Framework. It must also be shaped by planning for specific conditions and it is here that particular problems are experienced in neurological conditions. Services for people with neurological conditions in Wales are patchy. ��There is no long term strategy for the development of Neuroscience Services in Wales. ��By comparison, in England, the long-term conditions National Service Framework including Neuroscience Services, was published in 2005 and it now forms the required basis for the planning and development of neurological services. ��The Wales Neurological Alliance continues to campaign on this matter. ����Without a Strategic framework for services it is considered to be very difficult to develop any meaningful Workforce Plan. ����We ask that the Committee to this inquiry draws attention to this matter to ensure that effective workforce planning in Neurology is not thwarted as this will have direct negative consequences for patient care. \n\n2.5 The process of Workforce Planning must also be centred on providing services for patients rather than through professional groupings. ��In particular, this is to ensure planning is carried out for conditions regardless of their prevalence rates. ��Some patients with rarer conditions do not have a specifically recognised service in existence for the necessary on-going management of their care. Often, clinicians are providing 'treatment by stealth���, out of area (across LHB boundaries) and some professionals provide this on a voluntary basis. ��\n\nWe understand that the issue of commissioning services is wider than the terms of reference for this inquiry, however it is a fundamental related issue and we wish to ask the committee of the vexing question: ��how can effective workforce planning be undertaken for an unrecognised service, despite the fact that there is clear and real clinical need for it by patients? It is critical that the needs of those with rarer conditions are factored into the development of an effective workforce planning process and do not fall through gaps. \n\nWorkforce Planning process\n\n3.1 The Wales Neurological Alliance is aware that there has been some degree of workforce planning taking place in both the NHS and Social Care Sectors in Wales since the late 1980���s. However a survey of members of the Alliance undertaken recently has indicated that there was little or no knowledge of the workforce planning process and no member organisation had been directly involved.\n\n3.2 It is understood that a new workforce planning system for the healthcare workforce has been set up. Again, none of the Alliance members recently surveyed were aware of the detail of the new system and there was no awareness of the Regional Workforce groups which have been set up to bring together local economies and facilitate workforce development across sectors.\n\n3.3 We hope that every effort will be made to ensure that a whole range of voluntary organisations and patient representatives are engaged in the process locally, regionally and at an all Wales level. ��Several reasons support this:\n\n3.4 As heath and social care service users, patients themselves know what is needed in relation to their management of care. ��They are able to high-light gaps in service delivery, to specify their needs, and additionally high-light what they do not need. ��\n\n3.5 Many voluntary organisations provide health and social care services and these are in addition to the statutory services. It would therefore be logical to include such organisations in Workforce planning as it would encourage 'joined���up��� multi-agency co-working to help patients. ��Additionally, such organisations have a great deal of experience and expertise and statutory services would benefit from this resource. \n\n3.6 The WNA in particular has considerable experience through its member groups of health services. ��The Alliance���s members are based throughout Wales and it also has strong partnerships with several local Neurological Alliances made up of patients and voluntary organisations. Not making use of these areas of expertise would be unfortunate and the absence of the patient voice on such developments would be disappointing. ��This expert resource would also require adequate compensation for time and effort as in a professional consultancy capacity. \n\n3.7 The Alliance believes Workforce Planning should be undertaken on local, regional and national levels. This would assist in details about local communities around Wales as well as for assisting the more specialised, comparatively rarer conditions. ��For such rarer conditions, workforce planning could facilitate pan-Wales networks which would help planning for service delivery and also for on-going professional support, including training. ��\n\nWorkforce Information\n\n4.1 The lack of involvement of Alliance members makes it difficult to comment on the quantity and quality of workforce information although patient experiences suggest this is currently far from optimal.\n\nPlanning for Long Term demands\n\n5.1 It is critical that workforce planning is shaped by robust service planning and commissioning and the health and social care needs of the population. ��Information submitted by Alliance members highlights the fact that to date very little account seems to be taken of future demands for services and the workforce implications of this.\n\n5.2 There is a real need to take account of people with Neurological Conditions in workforce planning in Wales. There has been no historical structure of support for people with neurological conditions. An effective pathway for neurological patients would allow for more effective workforce planning to begin. Unless neurology is given a stronger emphasis and development for commissioning, there will be a detrimental effect on workforce planning. \n\n5.3 Care pathways are recognised to be important tools in developing services, and should also be used to assist with workforce planning where available and suitable. ��These pathways offer a 'joined-up thinking��� approach across primary, secondary and tertiary services, and involve multiple agencies. ��\n\n5.4 Workforce planners must ensure that this process is not static but can work within today���s health and social care system - able to work with many different agencies across Wales. ��This includes working across primary, secondary and tertiary services to ensure a 'joined-up��� approach on delivering a workforce that centres on patient care. ��\n\n5.5 There must be good communication between outside of Wales service providers and those within Wales. ��It is essential that patient care does not suffer because of different policies such as Foundation Trust status, or waiting time differences in Wales compared to England or due to England working with its National Service Framework standards - this also includes the different frameworks for workforce planning. ��It is important that the planning of commissioning and workforce development are addressed together to ensure that when patients receive specialist intervention at centres outside of Wales, then local support services such as on-going care and rehabilitation following the procedure are ��available, accessible and appropriate. ��An example of this may be for an individual living in Caernarfon undergoing neurosurgery in Liverpool or further; to ensure the best recovery from this operation, there may need to be a sufficient physiotherapy service available in the locality to help the patient. \n\n5.6 Rehabilitation or secondary prevention services must also be addressed with adequate workforce planning. ��For many neurological conditions (and for chronic conditions), it is important to recognise that rehabilitation services do not mean simply 'getting better��� but rather they are maintaining health or preventing adverse deterioration through effective management of care as symptoms manifest. ��\n\n5.7 Coupled to this is the dearth of 'rehabilitation��� services available for people with long-term or progressive conditions. ��Such individuals may never be rehabilitated so that they may have been before disease onset, but they do require long-term management of their symptoms as they manifest. Workforce planning needs to be effective in ensuring that services have the capacity to manage all those people that need care and treatment as without it, their quality of life - for the rest of their days - can be detrimentally affected. ��People with Motor Neurone Disease are examples of those who will not recover - but will get a better life if their symptoms are managed early and without delay. ��\n\n5.8 As we have previously discussed, rarer conditions such as neuromuscular diseases - e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy often have smaller services that are not 'officially recognised���. This is often due to the fact that historically, these services began at a time when clinicians in the NHS (particularly those with a research interest) could develop services ad-hoc for their patients. ��This is no longer the case. ��Patients with such conditions are at considerable risk of losing the already 'shoe-string��� service they are receiving. ��A lack of Work Force Planning will always place significant extra strain on smaller services. In Summer 2008 the Neurologist with interest in muscle disease based at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff retires, and there is not likely to be a requirement for his replacement to have an interest in this area of neurology. ��Succession planning - particularly for specialist services - must be considered through workforce planning. ��\n\n5.9 Workforce planning must also take account of other situations such as long term sick leave and maternity leave. ��Another similar situation is 'job freezing��� - when posts become vacant it is always easier for a Trust which is under financial pressure to not recruit. ��When Specialist Nurses in Multiple Sclerosis or Parkinson���s disease retire, go on maternity or are ill there is no evidence of intervention to fill these posts. ��Patient care is directly adversely affected. ��Currently the Huntington���s Disease Management Clinic for Wales at the University Hospital in Cardiff is at a stand-still due to a 'job freeze���. ��People who have HD are not able to access their annual management clinic - essential in helping them manage their condition. ��Additionally, Cardiff is the HD European clinical trial HQ and this is a tremendous blow for Cardiff University���s HD research team. This is an example of how ineffective workforce planning has a negative impact on patient care and on research and clinical trials programmes. \n\n5.10 Workforce planning also needs to take account of transition services. ��Transition services are required when a patient reaches the age of 18 and can no longer access paediatric services. Rather they will need to continue their care pathway with adult services. ��In the past, patients with some conditions - particularly those which are inherited progressive conditions - may not have lived into adulthood. ��But as research findings are translated into therapy and care management, patients with certain progressive conditions such as spinal muscular atrophy (type II) and Pompe Disease may live longer. ��Workforce planning around developing transition services must be effective. ��People with conditions such as spina bifida and hydrocephalus are discharged from paediatric services on reaching the age of 18. ��They are not referred on to adult services (usually as there is no adult service in existence). ��At this time, affected individuals will only re-enter the health service following an acute emergency incident, often resulting in an overall deterioration in their health. ����As research and knowledge is translated to patient treatment and care resulting in people living longer, workforce planning must be able to catch up and provide the required work force in health and social care. \n\n5.11 Workforce planning must provide the necessary framework to allow for training and continued professional development. ��These are important to ensure professionals in health and social care continue to provide high quality care and can also learn about new developments such as novel treatments and therapies which will facilitate the adoption of best practice into the health and care services and also maximising the effectiveness of translational research benefits to help patients. ��\n\n5.12 Advantage should be taken of new technologies. ��Initiatives such as telemedicine and use of the Internet can assist in helping healthcare professionals learn new skills and expertise. ��They are useful in linking professional networks across the country, particularly those based in rural areas, or those dealing with comparatively rarer conditions which they themselves are unsure of how to co-ordinate and manage care. \n\n5.13 Voluntary sector organisations also fund many posts within health and social care services. These are often short-term contracts, sometimes for 'pilot project��� services - allowing professionals to trial and evaluate potential new services into the main stream system. ��These posts are often for key workers linking health professional teams to patients and are invaluable resource for patients. ��Work force planning must be developed so that statutory services may make the most out of new initiatives that have a positive effect on patient management so that they may be commissioned and continued by the statutory services. \n\nHealth and social care working together\n\n6.1 Health and social care services need to work together in a more holistic way and meet the patient���s and families needs more effectively ��For some conditions, professionals working with a patient may be duplicated as they are from different organisations. ��A frequent occurrence is for people with Motor Neurone Disease being assigned occupational therapists from a hospital (after diagnosis) social services (adaptations) and a third one for palliative services as the disease progresses. ��Individuals are confused as to which OT has responsibility for which issue. \n\n6.2 Allied health professionals are increasingly working to 'episodes of care��� with cases being closed without ongoing monitoring. This causes difficulties in progressive degenerative diseases where ongoing intervention (e.g. from occupational therapists) may be required as this can have a negative impact to quality of life the affected individual, family and carers. ��\n\n6.3 Voluntary organisations also provide professional services for patients and their families as 'family care officers��� - these are usually professionals bridging the social and health care areas and providing additional support. ��Organisations providing this service are able to view patients��� complete care and would have good information to facilitate WFP of the statutory services and should also be considered. \n\n6.4 A recent survey of patients with neurological conditions in North Wales highlighted the fact that 67% sought information, advice and support from the Voluntary Sector. Most people also stated that they gained most support from local voluntary support groups. This highlights the reliance of people on the Voluntary Sector and the potential which voluntary groups could contribute to the Workforce Planning process. Workforce planning must work closely with the voluntary sector so that the services from both statutory and voluntary organisations may work in parallel. \n\nOverall Staffing levels \n\n7.1 At present, there is a shortfall of healthcare professionals working within neuroscience services within Wales. ��We understand that this is largely due to commissioning of services. We urge Committee members to investigate these areas as this inquiry into improving workforce planning will be detrimentally affected. \n\n7.2 Medics. Number of Consultant Neurologists per head of population in Wales (Approx 1:214,000) c.f Uk (1:150,000) and ABN recommendation of at least 1;100,000. There are no Consultant Neurologists based in North Wales. ��Specialist services for neuroscience are provided from England. ��\n\n7.3 Allied health professionals. There is an overall shortage of trained therapist to support people with neurological conditions. In some trusts there are few or no therapists trained to work with people with neurological conditions, but there are patients with neurological conditions living within the Trust���s catchment area. This particularly relates to Physiotherapists, speech and language therapists and occupational therapists.\n\n7.4 Specialist Nurses are recognised as a significant benefit to the healthcare team���s role in managing patients with long-term conditions, particularly for neurological conditions. ��This is supported by guidance across the NHS (see NICE guideline 35 2006 for Parkinson���s disease which refers professionals to the importance of using Specialist Nurses in supporting this progressive condition. ��They are a crucial source of support and advice to patients, families and carers and enable many to manage their condition effectively and to remain independent in the community. ��Workforce planning needs to ensure patients have access to this important professional group. \n\n7.5 Specialist Nurses are employed haphazardly and often according to pressure from local patients and Voluntary Sector charities rather than through effective planning. ��Consequently many are overstretched and often unable to support the number of patients with a specific condition in their locality. ��Eg The Cardiff NHS Trust recently informed the Pontypridd and North Glamorgan Trusts that they would no longer accept Parkinson���s referrals from those areas as the Specialist Nurse based in Cardiff could not cope with hundreds of extra patents. ��However, no extra posts have been created to support patients in RCT and Merthyr or Cardiff. ��\n\n7.6 In an Epilepsy Action survey in January 2007, number of respondents commented that there was a need for more epilepsy specialists in the area and some indicated that they were unable to see a specialist locally. Only 29% of respondents reported seeing a specialist nurse. Epilepsy specialist nurses are widely recognised as key to delivering Epilepsy care. Epilepsy Action estimate that 53 Epilepsy specialist nurses are required in Wales, based on a caseload of 250 patients per Specialist nurse. At present there are only 12 in post across Wales.\n\nExamples of good practice ��\n\n8.1 There are many examples of good practice across Wales. ��However, they are regularly dependant on the personal interest of specific Doctors, Nurses or Therapists. ��This means when a Consultant moves or retires whole services risk ending in a very short space of time with little information for patients. ��Effective workforce planning that takes this into account will make it more likely that good practice can be further developed and mainstreamed.\n\n8.2 Specialist Nurses are increasingly important here as they are often able to create a more medium term approach to supporting patients with neurological conditions. ��This is partly because they are more adept at creating effective Multi Disciplinary teams around them which significantly benefits the patient. \n\n8.3 Rapid response team for Multiple Sclerosis Patients in Newport. Those with MS in the city of Newport are well served by the existence of a rapid Response team, a specialist community nursing team able to offer advanced treatments such as Intravenous Therapy in the home.\n\n8.4 Epilepsy Action runs a Sapphire Nurse Scheme which aims to support the appointment of epilepsy nurses in hospitals across the UK. Through this scheme funding is provided for an epilepsy specialist nurse up to maximum of one year full time or two years part time, after which the relevant NHS Trust/ Commissioners takes over all ongoing costs. Epilepsy Action seeks written commitment to ongoing funding before a final offer of funding. ��\n\n8.5 The Motor Neurone Disease Centre based at Rookwood Hospital with two part time specialist nurses providing support in south east Wales with the major funding provided by the Motor Neurone Disease Association together with a contribution from the Cardiff & Vale NHS Trust is currently providing an excellent service. ����\n\n8.6 Another example of good practice to be acknowledged is the Motor Neurone Disease support services in Carmarthenshire. ��This initiative is a collaboration between professionals. ��Again, driven by the interests of individual, this initiative is not funded / commissioned, but arises out of the health and social care professionals��� desire to provide a high standard of care across a wide geographical area. ��\n\nRecommendations\n\n9.1 There should be appropriate voluntary sector involvement in the workforce planning process at local, regional and national level.\n\n9.2 Workforce Planning should be closely aligned with a strategy for the development of neuroscience Services in Wales.\n\n9.3 There should be a mechanism for ensuring that service planning that cover rare conditions do not fall through gaps in the planning system.\n\n9.4 Workforce planning should be approached from a multi-agency and also a multi-disciplinary perspective. This includes working with primary, secondary and tertiary services - making it patient centred, working with care pathways might also be useful. \n\n9.5 'Rehabilitation��� or long-term management for conditions must also be adequately planned so that symptoms may be managed effectively and early to assist in good quality of life. \n\n9.6 Work force planning must ensure health and social care services must make the most of innovative practices - developing transition services, facilitating training for adopting new techniques and therapies from translational research and commissioning successful pilot projects that have been funded through 'soft money��� or voluntary organisations. ��\n\nReferences\n\n1. ����Jader L. 2007. ��An overview of neurological disorders in Wales.

With the goal of diminishing violence in our community through sport (instead of being on the streets doing wrong things) we want to bring happiness to children through leisure.' Luciana da Silva\n \n'It was very important for me to take part in this challenging experience. I learned a lot to work as a team. What was most important is that I got more mature and I intend to pass on this experience and what I learned to my community.' Jacqueline dos Santos Silva\n\nWith one of the participants:\n\n\n\nThe children and young people were thrilled to meet, Brazilian Olympic Volleyball star, Ana Moser, who won the hearts of Brazil in Atlanta when their volleyball team won silver medal with an exciting and brave performance.  \n\nThe Nottinghamshire teachers also spent two days in Brazilian schools where they were enlightened with information about the different culture and the challenges for the schools.   \n \n'The two days spent in Brazilian school were excellent. The staff and students were very excited to develop an educational partnership. The opportunities for cultural and educational understanding between Dayncourt and Frei Caneca will have a very positive impact on the students and staff. I look forward to developing this friendship and linking students together through sport and the wider curriculum.' \nKevin Jackson, Director of Learning Sciences, Dayncourt School Specialist Sports College\n\nThey saw the partnership as a great opportunity for the schools and pupils to engage with a school from a different culture. They found the visit invaluable, which created huge momentum to set the project off as well as establishing the beginnings of some lasting friendships.  \n \n'I have found myself reflecting on the importance of positive relationships between teachers and students and hope to bring some of that experience back to help UK teachers cope better with some of our disaffected students.' Alison Williams, Assistant Head, Dayncourt School Specialist Sports College \n\nMeanwhile, two students and two teachers from Palau – an island in Micronesia with a population of just under 21,000 - have this week visited Islay High School in Scotland, taking part in a cultural exchange that links two island communities from very different parts of the world. The party of four have engaged in PE classes, after-school sport activities and interacted with their Scottish hosts at a variety of local and cultural events.\n \nThe party were able to see London for a day before departing for Scotland and were keen to see the famous landmarks such as St Pauls Cathedral and Buckingham Palace. Shortly after they arrived they were treated to a dose of British weather when Islay was hit by stormy weather.  \n\nWithout a doubt an immense amount has been learnt from all sides.  Whilst Nottingham and Islay can offer assistance to how to support the development of leaders in sport and the PE curriculum both British parties agree they have a lot to learn from Brazil and Palau such as their strong sporting and community ethos and the dedication.    \n\nThe Palau-Islay and Recife – Nottingham links are part of a network of young global citizens with enhanced awareness of other cultures and is exactly this kind of activity which is a feature driving the International Inspiration programme. More to come on the Palau-Islay trip and the impressions and learning gained from the young people and teachers.\n\n\nPosted in Brazil International Inspiration Education Permalink\n\n    \n    You must log in to comment.\n\nAbout this blog\n\tAbout this blog\n\tUsing blogs\n\tCommenting guidelines\n\tTerms of use\n\tPrivacy policy\n\n\nPopular tags\n\tCloud\n\tList\n\n\tAquatics\n\tAquatics Centre\n\tAthletics\n\tBeijing 2008\n\tBusiness\n\tCeremonies\n\tCultural Olympiad\n\tCulture\n\tCycling\n\tEast London\n\tEast of England\n\tEducation\n\tGet Set London roadshow\n\tHandover\n\tLOCOG\n\tLondon\n\tODA\n\tOlympic Park\n\tOlympic Stadium\n\tOpen Weekend\n\tParalympics\n\tSeb Coe\n\tSponsorship\n\tSustainability\n\tSwimming\n\tTransport\n\tVelodrome\n\tWest Midlands\n\tWork for 2012\n\tyoung people\n\n\nRecent Posts\nToday\n\tFantastic support for the launch of Artists taking the lead\n\tNew images section on the website\n\nYesterday\n\tDispelling some myths about Equestrian at Greenwich Park\n\tBuzzing from the Pied Piper in Belfast\n\n\nRecent Comments\n\tSallyLester: It's fantastic that you're taking these important issues int...\n\tthegoodgerman: I share your opinion that the Games should have a human expr...\n\n\nMarch 2009\tS\tM\tT\tW\tT\tF\tS\n\t1\t2\t3\t4\t5\t6\t7\n\t8\t9\t10\t11\t12\t13\t14\n\t15\t16\t17\t18\t19\t20\t21\n\t22\t23\t24\t25\t26\t27\t28\n\t29\t30\t31\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nFebruary 2009\n\n\nSubscribe\n\tPosts (RSS)\n\nWhat is RSS?\n\n\nBack to the top\n\tContact us\n\tWeb accessibility statement\n\tJobs\n\tPrivacy policy\n\tTerms of use\n\tUsing this site\n\tFreedom of information\n\tCopyright\n\nThe official site of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games\n\n\n",

See your system administrator if you\nare having trouble logging in. Some functions are restricted to certain\nusers, and other users will get the message You do not have access rights to\nmodify this item. See your system administrator if this is not working\ncorrectly for you.\nIf the system is configured to use LDAP authentication, this means that you\nlogin with the same username and password as you use for getting email\ni.e. \"Mark Belanger\" \"MyPassword\".\n\nTop\n\n\n\n\nWhy can't I delete/alter a meeting?\n\n\n\nIn order to delete or alter a meeting, you must be logged in as the\nsame person that made the meeting.  Contact one of the meeting room\nadministrators or the person who initially made the meeting to\nhave it deleted or changed.\n\nTop\n\n\n\n\nHow do I make a recurring meeting?\n\n\n\nClicking on the desired time brings you into the booking screen.\nSelect the appropriate Repeat Type. The room will be scheduled\nat the same time, until the Repeat End Date, on the days\ndetermined by the Repeat Type.\n\nA Daily repeat schedules every day.\nA Weekly repeat schedules those days of the week that you\ncheck under Repeat Day. For example, use Weekly repeat\nto schedule the room every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday; check\nthose days under Repeat Day. If you check no days under Repeat Day,\nthe schedule will repeat on the same day of each week as the first\nscheduled day.\nA Monthly repeat schedules the same day of each month,\nfor example the 15th of the month.\nA Yearly repeat schedules the same month and day of the month,\nfor example every March 15th.\nFinally, a Monthly, corresponding day repeat schedules one day\neach month, the same weekday and ordinal position within the month.\nUse this repeat type to schedule the first Monday, second Tuesday,\nor fourth Friday of each month, for example.\nDo not use this repeat type after the 28th day of the month.\n\nTop\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I delete one instance recurring meeting?\n\n\n\nSelect the day/room/time that you want to delete and select Delete Entry.\n\nTop\n\n\n\n\nHow do I schedule rooms at different sites?\n\n\n\nYou don't.  Presently the system cannot book 2 different rooms simultaneously.\nYou must schedule each one separately.  Make sure that the time you want\nis available at both sites before making a booking.\n\nTop\n\n\n\n\nMy meeting failed to be created because of \"too many entries\"!\n\n\n\nAny meeting cannot create more than 365 entries.  There needs to be some limit on the\nnumber of meetings created.  This number can be increased if necessary.\n\nTop\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if multiple people schedule the same meeting?\n\n\n\n The short answer is: The first person to click on\nthe Submit button wins.\n\nBehind the scenes, the system is using a proper multi-user, multi-threaded\nrelational database than can handle many thousands of simultaneous users.\n\nTop\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between \"Internal\" and \"External\"\n\n\n\nBy default, MRBS defines two meeting types. \"Internal\" means that the\nmeeting will only be attended by employees.  An \"External\" meeting\nmight also be attended by customers, vendors, investors, etc. Your site\ncan define up to a total of 10 meeting types, according to your needs.\nMeetings are highlighted in the main calendar view with a color corresponding\nto their type, and a color key of all defined types is shown at the bottom\nof the main calendar view.\n\nTop\n\n\n\n\nHow much did the system cost?\n\n\n\nNothing.  See the next section for more information.\n\nTop\n\n\n\n\nHow does the system work and who wrote it?\n\n\n\nThe Meeting Room Booking System\nis open source software that is distributed under the Gnu Public License(GPL).\nThis means that software is free to use, distribute, and modify.  \n\nThe system is written mostly in PHP, \nwhich is an open source programming language that can be embedded in web \npages similar in concept to Microsoft active server pages.  PHP is especially \ngood at accessing databases.\n\n  \nThe database used for the system is either\nMySQL\nor PostgreSQL.\nMySQL is a very fast, multi-threaded, multi-user and robust \nSQL (Structured Query Language) database server that is also GPL.\nPostgreSQL is a full-featured multi-user open source Object Relational SQL\ndatabase server.\n\n \nThe system will run on multiple platforms, including the PC architecture\nusing the Linux operating system.\nLinux, is a free, open source, unix-like operating system.\n\n\nThe web server being used is yet another piece of free, open source\nsoftware.  The Apache web server is\nthe world's most popular web server.\n\n\nThe bottom line is:\n\nEvery piece of this system, from the operating system to the application,\nis completely free - source code and all.\n\n\n\nTop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView Day:\nJul 02\n | Jul 03\n | Jul 04\n | Jul 05\n | Jul 06\n | Jul 07\n | Jul 08\n | Jul 09\n | Jul 10\n | Jul 11\n | Jul 12\n | Jul 13\n | Jul 14\n | Jul 15\n\nView Week:\nJun 06\n | Jun 13\n | Jun 20\n | Jun 27\n | Jul 04\n | Jul 11\n | Jul 18\n | Jul 25\n | Aug 01\n\nView Month:\nMay 2010\n | Jun 2010\n | Jul 2010\n | Aug 2010\n | Sep 2010\n | Oct 2010\n | Nov 2010\n | Dec 2010\n | Jan 2011\n\n\nPrint Preview\n\n\n\n",

          "Final notice:  L A Mortgage Services Limited \n \nFinancial Services Authority \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFINAL NOTICE  \n \n \nTo: LA Mortgage Services Limited \n  \nOf: 88 Hastings Street \n Luton \n Bedfordshire \n LU1 5BH \nDate:  31 January 2008 \n \nTAKE NOTICE: The Financial Services Authority of 25 The North Colonnade, Canary \nWharf, London E14 5HS (the “FSA”) gives you final notice about a decision to cancel \nthe permission granted to LA Mortgage Services Limited (“LAMS”), pursuant to Part \nIV of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “Act”)  \n \n1. ACTION \n1.1. By a Decision Notice dated 26 April 2007, the FSA notified Mr Norman McIntosh \nthat it had decided to withdraw his approval, pursuant to section 63 of the Act, on the \nbasis that he is not fit and proper in terms of his honesty, integrity and reputation and \nalso his competence and capability to perform the functions to which his individual \napproval related. \n1.2. By a Decision Notice dated 26 April 2007 the FSA notified LAMS that the FSA had \ndecided to cancel its Part IV permission on the basis that it would be failing to satisfy \nthe threshold conditions set out in Schedule 6 to the Act (\"the Threshold Conditions\") \nas: \n(1) Mr McIntosh was the only approved person at LAMS and as such \nLAMS would not have adequate human resources in relation to the \n  \nregulated activities it sought to carry on (Threshold Condition 4) once \nhis approval was withdrawn; and \n(2) LAMS would not be able to satisfy the FSA that it was a fit and \nproper person having regard to all the circumstances, including its \nconnection with Mr McIntosh and the need to ensure its affairs are \nconducted soundly and prudently (Threshold Condition 5). \n1.3. LAMS referred that decision to the Financial Services and Markets Tribunal (the \n“Tribunal”).  The Tribunal, in a written decision on 7 January 2008, determined that \nLAMS’s Part IV permission should be cancelled. \n2. REASONS FOR THE ACTION \n2.1.  Following a hearing on 6 and 7 November 2007, the Tribunal (its written decision \ncan also be found on the Tribunal’s website) concluded that Mr McIntosh is not a fit \nand proper person, in terms of his honesty, integrity and competence, to perform the \nfunctions to which his approval related for reasons that included (1) his failure to be \nopen and honest with the Financial Intermediaries, Managers and Brokers Regulatory \nAssociation (FIMBRA) in 1995 and 1996 (2) his failure to provide full and frank \ndisclosure to the FSA about the suspension and termination of his FIMBRA \nmembership when applying to the FSA for approval (3) the fact that he signed, \npurportedly as a witness, a Land Registry form TR1 (which transfers legal title) for a \nproperty despite not being in the presence of the signatories when the document was \nsigned. \n2.2. Accordingly, Mr McIntosh's approval has been withdrawn and LAMS does not have \nadequate resources in relation to the regulated activities it seeks to carry on.  \nSpecifically, LAMS will not have adequate human resources (Threshold Condition 4). \n2.3. In addition, LAMS cannot satisfy the FSA that it is a fit and proper person having \nregard to all the circumstances, including its connection with Mr McIntosh and the \nneed to ensure that its affairs are conducted soundly and prudently (Threshold \nCondition 5). \n3. IMPORTANT \n3.1. This Final Notice is given to you in accordance with section 390 of the Act. \nPublicity \n3.2. Sections 391(4), 391(6) and 391(7) of the Act apply to the publication of information \nabout the matter to which this Notice relates.  Under those provisions, the FSA must \npublish such information about the matter to which this Final Notice relates as the \nFSA considers appropriate.  The information may be published in such manner as the \nFSA considers appropriate.   However, the FSA may not publish information if such \npublication would, in the opinion of the FSA be unfair to your or prejudicial to the \ninterests of consumers. \n 2 \n3.3. The FSA intends to publish this Final Notice and such information about the matter to \nwhich this Final Notice relates as it considers appropriate. \nFSA contacts \n3.4. For more information concerning this matter generally, you should contact Andrea \nBowe at the FSA (direct line: 020 7066 5886/fax: 020 7066 5887) at the FSA. \n \n \nJonathan Phelan \nHead of Department \nFSA Enforcement Division \n \n 3\n",

Despite their pain, they smiled as they spoke of their memories. \n \n         \"He was here only two weeks ago and he showed us a few of the pictures that he took of 'his boys',\" Brig Palmer said. \"We almost feel that we knew them. \n \n         \"He talked about what they had been through together and thought a great deal of them.\"\n \n         While on his recent leave, Lt Palmer had bought his first car, which was still parked on his parents' drive yesterday. \n \n         He had been just a month from finishing his six-month tour in Iraq, where he had worked hard to build bridges with the community.\n \n         \"He kept talking about the conditions that the Iraqis were living in and he was seeing things that he had never seen before and never wanted to see again,\" his father said. \"He knew how dangerous it was out there. He was doing something that he really believed in.\"\n \n         Brig Palmer said he did not want to politicise his son's death.\n \n         \"It is not a war where the enemy is somewhere over there and you know they are going to try to kill you,\" he said. \"A lot of Iraqi people are very friendly.\" \n \n         Brig Palmer said his son was a selfless soldier who had been proud to follow his father into the Army.\n \n         Lt Palmer, who has a 29-year-old brother David, trained at the Royal Military Academy in Sandhurst after attending Haileybury School in Hertfordshire and then graduating from Durham University. \n \n         He had been commissioned into the Royal Scots Dragoons less than two years ago, but was already considered a \"star of the future\" by his commanding officer, Lt Col Ben Edwards.\n \n         He had a girlfriend and a large number of good friends and represented the Combined Services at hockey and racquet sports.\n \n         Brig Palmer said: \"I can't imagine anybody not liking Richard. Of course as an officer you have to make difficult decisions, it is not about being liked. \n \n         \"But I can't ever imagine him being unfair. I can't imagine him doing something that would benefit him rather than anybody else.\n \n         \"I know that I am looking through rose-tinted glasses but we thought a lot of him. \n \n         \"We knew him for 27 years and 27 fabulous years and we have got all those memories.\"\n \n         Lt Palmer's family said they planned to hold a service of celebration and thanksgiving in his honour.\n \n         Col Edwards said he had seemed destined for a \"glittering military career\".\n \n         \"Lt Richard Palmer was one of my very best young officers. He was an intelligent, charming, talented yet incredibly modest individual,\" he said. \n \n         \"Despite having only served with the regiment for just under two years, he was widely regarded by soldier and officer alike as a star of the future. \n \n         \"He will be sorely missed by all those who knew him, and we will ensure that his life has not been sacrificed in vain. The regiment has lost a great ambassador, a splendid soldier and a fine friend.
