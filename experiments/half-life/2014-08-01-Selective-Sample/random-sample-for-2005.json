The Science Quality and Priorities \n        Team (SQP), which is distinct from existing science units within Defra \n        and reports to the Chief Scientific Adviser, is charged with carrying \n        out this work \n\n      Quality Assessment (Peer Review) \n\n      Peer review of completed Defra funded research is used to provide an \n        independent assessment of the quality of the science commissioned by the \n        Department. \n\n      To achieve this we need the advice of a large number of scientists with \n        expertise within Defra's research portfolio. For further information on \n        Defra research, please visit our Science \n        and Research Projects page \n\n      To recognise the valuable role that peer reviewers will play, Defra will \n        pay an honorarium of £130 per report reviewed. Click here \n        for further details of how the peer review of Defra funded research will \n        be carried out. \n\n      If you are interested in peer reviewing Defra-funded science, please \n        see these \n        details. \n\n      Thank you \n\n      Defra SQP extends a big thank you to everyone who has helped us by reviewing \n        and co-ordinating the reviews of reports and programmes. We greatly appreciate \n        the time and effort you have spent helping us assure the quality of the \n        Department's science. \n\n      Quality Assurance \n\n      Defra together with the Food Standards Agency (FSA), the Biotechnology \n        and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), the Natural Environment \n        Research Council, (NERC) and the UK devolved administrations has launched \n        a new code of practice to assure the quality of research processes used \n        in research that they fund. The code, which includes consistent standards \n        for research processes such as labelling and handling samples, aims to \n        reduce the risk of policies being based on incorrect findings and to help \n        improve public confidence in the results of publicly funded research. \n      \n\n      The \n        Code  \n        applies to all research funded by Defra, the FSA and the UK Devolved Administrations \n        and to research funded by the BBSRC and NERC at their own institutes. \n        It is intended that all contractors will be expected to comply with the \n        Code from June 2004. \n\n      The \n        Joint Code of Practice for Research applies to all research funded \n        by Defra, the FSA and the UK Devolved Administrations and to research \n        funded by the BBSRC and NERC at their own institutes. From 1 June 2004 \n        , all contractors applying for research funding must indicate their compliance \n        with the Code when submitting their research application form. \n\n      In December 2003, Defra commissioned the United Kingdom Accreditation \n        Service (UKAS) to carry out 'Baseline Assessments' of a selection of our \n        research contractors. The aim of this exercise was to gauge the levels \n        of preparation for the introduction of the Code, identify any areas of \n        the Code posing particular difficulty to contractors and to enable us \n        to offer feedback and support. UKAS identified a number of areas for improvement \n        across the assessed organisations and provided guidance on possible ways \n        of improving QA measures to meet the Code's requirements. This guidance \n        has been summarised and is available here. \n      \n\n      Contact Details \n\n      For further information, or enquiries about Defra's Quality Assurance \n        procedures for Science, please email sqp.enquiries@defra.gsi.gov.uk \n        \n\n      or write to\n\n      SQP \n\n        Area 1A,\n\n        Nobel House \n\n        17 Smith Square \n\n        London \n\n        SW1P 3JR \n\n      \t  \n      Useful links\n\n      \tHorizon scanning\n\tCompetitions & requirements\n\tSustainable Farming & Food Research Priorities Group\n\tFind out more about Defra Science\n\n\n      \n\n       \n      Additional pages\n\n      \tPeer review\n\tProgrammes reviewed & to be reviewed \n          \n\tAssuring the quality of research\n\n\n      \n\n             \n\t\n\t \tPage \n      last modified: 21 November 2005\n\n      Page published: 21 November 2005\t \n\t\n\n\n\t\n\tTop | Help  |  Feedback |  Access Keys  |  Copyright/Terms  |  Privacy\t  Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\n\n\n",

Regulations)\n\n\nThese Regulations further amend the National Health Service Pension Scheme Regulations 1995 (S.I.1995/300) (\"the Pension Scheme Regulations\") and the National Health Service

2004.\n\n\nRegulations 2 to 10 amend the Pension Scheme Regulations.\n\n\nRegulation 2 amends regulation A2 (definitions) by inserting various definitions relating to the types of medical services provided, and the persons or bodies who provide them. It also makes amendments to the definition of \"employing authority\" so as to include those providers.\n\n\nRegulation 3 inserts new regulation A3 which deals with the date from which a company which satisfies the conditions to be an OOH provider, is to be approved as an \"employing authority\". It also sets out the circumstances when such a provider may, and will, cease to be such an employing authority.\n\n\nRegulation 4 amends regulation B4 (opting-out of the scheme) to enable an employee of an OOH provider that has retrospectively been approved as an employing authority for the purposes of the scheme to opt-out, join or rejoin the scheme during that retrospective period.\n\n\nRegulation 5 amends regulation C1 (meaning of \"pensionable pay\" and \"final year's pensionable pay\" by substituting a new definition of of \"pensionable pay\".\n\n\nRegulation 6 amends regulation D1 (contributions by members) to provide that where an employing authority has failed to deduct contributions, the Secretary of State may recover the amount of those contributions by deduction from benefits payable to, or in respect of the member if that would be to the member's advantage and the member agrees to the deduction.\n\n\nRegulation 7 amends regulation D2 (contributions by employing authorities) by adding a new paragraph (9) which provides that certain employing authorities that have failed to pay or remit contributions to the scheme in the past may, in the future, be required to have in force a guarantee, bond or indemnity to secure future payments of such contributions.\n\n\nRegulation 8 amends regulation R1 of the Pension Scheme Regulations so as to provide that the pension scheme regulation apply to non-GP providers as if they were whole-time officers as from 1st April 2004.\n\n\nRegulation 9 amends regulation R11 (which deals with pilot schemes) of the Pension Scheme Regulations by omitting references to a registered medical practitioner engaged in such a scheme;\n\n\nRegulation 10 amends regulation U3 (accounts and actuarial reports) of the Pension Scheme Regulations so as to require certain employing authorities to provide the Secretary of State with a certificate of pensionable earnings within 12 months of the end of the financial year.\n\n\nRegulation 11 amends Schedule 2 to the Pension Scheme Regulations as follows - \n\n\n\n    \nparagraph (2) amends paragraph 1 of that Schedule by amending and omitting existing definitions and adding new ones. In particular, it adds definitions of \"board and advisory work\", \"commissioned services\" and \"collaborative services\";\n\n\n    \nparagraph (3) makes amendments to paragraph 2 by omitting references to \"the appropriate contracting party\";\n\n\n    \nparagraph (4) amends paragraph 3 to provide new definitions of what constitute \"pensionable earnings\" for principal practitioners and non-GP providers;\n\n\n    \nparagraph (5) substitutes paragraph 4 to deal with pensionable earnings of practitioners practising in a partnership with or without a non-GP provider;\n\n\n    \nparagraph (6) makes consequential amendments to paragraph 5 which deals with the calculation of \"pensionable earnings\" in a partnership;\n\n\n    \nparagraph (7) amends paragraph 6 to provide new definitions of what constitutes \"pensionable earnings\" in relation to practitioners other than principal practitioners;\n\n\n    \nparagraph (8) amends paragraph 10 so as to specify to whom a principal practitioner must pay his contributions in respect of various services he provides. It also makes similar provision in relation to locum practitioners and non-GP providers and contributions payable by employing authorities;\n\n\n    \nparagraph (9) amends paragraph 19 by omitting reference to a medical practitioner;\n\n\n    \nparagraph (10) adds a new paragraph 23 which modifies regulation U3 (accounts and actuarial reports) in respect of practitioners and non-GP providers.\n\n\n\nRegulation 12 amends the Injury Benefits Regulations as follows - \n\n\n\n\n    \nparagraph (2) makes amendments to regulation 2 (interpretation) in like manner to those made to regulation A2 of the Pension Scheme Regulations;\n\n\n    \nparagraph (3) amends regulation 3 (which deals with persons to whom the Injury Benefits Regulations apply) so as to include a non-GP provider and a person providing personal medical services who is not a practitioner;\n\n\n    \nparagraph (4) amends regulation 4A (which deals with the recovery of costs of providing increases to an allowance or lump sum under Part I of the Pensions (Increase) Act 1971) so that it also applies to a person providing personal medical services and a non-GP provider as if they were whole-time officers of the relevant Primary Care Trust.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n[1] \n1972 c.11.

          "Submission to the Working Group on Human RemainsHistoric Collections\nMarischal Museum\nMarischal College\n \nAberdeen AB10 1YS\n \nScotland\n \nUnited Kingdom\n \nTel: +44 (0) 1224 27 4301\nth\n30 November 2001 \nFax: +44 (0) 1224 27 4302\nemail: neil.curtis@abdn.ac.uk\n \nurl: http://www.abdn.ac.uk/marischal_museum\nProfessor Norman Palmer \nc/o Cultural Property Unit \nDepartment for Culture, Media and Sport \n2-4 Cockspur Street \nLondon SW1Y 5DH \n \n \nDear Professor Palmer, \n \nWorking Group on Human Remains \n \nThrough University Museums in Scotland (UMiS) I have received a copy of a letter from John \nWastle of the Scottish Executive Education Department about the Working Group and the invitation \nto comment. \n \nLike many museums, the collections of Marischal Museum contain human remains. These range \nfrom prehistoric skeletons from the North-East of Scotland to material that now forms part of our \nholdings of non-Western ethnography. I also note the holdings of the Anatomy, Pathology and \nForensic Science Collections elsewhere in the University. \n \nIn recent years, human remains in museums have become the focus of particular questions about \nrights of access, representation and repatriation. They are not alone in this; certain artefactual \nmaterial being accorded similar significance by many people. Indeed, the very concept of \ndistinguishing human remains from other material is something that has formed in culturally \nspecific contexts and should not be seen as an essential, purely natural category. Given these \nshifting contexts, it is therefore essential that museums acknowledge the plurality of meanings and \nsignificances accorded to material in their care and treat all advice and criticism with respect and \nsensitivity, recognising that no one group, institution or person has absolute rights over any \nmaterial.  \n \nMy understanding is that as there is no property in human remains, the normal laws of ownership do \nnot apply to such material in museum collections, though there are a number of legal provisions that \nconstrain the treatment of human remains. It might be that the application of normal laws of \nownership might enable museums to treat human remains alongside other material with appropriate \nrespect, including the ability to deaccession and repatriate as appropriate. \n \nI am very concerned that the Working Group was established with a remit that appears to extend to \nScotland, without prior consultation with the Scottish Executive or Parliament. As the treatment of \nhuman remains in Scotland is subject to Scots common law and the principal statutory provisions in \nEngland and Wales do not apply in Scotland, it is very concerning that the Working Party does not \nappear to include members with experience of either Scots law or indeed Scottish museums.  \n \n  \nSince the announcement of the establishment of the Working Party and its remit, I have been \ncontacted by the Australian High Commission about the presence of Aboriginal Australian remains \nin the museum. If the outside world is treating the Working Party as having a UK remit, it is \ntherefore essential that its membership is extended to include an understanding of Scottish interests \nthat will lead to a final report that can be applied in Scotland as well as the rest of the UK.  \n \nI hope that the deliberations of the Working Party will assist museums in developing a greater \nunderstanding of the competing claims that surround human remains and that procedures can be \ndeveloped to assist them in dealing with criticism about their treatment and demands for \nrepatriation.  \n \nI enclose a copy of the Marischal Museum policy toward sacred objects and human remains. Please \ncontact me if you would like to discuss any of these issues further. \n \nYours sincerely, \n \nNeil G W Curtis \nSenior Curator  \n \ncc  John Wastle, Scottish Executive \n Dr Graham Durant, Hunterian Museum, University of Glasgow \n Professor Ian Carradice, Convenor, University Museums in Scotland \n \n \n \n",

          "Replying to OffersReplying to Offers\n\nSource: www.ucas.com\n\nApplicants cannot reply to offers if they are still waiting for decisions from other universities or colleges. \n\nWhen we have received all decisions on an application, we will send the applicant a Statement of Decisions letter containing a reply slip, and a leaflet explaining what to do next. Applicants can use the applicant enquiry service to notify UCAS which offers they wish to accept. Applicants should reply as soon as possible. We recommend that applicants visit their preferred university or college before making a final decision, but they must reply to offers by the date given in the letter, or they will lapse. We will send a reminder before this date. \n\nIf an applicant wants to accept an offer firmly before all decisions have been made, they can use the CNC slip in Advice for Applicants to cancel outstanding choices. We will then send a Statement of Decisions letter so they can make a formal reply. \n\nAll replies are final, and applicants cannot change their minds later. An applicant should only accept an offer as a firm choice or insurance choice if they are happy to study there. If they get the right exam results the offer will be confirmed, and they will not be able to decline it to go into Clearing. \n\nInsurance offers If an applicant gets two or more offers they can accept one as a firm choice and another as an insurance choice, in case they do not get the grades they need for the firm choice. \n\nThere is no point in the applicant accepting an offer as an insurance choice if it asks for the same grades as, or higher than, the firm choice, unless the offers are based on different subjects. \n\nDepending on individual circumstances, you may wish to advise applicants for high-demand subjects to hold an offer in an alternative subject as their insurance choice. \n\nApplicants should not accept an offer as insurance unless they are happy to take up the place. If they get the right grades for their insurance choice but not for their firm choice, the insurance place will be confirmed and they will be committed to it. If the firm choice is confirmed, the insurance choice will be cancelled. \n\nJoint offers Applicants who receive joint offers (an offer for two courses in one offer letter) must accept or decline the whole joint offer. They cannot accept part of the offer and decline the other part at this stage. \n\nApplicants without offers Applicants who get no offers will receive a Clearing Entry Form at the start of Clearing (single-choice applicants will need to pay an extra £10 to take part in Clearing). In the meantime, they can contact any university or college that interests them. If an institution wants to consider the applicant, it will ask UCAS for a copy of the application form. Any offer of a place must be confirmed through UCAS in Clearing. \n\n",

During the \n        early years, formal suits for women underwent a structural change resulting \n        in looser lines and shorter skirts. By the mid-sixties, the flared \n        A-line was in style for dresses, skirts and coats.\n\n        Men's suits became sleeker and were often accessorised with bright, bold shirts \n\t\tand high-heeled boots.  The flamboyant look was in, \n\t\tsignalled by wider trousers and lapels, like those belonging to the blue checked Tommy \n        Nutter suit seen here.\n\n        Designers experimented with shiny new waterproof materials with a modern \n        look like PVC and perspex.  Paco Rabanne pioneered dresses made from plastic \n\t\tdiscs and metal links which looked more like sculpture than clothing.\n\n        As ethnic influences took over, the most fashionable people wore long \n\t\tlayers of loose clothing in vivid, clashing colours, typified by Thea Porter's \n\t\tkaftans and Pucci's dazzling prints.\n\n\n   \n\n   \n\n   \n\n  \n\n\n \n  \t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n  \t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n  \t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n  \t\t\t \n        \n\n        \t\n\n\n\n\n \n  \t\n        Click \n          on an image to find out more\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n \n   \n  •Homepage\n\n  •History of 1960s fashion\n\n  •Search by designer\n\n  •Search by year\n\n  •The V&A's collection\n\n  •Bibliography\n\n  •Links\n\n  •Reminiscence page \n  \n\n \n  \t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Sophie Hannah. I assumed Anne must know that Sophie is my daughter, but when I emailed her to ask, it wasn't so. Does this suggest a new - post-ish - meaning for the expression 'The apple doesn't fall far from the tree'? Anyway, I'm taking it as a prompt to feature two more of Sophie's poems.\n\n\nWells-Next-the-Sea\n\n\nI came this little seaside town\n\nAnd went a pub they call The Crown\n\nWhere straight away I happened see\n\nA man who seemed quite partial me.\n\nI proved susceptible his charms\n\nAnd fell right in his open arms.\n\nFrom time time, every now and then,\n\nI hope meet up with him again.\n\n\n\n\nHe is Now a Country Member\n\n\nHe is now a country member.\n\nThe subscription rate goes down.\n\nJanuary to December, \n\nIf you live or work in town\n\n\nYou pay more.

The new vision – intended as a high level statement setting out why Defra values the natural environment and the outcomes it is seeking to achieve – is an important first step in the development of a more strategic approach to natural environment policy making. \n\n      Following a series of stakeholder workshops earlier this year Defra has developed a draft vision on which it would welcome your views. \n\n      The draft vision is of a diverse, healthy and resilient natural environment, which provides the basis for our survival, well-being and prosperity now and in the future. The online forum enables everyone with an interest to comment on the draft vision and to read other people's comments. \n\n      Further information \n\n      See: \n\n      \tthe online forum \n\tthe natural resource protection pages  on this site \n\n\n       \n\n    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \tPage published: 16 November \n      2005\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t Top \n       |  Help \n       |  Feedback \n      |  Access \n      Keys  |  Copyright/Terms \n       |  Privacy\t  Department \n      for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\n\n\n",

This meeting \nhas access for people with a disability and will be open to the public.\nMany \nmeetings of the London Assembly and its Committees are webcast \nlive, and you can also view past meetings.\nAgenda\nDownloadable files \nfor agenda papers are grouped at the end of the page, linked from the appropriate \nagenda item.\n\n\n      1. Apologies \n\n        To receive any apologies for absence\n\n      2. Chair's Announcements\n\n        To receive any announcements from the Chair.\n\n      3. Declarations of Interest\n\n      In accordance with the GLA Code of Conduct, Members must declare any \n        personal interests they have in any item on the agenda or as they arise \n        during the course of the meeting. Members must orally indicate to which \n        item their interest relates. If they have a personal interest Members \n        must also consider whether or not that interest is a prejudicial personal \n        interest and take the necessary action. \n\n      Although you should consult paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Code, a personal \n        interest is, generally, one that affects you (individually or a person/ \n        body/organisation they have a close connection with) more than other people \n        in London. If a member of the public, knowing all the relevant facts, \n        would view your personal interest in the item being considered as so great \n        that it is likely to prejudice your judgement of the public interest, \n        then you have a prejudicial personal interest.\n\n      Consequences: If you have a personal interest: you must declare \n        the interest but can stay, speak and vote. If you have a prejudicial personal \n        interest: you must declare the interest, you cannot speak or vote on the \n        item and must leave the room. \n\n      Recommendations: \n\n        (i) That Members note the memberships of Functional Bodies and London \n        Borough Councils as set out in the table at item 4, and that they be recorded \n        in the minutes as personal interests.\n\n        (ii) That all Members declare any other personal or prejudicial personal \n        interests in specific items on the agenda over and above those listed \n        at item 4.\n\n      4. Minutes\n\n      To confirm the Minutes of the meeting held on 29 January 2003 as a correct \n        record of the proceedings \n\n      5.

Fitting childcare around a hectic career can be a constant struggle for many parents. Each episodeÂ gives each parent in turnÂ the opportunity toÂ take time off workÂ for a two week period and reflect on their work/life balance.\n\nNormal childcare arrangements are suspended as each partner gets to look after the children.Â  Unlike other parenting programmes, the series does not focus on child behaviour problems or intervene by telling parents where they are going wrong.Â  Instead it allows busy couples a chance to stand back from their work responsibilities and focus solely on family life.\n\nThe tone of the programme is warm and uplifting and features families and situations that the viewers sympathies and identify with, or can gain an insight into. Â Past contributors have said that taking part in the series has been hugely beneficial to their lives.\n\nFor more details please cantact:\nCarly Gilbert\nT: +44 (0) 1273 224 826\nF: +44 (0) 1273 711 675\ncarly.gilbert@ricochet.co.uk\nwww.ricochet.co.uk\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tMCBDirect \n\n\n",

This further merger must respect the public service commitments of ITV to the coverage of local communities and local politics.\"\n\n\"The role of the media - print as well as television and local radio - is absolutely crucial to the maintenance of a lively political debate at local level. It would be a disaster for democratic politics in Britain if, just at the moment when parties are increasingly recognising the importance of the local dimension in the delivery of high quality public services, ITV pulled the plug on serious local coverage.\"\n\n\"I am already concerned about the run-down of staff and programming for television. I will monitor the results of this merger closely to ensure that the £55 million of cost savings that Carlton and Granada have pencilled in do not include further cutbacks in regional capacity\" said Mr Huhne.\n\nMr Huhne also said that he would seek meetings with representatives of BECTU, the broadcasting trade union. \"Local journalism, including television journalism, is vital\" said Mr Huhne.\n\nNote to editors: Mr Huhne was formerly a journalist on both regional and national newspapers, and has also reported and presented television programmes. Mr Huhne is also a past chairman of the Liberal Democrats' broadcasting and press policy panel.\n\nMeridian is a subsidiary of Granada TV, and will therefore be affected by the Carlton-Granada merger. Meridian serves a population of 5.5 million in an area extending beyond the Thames estuary to Essex in the north and taking in all major centres as far west as Weymouth in Dorset.\n\n\n\nPrint this story.\n\n\nPrevious story: Junk Mail: Planet Arc Initiative Must Get Full Support (Mon 6th Oct 2003).\n\n\nNext story: Axe the Tax (Tue 7th Oct 2003).\n\n\nOther news stories from October 2003 (12).\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinted and hosted by Prater Raines Partners, 16 Riviera Court, Sandgate High Street, Folkestone CT20 3RP.\n\n\nPublished & promoted by Andrew Reeves on behalf of Peter Bucklitsch (Liberal Democrats) all at 3 Beech Court, Norfolk Close, Dartford DA1 5PD\n\n\nThe views expressed are those of the party, not of the service provider.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In compliance with the Local Government Act 1999, the Authority has agreed a \nprogramme of Best Value reviews for all of its functions. The review of Strategy, \nPlanning and Performance is scheduled for completion in the financial year 2005-2006. \nst\n2. This 1 stage report is part of the agreed process whereby the key issues for the review \nare identified at an early stage and, subject to agreement; further work is concentrated \non these areas for the remainder of the review. This approach was agreed at the Best \nth\nValue Panel on 20 May 2002 (BV51). \nWHERE ARE WE NOW  \nBackground to the review \n3. The duty of a best value requires Fire and Rescue Services to secure continuous \nimprovement with regard to economy, efficiency and effectiveness. The primary aim of \na best value review is to deliver credible recommendations and action plans that will \nresult in sustainable, significant improvements in service quality and/or efficiency for \nthe area under review. \n4. The Authority agreed to carry out three best value reviews during the second half of \n2004/05.  These are: Strategy, Planning and Performance (SPP); Communications and \nProperty Services. There is some inter-relationship between the reviews of SPP and \nCommunications, therefore a joint project board has been established to co-ordinate \nthe work and oversee individual steering groups for each review. This is to ensure co-\nordination, provide an efficient means of involving the executive and ensure that the \nappropriate people are involved at the right level. (Details of the Project Board are \nattached in appendix A Scoping document). The review of Property Services has \nseparate project management arrangements. \n5. Any best value review has to take place in the context of the current situation within \nthe Authority in terms of what has gone before and/or what is also happening while it \nis being undertaken. The review of Strategy, Planning and Performance will take into \naccount issues arising from the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004, the National \nFramework for the Fire and Rescue Service and the development of integrated risk \nmanagement planning, the Audit Commission’s report of November 2004 undertaken \nas part of the Initial Performance Assessment (IPA) exercise and the approach to future \nservice delivery set out in the London Safety Plan 2. All of these matters will be \nnd\nreflected in the work and recommendations contained within the 2 Stage review \nwhich is due to report to the Best Value Panel in May 2005.  \nDescription of service under review \n6. The functions and services relating to strategy, planning and performance are led by \nthe Strategy, Planning and Performance department (SPP).  Where other departments \n3  \nare involved in delivery of specific functions or services, this has been explained below \nwithin the section on boundaries with other departments.  \nStructure of the Strategy Planning & Performance Department  \n7. The Strategy Planning and Performance Department sits within the Corporate Services \nDirectorate.  The aim of the department is to ensure an organisational approach to \ncontinuous improvement through co-ordinated management information systems and \nplanning and performance review activity and the provision of strategic planning \nexpertise and advice in order to achieve best value.  \n8. There are three divisions of SPP, each of which  perform specific roles. However, due \nto the nature of the department, there is a considerable amount of collaborative \nworking in order to achieve the department’s objectives. The three divisions making up \nSPP are: Information Management, Performance Management and Performance Audit \nand Review.  \n9. The department was established in 2002 as a result of the recommendations in Review \nof Strategy, Planning and Performance Department  (FEP 273) . The structure was \ndesigned to support the corporate priorities of the Authority at that time and was in line \nwith the top management review (FEP 100) May 2002.  \n10. The role and responsibilities of SPP are: \na) Planning \n11. Management of the Authority’s corporate plan, best value performance plan and \nsupporting planning structures. Liaison and joint working with the GLA on performance \nissues and reporting to the Mayor’s office. Integration of financial and service planning \nand integration of equalities planning and impact assessment into strategic planning. \nb) External Liaison  \n12. Managing the organisation’s consultation and engagement strategy and co-ordination \nof interaction with stakeholders (public, corporate and legislative) regarding major \ninitiatives and forms of external consultation. (e.g. recent liaison regarding LSP2). It \nalso encompasses reporting and analysis of compliments and complaints. Managing \nexternal performance assessments. Some external consultation is conducted by other \ndepartments. \nc) Programme management \n13. Co-ordinating the range of projects, actions and initiatives that fall out of the corporate, \ndepartmental and borough plans. This is a key area that provides the tools for the \nmanagement and co-ordination of the Authority’s business activities and decisions on \npriorities for the allocation of resources.  \nd) Best value review work  \n14. This team have the responsibility for our statutory requirement to complete best value \nreviews. They also co-ordinate the organisation’s overall approach to performance \nreviews and provide a source of advice and good practice on performance review \nmethodology and techniques. Working with the Equalities Unit to assess the impact of \nrecommendations from reviews on our Equality and Diversity performance. \n4  \ne) Performance audit \n15. The team audit operational command systems operating within Fire & Community \nSafety Directorate. The audit team also support the Health & Safety Manager in \ncarrying out the programme of health and safety audits (an essential element of the \nsafety management system). The team also undertake other non-financial systems \naudits across the Authority (either as follow up work to best value reviews or in \nresponse to other high risk issues which may be identified through day to day \nmanagement and/or the planning processes). \nf) Information strategy and corporate information management projects \n(including e-government) \n16. This strategic level function produces, co-ordinates and monitors the Authority’s \ninformation strategy. It provides advice to CMB, Directors and Heads of Service on \ninformation management issues and provides specialist advice on these issues to  \nproject boards and teams for IT and non-IT based projects. This function also identifies \nstrategic/corporate management information requirements which feed into the IT \nbusiness systems work plan, business plans, etc. It also prepares and maintains the \nAuthority’s Electronic Government Strategy.  \n17. In conjunction with other departments it: \n• Assists in the education of staff and managers on the potential of information and \ninformation management (Head of Training and Development). \n• Promotes and supports the development of improved corporate information \nsystems for the collection, storage, management and presentation of information \n(Head of IT) \n \n• Acts as project sponsor for information management systems. \ng) Statistics and Performance Information \n18. This is the collation, preparation and analysis of performance and management \ninformation for use internally (such as regular reports to Best Value & Finance & \nProcurement Panels, Corporate Management Board etc)  as well as for the benefit of \nexternal stakeholders (GLA, ODPM etc). Oversees data sharing initiatives with partners \nlike the London boroughs, police, etc. It also provides a level of technical expertise to \nassist in the understanding and presentation of performance information and for the \nverification of data originating outside of the information management division. \nh) Data Management \n19. This is the data and system administration for key corporate applications. Manages and \npromotes the use of the Authority’s corporate gazetteer and relationship with the \nNational Land and Property Gazetteer hub. With the IT Department, prepares and \nmaintains a data dictionary, a meta-data repository and an enterprise data model. Sets \nand enforces data standards, policies and procedures to make sure data is captured in a \nway which allows correlation of data between different databases and systems. \nEnsures effective data cleaning and data quality protocols are in place and undertakes \ndata cleaning; develops requirements for data management tools. Plays a key role in \nthe development and rollout of new applications and new versions of existing \napplications. \n5  \ni) Knowledge management \n20. This is the development of strategies/policies for managing organisational knowledge \nand knowledge management techniques to improve decision making and \nmanagement. A key knowledge management tool is a robust and developing intranet \nsite through partnership working with the Head of Communications. This function also \nincludes the library, photographic processing services and management of the systems \nof instructions and directives. \nj) Document management \n21. Information (both paper and electronic based) needs to be maintained and managed in \nline with a clear records management strategy and policies. It provides a service for the \nstorage of inactive (non-current) records, and advises on the retention scheduling, \ndestruction and archiving of paper records of lasting historical interest (in conjunction \nwith the London Metropolitan Archive). Partnership working with the Head of Human \nResources also exists for the management of current (active) and non-current (inactive) \npersonal record files. The document management area also covers the central \nmailroom.  \nk) Business process improvement \n22. This is mainly management of the station-based computing projects (CoFS project) and \nthe lead on the development of IT systems and solutions which impact to improve on \nstation administration. The aim of this function is to remove the bureaucratic nature of \nstation administration and improve efficiency through the development of electronic \ninformation flows (e.g. electronic FDR1 and the removal of paper based reporting \nsystems). The area also is lead for key information systems (i.e. the staff attendance \nrecording system (StARS) and the incident recording information system (IRIS), and \nthe management of fire reports (FDR1s) and liaison with ODPM). \nl) Information access \n23. This is the management of all aspects of the Data Protection Act and Freedom of \nInformation Act by setting policy, providing guidance, advice and training and raising \nawareness. This function also manages the policies and guidance/advice to staff on \ninformation sharing and the associated issues relating to information security, codes of \npractice and the management of the policies and guidance in relation to the Regulatory \nof Investigatory Powers regulations and the Human Rights Act1998 (so far as they \nrelate to information access). \nm) Risk Information \n24. This is the management of data to support integrated risk management planning, \nincluding use of risk-based tools to plan and deliver systems to collect, collate and \nanalyse information about risk, thereby supporting development of London Safety \nPlans. It analyses and presents risk data in user friendly formats (e.g. maps) to make \ndata understandable.  It advises on and/or assists with projects which may support or \ncontribute data for risk management planning purposes and works with external \ncontacts to obtain and analyse data that will support risk management planning.  \nn) Strategy and policy development \n25. Support to other corporate projects including development and co-ordination of policy \noptions and writing policy papers.   Ensuring preparation of responses to external \nconsultation documents on corporate issues (eg Mayoral strategies and other GLA \nproposals, government white papers and other documents and the range of material \n6  \nreceived from the Audit Commission, Local Government Association, Association of \nLondon Government etc). The Head of Department plays a lead role in drafting the \nLondon Safety Plans and is secretary to the Corporate Management Board.  \nKEY ISSUES IDENTIFIED \nWhat has been done so far \n26. As part of the review process, the steering group, in conjunction with members of staff \nfrom SPP Department , has undertaken the basic fact finding work. Financial, staffing, \nand performance information has also been collated and is summarised in the baseline \nanalysis.  \n27. Other departments have been consulted seeking their views on the review, the key \nissues it needs to address and how they wish to be involved in further stages of the \nreview. The trade unions have been supplied with information and invited to make any \ncomments about the review and the issues it should address. Staff in SPP Department \nare being kept informed about the review process and they have been involved in the \nidentification of the key issues.  \nth\n28. A formal Challenge Day was held on the 6 December 2004 attended by external \norganisations and internal colleagues where they were invited to challenge the \nfunctions under review. A full list of attendees is contained within the Baseline Analysis \nin Appendix B. \n29. A FINDS message was sent to all fire authorities within the country requesting \ninformation on how they organise and manage similar functions. All of the replies to \nthis message will be examined, to identify questions to be followed up as to how these \nother organisations operate in relation to the agreed key issues as part of stage 2 of the \nreview. \n30. From the above sources a list of issues was drawn up for consideration by the project \nboard and steering group. The steering group analysed the list and taking into account \nthe information collected, they identified four key areas on which it is proposed the \nnext phase of the review should focus.  \n7  \n31. Four key issues have emerged from the preliminary work. These are: \n• Performance Management. \n• Programme Management. \n• Performance Audit. \n• Boundaries with other departments and structure. \n32. The long list  for the key issues is contained in appendix C.  \nThe Issues \nPerformance Management \n33. Performance management is a critical issue for the Authority.  Members will appreciate \nthat this was the only issue where the Audit Commission found as part of their Initial \nPerformance Assessment that “weaknesses outweigh strengths”.   Effective \nperformance management requires a co-ordinated planning process (risk based and \nlinked to the budget cycle) where objectives and improvement targets are identified at \nall levels of the organisation (Authority-wide, at departmental and borough level, down \nto team and individual performance targets).    Timely accurate and reliable \nmanagement information then needs to be available to enable managers to assess their \nprogress in achieving targets and – most importantly – identifying the reasons for any \ndifficulties in achieving targets and using all that information to take action to improve \nperformance in the future.  One of the most crucial issues however is the development \nof a performance management culture.    SPP department has a key role to play in \nseveral stages in this process – as do managers across the organisation.  \n34. The Audit Commission report states that ‘LFEPA recognises that it needs to move from \na culture of performance monitoring to one of performance management’. This was \nalso acknowledged in our own IPA self assessment.    \n35. This review provides an excellent opportunity to look in detail at how improvements \ncan be made in this essential process to tackle the known shortcomings. This ties in \nwell with the introduction of IPDS nationally and the separate work under way to \ndevelop an appraisal system for non-uniformed staff.  \n36. The Authority is committed to achieving Equality Standard level 5 and there are various \nassociated planning and corporate governance issues which need to be addressed \nduring the review.   \n37. All of the organisations attending the challenge day recognised this as an important \nissue and have undertaken work in this area.  The metropolitan police identify local \ntargets and then hold officers accountable against these rather than the corporate \naspirations. Other organisations (BT, and City of Westminster) used incentive \nmeasures to promote management intervention on performance issues.  \n38. West Midlands FRS require their managers to submit a direct action plan where \nproblems are identified in meeting agreed targets.  Action plans are audited by their \nperformance audit team and the performance results are published on their intranet \nsystem to promote competition among districts and stations.  Centrex and WMFRS \n8  \nalso suggested that the consistent failure of a performance target may indicate that the \ntarget is wrong and it needs to be challenged. \n39. The use of local targets was seen by all to be an effective method of giving ownership \nto the personnel involved. However, all participants stated that unless the targets are \nSMART (Smart, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Timed) and set in consultation \nwith the end service providers, their impact on improving performance can be limited. \n40. We already have systems in place to identify local issues and progress these through \nvarious planning systems, and some work has also been done to look at how our \nfinancial and business planning systems can be more integrated. This review provides \nus with the opportunity build on the work already undertaken in this area. \nProgramme Management  \n41. The need to address performance management issues is outlined above. However this \nneeds to be supported by a comprehensive programme management system based on \nsound project management principles. Currently, there is no centrally co-ordinated \napproach to programme or project management across the organisation. \n42. Although project management methodology (PRINCE2) is in use in the organisation for \nsome projects, there is no consistent  approach used for the majority of projects.  \n43. It is recognised that we need to improve the management and co-ordination of the \nAuthority’s business activities and the decisions on priorities for the allocation of limited \nresources. However, in order for this to be successful, we need to develop a shared \nunderstanding of programme management and agree how best to establish and roll out \nsuch a function across the Authority.  \n44. Work to address these issues has begun with the allocation of money to appoint a \nconsultancy firm via a report approved by the Authority on 15 April 2004 - Resources \nfor Modernisation of London's Fire Service (FEP 545).  \n45. Consultants were appointed  to deliver the following: \na) Identify options, and potential solutions for programme management, \nincluding possible IT based systems which must be consistent with the \nAuthority’s IT strategy \nb) Identify staffing and structural issues impacting on programme management \nand make recommendations for improvements \nc) Develop a strategy for implementation of identified solutions. \n46. The consultant’s report will be available by January, and the second stage of this review \nwill provide the opportunity to review their findings and propose effective \narrangements for the future, linked to wider performance management considerations.  \nThe recent budget review process also indicated that additional budget provision \nmight need to be made in 2005-06 for implementation of consultants’ \nrecommendations.     \n9  \nPerformance audit \n47. The performance audit team were established when the SPP Dept was set up in 2002 ( \nFEP273). The audit team were required, as an interim position, to provide cover on the \nincident command monitoring rota while the monitoring officer systems were \ndeveloped by the Operations Response Department. Once in place, the concept was \nthat the Performance Audit Team could, among other things, audit the effective \noperation of those systems attending incidents on a sample basis as necessary.   Work \nto set up incident command monitoring arrangements has taken longer than \nanticipated.   Although some good progress has been made, uniformed staff in the \nPerformance Audit Team are still spending a significant proportion of their time \nsupporting this key function (currently 31 days per person, per year).  \n48. With the exceptions of the LAS and WMFRS, the method we use to conduct incident \ncommand monitoring was considered atypical. While all the participants of the \nchallenge day had an audit function to assess system and financial matters, some \norganisations (City of Westminster and HMIC) were considering expanding their audit \nrole to include performance issues.  Generally, considerable interest in our process was \nexpressed by all attendees. \n49. LAS use a clinical audit team to audit call allocation (the action of call handling and \nresource deployment) and the correct clinical diagnosis by the ambulance crews. A \nsample of 10% of all calls is audited. Where performance issues are identified, local \ncorrective action is available through trainers posted at ambulance stations.  \n50. WMFRS uses a performance audit team to check the progress of the direct action plans \nput in place by local managers and complete station performance reviews (station \ninspections). They also audit any work that is undertaken as a result of any action plans \nfrom the CPA process. Two Divisional Officers are used to attend incidents and also \ncarry out performance reviews of command. The Information collected is fed into a \ndatabase and used for station / district comparisons. \n51. In addition to incident command monitoring the Performance Audit Team have carried \nout a programme of work principally around operational risk, although some systems \naudits (IT, absence control and COSHH) have also been carried out.   The Team also \nprovide support on health & safety audits.  \n52. There is of course a separate internal audit department in Finance Department (whose \nwork is monitored by the Finance & Procurement Panel). In addition, Community \nSafety carries out policy, procedure and performance audit and OP/CHSES conducts \nsafety audits.  The Performance Audit Team liaises closely with these other teams.  \n53. As the incident command monitoring role beds down within Fire & Community Safety \nDirectorate it would now be useful to look again at the organisation’s need for a \nperformance audit function, its potential role as part of a wide performance \nmanagement framework, and the best way in which such a function could delivered.  \n10  \nBoundaries with other departments \nExternal consultation and communications  \n54. Performance Management Division has responsibility for corporate co-ordination of \nconsultation activity. This arises from the Authority’s best value duty to consult.  They \nalso lead on corporate consultation activity relating to the London Safety Plan.   The \nresults of consultation and external stakeholder engagement are key pieces of \nperformance information and should help decision making around priorities. However, \ndifferent departments lead on different aspects of consultation e.g. Borough \nCommanders and local community engagement teams consult locally, Performance \nAudit and Review Division consult on best value reviews, Finance consult on budget, \netc.  No one department is responsible for managing stakeholders with a view to \ndeveloping more meaningful relationships and managing approaches from different \nparts of the Authority to the same external stakeholder.  The Communications \ndepartment maintain the spreadsheets with stakeholder names and addresses but at \npresent there is no process for linking the results of feedback from consultation or \nengagement exercises with this information. This limits the organisation’s ability to \ntarget engagement & consultation exercises, other than in the broadest sense, and \ninhibits organisational learning from engagement and consultation work. \n55. The results from the Challenge Day showed that a number of organisations (City of \nWestminster, Metropolitan Police and London Ambulance Service) have identified that \ntheir consultation activities can be divided into corporate or local level initiatives. \nCorporate matters (political lobbying, corporate initiatives) are dealt with through \ncentral management. Local consultation (community engagement) is devolved to their \nlocal management which is best placed to identify the ‘at risk’ groups (and those with \naccess to them) and engage with them. BT place all consultation with their regional \nmanagers as part of their overall responsibilities. Each of the organisations placed their \nconsultation process in different areas, with one, the City of Westminster, having \nmoved it between their communications and performance departments a number of \ntimes over recent years. All participants acknowledged that true consultation requires \nthe organisation to be receptive to the messages received and to react accordingly, and \nmany expressed the consequent view that the function of consultation belonged within \nthe performance function. \n56. Comparison with the West Midlands Fire and Rescue Service found that structurally, \nthey have a similar approach to consultation on their integrated risk management plan.  \nThe best value team are the lead for this consultation with support from other \ndepartments.  In addition they use external consultants to undertake some related \nwork.  \n57. The issue for this review is striking the appropriate balance between corporate co-\nordination of the consultation and engagement process and sharing of good practice \nand encouraging and supporting local initiatives which are delivering real benefits.  \nIM knowledge management team and Communications Department web team:  \n58. LFEPA’s Intranet site (hotwire) is potentially a key knowledge management tool over \nand above its role in communication. For this reason, many organisations (BT, City of \n11  \nWestminster and London Ambulance) manage their Intranet site within their \nknowledge management departments.  All the organisations attending the challenge \nday promoted the use of the intranet not just to aid communication but to help staff \nfind and share information and knowledge to aid better decision making and \nmanagement.  Additionally, the move towards an integrated approach to web content \nand document management requires the both the skills provided by knowledge \nmanagers and web managers for content selection, usability and navigation. Therefore \nthe question arises as to where the management of the content on the Intranet \n(Hotwire) site sits or whether better arrangements for co-operative working can be \ndevised. Each of the organisations we asked had different structures in place to \noversee their Intranet, and could provide no clear guidance. This issue will be \nexamined further during the comparison visits in stage two of this review.  \nInformation Management and IT Business Systems Group \n59. Information Management Division works closely with the IT Department’s Business \nSystem Group (BSG). BSG is responsible for procuring and delivering software systems \nto support business processes. Both IM and BSG are often represented on the same \nproject teams/boards managing IT based projects. There is good understanding of \neach others’ role and considerable synergy between the objectives which IM and BSG \nare trying to achieve, i.e. more corporate/joined-up systems, better use and availability \nof information, etc. This relationship was seen in a positive light during the challenge \nday for those attendees who still retained a non-strategic IT department (London \nAmbulance Service, Centrex, and Metropolitan Police Service). Those who have \noutsourced their technical IT support to users, networks and systems, (BT, City of \nWestminster) rely on their service providers to design, supply and support the systems \nthey require. However, over-arching strategy and client management of these \ncontracts is undertaken by an in-house information systems department and achieved \nthrough stringent service level agreements. In the Metropolitan Police Service, their \nInformation Systems Department includes aspect of information management as well, \nalthough some other activities are within the corporate governance area. There may be \nbetter ways of delivering business systems overall by reviewing the working \narrangements between IMD and BSG.  \nRelationship between SPP Department and AC Risk: \n60. The Authority decided in January 2004 (FEP 519) to designate an Assistant \nCommissioner with responsibility for Risk, within the Corporate Services Directorate. \nWhen taking that decision the Authority noted that “In particular bringing the role of \nAC Risk into the Corporate Services Directorate will require an examination of how it \nshould work with the current functions of the Strategy, Planning and Performance \nDepartment, because of their strong linkages with information management and \nperformance review in particular”. The Assistant Commissioner Strategic Risk has very \nfew staff (most of which are supernumerary) although there is a RNDF bid in the draft \n2005/06 budget to regularise the position of some of these posts. Currently, the AC \nRisk relies on staff seconded from other departments, principally Service Delivery and \nadditional support from staff within different parts of SPP Department in order to \ndeliver his responsibilities. \n12  \n61. Since the AC Risk post was established two staff from SPP Department have been \nworking to the AC Risk to provide support on the development of the London Safety \nPlan and  in the development of the organisational framework for corporate risk \nmanagement (including business continuity planning).  The Head of PARD also \nsupports AC Risk in the management of corporate risk work.  \n62. As part of this review it would now be timely to look more closely at the relationship \nbetween these groups of staff to ensure that best value is achieved in terms of \nefficiency and effectiveness.  \n63. A centralised approach to corporate risk issues and the difficulty in resourcing the \nteams doing this work was repeated in a number of organisations (WMFRS, LAS and \nMPS). The subject of corporate risk was seen by those attending the challenge day as \nan expanding and resource intensive activity. Three organisations (MPS, BT and \nCentrex) placed their strategic risk group within corporate services with a strong link \ninto their business continuity plans.  Two organisations (City of Westminster and \nGallagher Bassett) considered that strategic risk and business continuity should be \nintegrated into all corporate activities and monitored through the Comprehensive \nPerformance Assessment (CPA) process. There was however, unanimous recognition \nfrom every organisation that this is an area that must be addressed and resourced \nproperly. \nnd\n64. For the preparation of the draft 2 London Safety Plan (LSP2), Information \nManagement Division took on responsibility for investigating, manipulating and \npresenting risk information.  The most significant output of this work can be seen in the \nseries of ‘risk maps’ in appendix 4 of the draft LSP2.  Information Management Division \nhas also managed the detailed liaison with the consultants (ORH) working on \nemergency cover and risk modelling to support LSP2 and to assess the Fire Service \nEmergency Cover  (software) toolkit provided by the ODPM.   Decisions now need to \nbe taken about the Authority’s longer term approach to developing and resourcing its \nrisk and emergency cover modelling. There is an RNDF bid in the draft 2005/06 \nbudget to support this work. \nAccess to information (data protection and freedom of information):   \n65. IM deal with the small number of subject access requests received under the Data \nProtection Act. This works well given the present small volume of such requests. \nHowever the new general rights of access under the Freedom of Information Act came \ninto effect in January 2005.  Although it is too early to gain any clear idea of the number \nof requests for information which may be made it would be timely to consider the \noptimum organisational arrangements for dealing with such requests. \nProduction of performance/management information:  \n66. IM has access to all the LFEPA business systems/databases and produces regular \nreports (monthly/quarterly) to support management of the suite of performance \nindicators in the Best Value Performance Plan (BVPP). However, some other \ndepartments produce alternative reports which address some of their specific \nperformance indicators. As indicated in FEP 620, it has been necessary to supplement \nresources within Service Delivery to meet its management information needs to  \n13  \nsupport performance management at a local level. The longer term arrangements are \nunder consideration as part of the Action Plan arising from that review.  \n67. There is however evidence that the production of some information is being duplicated \nfor use in different areas (e.g HR). This is a common theme that was repeated in many \nof the organisations we looked at. As the setting of national targets by central \ngovernment requires data to be collected, all of the challenge day attendees agreed \nthat the important factor is how this data is interpreted. Not withstanding this, only one \norganisation (WMFRS) specifically employed a statistician to provide consistent \nanalysis of their performance information.  \n68. In addition, the need to improve the relationship between our corporate plan, \nindividual service plans, and borough plans has also been recognised. Work on these \nissues is in progress in line with the Authority’s decisions on that earlier best value \nreview.  However, there are comparable issues in relation to a number of other \ndepartments and these will be investigated further in the second stage of the review.  \n69. The resulting recommendations arising from the further investigation into the above \nkey issues will be fed into a review of the structure of the Strategy, Planning and \nPerformance department to determine the most effective, efficient and economic \ndeployment of resources to meet the Authority’s objectives. \nAREAS NOT INCLUDED \nStrategic Risk \n70. The work of the strategic risk group is not included within this review.  This is because \nthe group are still under development, and it would be preferable to review the area \nonce it is properly established.  Therefore, it is proposed that only the boundary issues \nthat relate to strategic risk are explored  \nFINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS \n71. At this stage scope for efficiency savings (either cashable or non-cashable) has not yet \nbeen identified. However the Authority has set a target for 2% savings to be identified \nacross the best value review programme as a whole, and the options for identifying \nsuch efficiency improvements within the Strategy, Planning and Performance \nDepartment review will be one focus for the next stages of this review, in particular \nwhen comparing with best practice and performance in other organisations. \nRECOMMENDATION \nnd\n72. This paper proposes that the 2 Stage of this review should focus on four key issues:- \n1. Performance Management  \n2. Programme Management \n3. Performance Audit   \n4.

Brief description of main services provided: \nPerformance Management Division leads on –  \n• Developing and implementing a performance management framework for the \norganisation \n• Management of the Authority’s corporate plan, best value performance plan \nand supporting planning structures via the departmental service plans \n• Managing external performance assessments \n• Supporting the Authority’s efforts to modernise the national framework within \nwhich the fire service operates including programme management of the \nmodernisation agenda \n• Liaison and joint working with the GLA on performance issues and reporting to \nthe Mayor’s office \n• Development and implementation of the Authority’s consultation and \ncommunity engagement strategy and managing major corporate consultation \nactivity including the consultation process for the London Safety Plan \n• Development, implementation and maintenance of a programme management \nframework for the Authority \n• Development and implementation of the Authority’s compliments and \ncomplaints arrangements \n• Overseeing arrangements under the confidential reporting (whistleblowing) \nprocedure \n• Support to other corporate projects including development of policy options \nand writing policy papers   \n• Ensuring preparation of responses to external consultation documents on \ncorporate issues (e.g. Mayoral strategies and other GLA proposals, \ngovernment white papers and other documents and the range of material \nreceived from the Audit Commission, Local Government Association, \nAssociation of London Government etc)  \n \nThe Performance Audit and Review Division is responsible for supporting continuous \nservice improvements across the Authority. This is achieved by conducting audits on our \noperational activities, and ensuring compliance with Best Value requirements by implementing \na concurrent programme of best value reviews. The division also supports work on corporate \nrisk management, supporting the development of a corporate risk management policy and \nframework and is leading on development of a corporate business continuity plan. \nIn particular, the division: \nLeads on the ongoing development and implementation of the performance audit and review \nframework and programme of best value performance reviews for the Authority, ensuring that \nit supports the strategic objectives of the organisation \n• Assists in the development of policy objectives for audit and performance review related \nareas \n20  \n• Undertakes the effective management of services, resources and materials in relation to \nperformance  audit and review and ensures their currency and applicability to the Authority \nand influencing issues \n• Maintains a good level of knowledge of the tools and techniques used in both audit and \nreview to deliver continuous improvement \n• Supports the corporate approach to service improvement including the Best Value regime, \nquality initiatives and preparations for Corporate Performance Assessment and any other \nsteps to audit/ review in-house services \n• Acts as facilitator on service improvement techniques such as best value review and \nperformance audit and related issues to ensure that experience and expertise is shared \nacross the Authority \n• Provides a source of advice and good practice on performance audit and review \nmethodology and techniques. \n• Supports the health and safety manager in undertaking audits of the Authority’s safety \nmanagement systems \n• Continues to provide support to Fire & Community Safety Directorate and Operational \nResponse Department on incident and command monitoring. \n \nThe Information Management Division (IM) was created in June 2002. It brought together \nactivities related to the management of information into a single organisational unit within the \nStrategy, Planning and Performance Department (Corporate Services Directorate).  \nIM has a corporate role in setting and managing policies on a range of information issues (e.g. \nInformation Strategy) and does this in conjunction with Directors and heads of service. IM is \nthe Authority’s expert in information management and provides services to other LFEPA heads \nof service in a similar way to HR, finance, procurement, communications, etc.  In addition to the \nsetting and monitoring of the information strategy and the policies that support it, IM delivers \nservices in a practical way to support both corporate needs (officers and Members) and the \nservice delivery needs of heads of service. IM makes sure that corporate priorities are reflected \nin the information management work and that a joined-up and integrated view is taken around \nthe support and development of information systems.  \nIM brings together people from different information disciplines. The aim is to apply sound \nmanagement principles to the life cycle of LFEPA’s information resources whatever the format \nor medium. This includes structured information (like databases) and unstructured information \n(like documents & images) and covers information coming from both inside and outside the \norganisation. \nIM’s key goal is to get the right information to the right person, at the right time, from the right \nsource (external or internal), in the right amount, in the right order, in the right form, in the \nright medium, as accurately and as quickly as possible – and at the lowest reasonable cost. \nKey measures of success will be: \n• all staff have ready access to all the information they need to do their jobs, at all levels in \nthe organisation. \n• our information assets are fully exploited, through information sharing within the \norganisation and with other public sector bodies, and through commercial arrangements \nwith the private sector where appropriate. \n• the quality of the organisation's information is maintained, and the information used to \nconduct our business is accurate, reliable, up-to-date, complete and consistent. \n21  \n• legal and other requirements for maintaining the privacy, security, confidentiality, \nauthenticity and integrity of information are observed, and requests for information are \nhandled within appropriate deadlines. \n• information is made available conveniently to the public through a variety of channels. \n• the public record and other essential information holdings are preserved.  \n \nAll functions, led by the Head of Department, contribute in various ways to strategy and policy \ndevelopment, providing support to other corporate projects including development and co-\nordination of policy options and writing policy papers.   Ensures the  preparation of responses \nto external consultation documents on corporate issues (eg Mayoral strategies and other GLA \nproposals, government white papers and other documents and the range of material received \nfrom the Audit Commission, Local Government Association, Association of London \nGovernment etc). The Head of Department plays a lead role in drafting the London Safety \nPlans and is secretary to the Corporate Management Board.  \n2. How are the services currently provided?   \nPerformance Management Division \nIn PMD there is a small team of directly employed staff with some external budget for \nconsultation activity and other consultancy support.   There are some temporary \nsupernumerary staff and there has been a budget supplementation in 2004-05 to reflect the \nincreased workload.  The staffing structure doesn’t now reflect the work that the team does.  \nHowever, the flexibility and adaptability of staff within the team mean that the transition from \nexpectations in 2002 (when the structure was established) and the current work balance has \nbeen managed effectively.  People in the team have wide ranging skills which mean they can \nmove between different areas of work easily and effectively.     \nPerformance Audit and Review Division \nThe Performance Audit and Review Division is headed by a PO2, overseeing three teams: \nReview; Audit: and Support. Two of the staff from the Audit team are currently seconded to \nwork within the Strategic Risk team to support delivery of corporate and operational risk \nstrategies. \nThe Review Team undertake best value reviews in line with the Local Government Act 1999.  \nThe Review Team also co-ordinates the organisation’s overall approach to best value reviews \nand provides a source of advice and good practice on performance review methodology and \ntechniques. Each member of the Review team leads on one review at a time and these usually \ntake between 9 – 12 months to complete.  A five-year best value review programme was \nagreed in 2000 which will be completed in 2005/06. A new programme will be developed by \nthe end of 2004/05. \nThe Audit team’s audits vary in duration depending on the area under review, and usually take \nbetween 4 and 8 months.   There is no medium or long term agreed programme of audits at the \nmoment. The Head of PARD receives requests for audits and for support on audits being led \nby other departments (particularly Health and Safety) from other Heads of Service.   This, \ntogether with priorities identified by PARD are discussed with the relevant Heads of Service \nand then prioritised in agreement with the Head of SPP and the Director of Corporate Services.  \nThe Support Team provides a research and administrative support capability to both groups to \nensure that the time of the officers engaged in the Audit and Best Value work is utilised to \nmaximum effect. \n22  \nBest Value review work \nBest Value reviews have two main stages: \n• the diagnostic review whereby the selected service is examined and areas where \nimprovements are most likely to be needed are identified \n• a full review of key issues identified during the diagnostic stage \n \nThe diagnostic stage of the review uses the four Cs (challenge, comparison, consultation and \ncompetition) to assess the service and identify opportunities for efficiency savings.  The full \nreview further investigates these issues and results in recommendations and the production of \na final report and action plan.   The trades unions are involved throughout the review process.  \nBoth stages are reported to the Best Value Panel and the final report goes to the Authority for \napproval. \nPerformance audit \nThe Audit Team carries out a number of audits to ensure that control systems are working, \nTraditionally these audits have been based around operational issues, but the Audit Team have \nbeen developing their capacity to undertake other non-financial systems audits across the \nAuthority (either as follow up work to best value reviews or in response to other high risks \nwhich may be identified through day to day management and/or the planning processes).  The \nAudit Team also supports the Health and Safety Manager as necessary in carrying out the \nprogramme of health and safety audits. \nAll audits undertaken by the Audit Team encompass the core values of: \n• Fitness for purpose \n• Health and Safety \n• Risk Assessment \n• Equality and Diversity \n• Continual Improvement \n \nThe Head of PARD and the Lead Auditor will liaise with the relevant parties to determine the \nsubject of the proposed audit and agree its purpose and scope. This is confirmed in an agreed \nbrief for each audit setting out the specific audit objectives, the audit criteria and the target \ndates (start and finish of audit). \nOnce all preparation and fieldwork has taken place, the results will be analysed in order to \nidentify the key issues.  Any discrepancies will be noted along with the reasons identified for \nand difficulties in meeting  the expected standard.  An audit report and action plan will then be \ndrawn up to address these identified shortcomings and to promote continual improvement.   A \ntime scale is set for proposed for remedial action.  \nThe report and action will be discussed and agreed with : \n• Individuals responsible for implementing agreed actions; \n• Heads of Departments affected by agreed actions and/or recommendations; \n• Heads of Service affected by agreed actions and/or recommendations; \n \nIncident Command Monitoring and Audit Role (DOII Only) \n23  \nThe Audit Team was set up in 2002, taking on part of the responsibilities of the former  \nOperations & Training Performance Inspectorate (OTPI).   The OTPI had been set up following \nthe Improvement Notices issued by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) in 1991.  They had a \nresponsibility for monitoring and auditing operational readiness and effectiveness of command \nand performance at incidents and during training.  To discharge this role officers from OTPI \nattended all incidents to which 6 or more pumps were mobilised, all cylinder and chemical \nincidents and any 4 pump incidents of special interest.  \nWhen PARD was set up the Authority agreed that the responsibility for setting up and running \na formal monitoring process for operational command should pass to the Fire & Community \nSafety Directorate (and additional resources were provided to Operational Response \nDepartment to enable them to take on this lead responsibility). This process was to be \nsupported by officers from the Performance Audit & Review Team by auditing the systems \nthrough sampling. \nHowever as this is a safety critical function, it was further agreed that during the transition to \nthe proposed arrangements the Area Managers within PARD, together with officers from \nOperational Response Department, would  continue to provide a high level monitoring service \nuntil the formal monitoring process is well established across the operational function.   These \ninterim arrangements were designed to maintain the same functions and level of cover as \npreviously provided by the OTPI.  These interim arrangements are still largely in place, with \nthree of the original four officers continuing to provide this support which takes up an average \nof just over 30 working days per officer per year. PARD are working with Operational Response \nto phase out the remaining interim arrangements. \nThe three officers in PARD provide cover across three of the four watches and, in conjunction \nwith other officers as determined by Operational Response, they continue to attend all \nincidents of certain types (see above).  Their role is to gather information about the \nperformance of incident command and to assess compliance with procedures.  They also still \nattend Performance Review of Command meetings (PRCs), which are held for all incidents of 6 \npumps and above, where their role is to provide any relevant information that they have \ngathered from the incident and to assist the chair to arrive at any learning or good points \nworthy of further discussion. They maintain the Incident Management Project (IMP) database \nwhich records a command summary and operational monitoring information gathered at the \nincident and a summary of the PRC. They also continue to attend and assess incident command \ntraining simulations and other training exercises. \n24  \nInformation Management Division \nInformation strategy and corporate information management projects (including e-\ngovernment) \n• Produces, co-ordinates and monitors the information strategy. \n• Identifies strategic/corporate management information requirements which feed into the \nIT business systems work plan, business plans, etc.  \n• Provides advice and support as required on information management issues. \n• Assists in the education of staff and managers about the potential of information  \n• Promotes and supports the development of improved corporate information systems for \nthe collection, storage and presentation of information  \n• Manages (with Head of IT) a clearing house for all information system ideas/proposals to \nensure (a) better links between existing and future computer systems; (b) greater \nexploitation of data; and (c) improvements to data/information capture and handling  \n• Leads on and co-ordinates e-government/electronic service delivery initiatives; prepares \nand maintains the Authority’s Electronic Government Strategy.  \n• Establishes a data warehousing strategy to support performance management and decision \nsupport [with Head of IT] \n \nStatistics and performance information \n• Collates and prepares performance and management information reports for \nDepartmental/Directorate Boards (as required), Corporate Management Board and the \nAuthority (its panels and committees) and for managers generally. \n• Undertakes trend/descriptive analysis of performance information/data to support \nmanagers, the annual target setting process and development of new indicators. \n• Provides specialist expertise/services in presenting performance information and statistics \n– documents, graphs, web pages, mapping (e.g. LSP borough profiles). \n• Develops partnerships and joint working on the collection, collation, and analysis of \ninformation with other agencies (like the GLA, London Boroughs, LASS, ODPM, etc) ; \n• Establishes and maintains policies for data/information sharing with other agencies and \ncollaborates with other agencies to share data (e.g. project LASS) and exploit external \ndata sources for the benefit of the Authority. \n• Undertakes (or commissions from external organisations) specific research and studies. \n• Validates statistical information produced outside IM before publication.  \n• Works with Directors, heads of service and external agencies (like ODPM) on the \ndevelopment of new performance indicators. \n \nMapping and web presentation \n• Sets-up and maintains pages on external and internal web sites presenting performance \nand statistical information about LFEPA and other services provided by IM;  \n• Leads on the development/maintenance of a geographic information systems (GIS) \nstrategy and acts as the Authority’s Ordnance Survey Liaison Officer (OSLO). \n• Supports GIS users across the Authority, and manages the GIS board and user group. \n \n25  \nInformation access \n• Manages the impact of the Data Protection Act setting policy, providing guidance,  advice \nand training;  and deals with all DPA subject access requests; supports staff/managers on \nthe impact of DPA.

Which other services in the Authority are integral to your service delivery? \nAll. PMD manage the corporate planning and performance framework. IM manages a variety of \ninformation processes that touch on all other departments of the organisation. In particular, IM \nworks very closely with the IT Department (Business Systems Group).  \nThe best value programme must  review all functions within the Authority. The performance \naudits are focussed on the operational departments and issues, but can have a wider remit \ndepending on the area of audit (for example absence control). \nAuditors undertaking the incident command monitoring role (Group Manager) work closely \nwith the incident management division in Operational Planning. Operational management of \nthe officers is provided by the SDO  in that department. \n4.

What targets are in place and how are they measured? \nSee appendix 1. \n10. How does this service contribute to the Authority’s Principal Aim of “ \nMaking London a safer city…. “? \nOur overall departmental objective is to ensure an organisation wide approach to continuous \nimprovement through co-ordinated management information systems and planning and \nperformance review activity and the provision of strategic planning expertise, information and \nadvice in order to achieve best value. Without such a managed approach to continuous \nimprovement, the organisation’s effectiveness and efficiency would be impaired which would \nhave a detrimental effect on achievement of its principal aim. All of our work involves \npromoting corporate objectives, and making firm links between the Authority’s principal aim \nand service standards and the work carried out throughout the Authority. \n11. What are the critical success factors for this service? \nMeeting statutory requirements \nFlexibility \nBetter decision making based on risk   \nGood liaison arrangements \nPolitical awareness \nProvision of timely and accurate  information \nProductive working relationships \nCredibility \nKeeping on top of emerging information/developing situations \nContribution to overall Authority objectives \nEnabling the Authority to be reflected in the best light – contribution to confidence in strong \ncorporate governance, efficiency and effectiveness.   \nUnderstanding stakeholder needs and drivers \n \n34  \n12. Is this service provided because of any legal requirements, or because of \nnational or Authority policies? \nAn overall approach to external performance assessment is needed.  There are statutory \nrequirements relating to production of the IRMP, performance information and the BVPP and \nto consult with the public. The Authority is required to supply statistical returns and \nperformance information to government, GLA, and other bodies. \nThe Authority has duties under both the Data Protection and Freedom of Information Acts \nwhich govern access to information and these duties need to be managed to ensure the \nAuthority complies fully. The proper management of records (both paper and electronic) is a \nrequirement flowing from the statutory Code of Practice issued by the Lord Chancellor under \nthe Freedom of Information Act.  \nAs a Best Value Authority, the Authority must make arrangements to secure continuous \nimprovement in the way in which its functions are exercised, having regard to a combination of \neconomy, efficiency and effectiveness, which will include performance reviews. The best value \nreview programme also contributes to meeting the Authority’s fiduciary duty through the target \nto identify 2% financial savings across the areas subject to review (either cashable or non-\ncashable). \nIncident command monitoring was established following the issue of the HSE Improvement \nNotices LFB1 and LFB2 to provide a monitoring system and an independent audit function to \ncollect information for principal management about the quality of operations and training \nperformance. \n13. Who are the users of this service? \nMembers;  corporate management board;  principal managers; staff;  Audit Commission;  \nexternal auditor;  external stakeholders (eg, GLA, ODPM) \n14. What effect would there be on the Authority’s service delivery if this \nservice was not provided at all? \nSee above re contribution to principal aim.  Some statutory requirements not met, in particular, \nthe requirement to publish the BVPP and the undertaking of best value reviews. Production of \nthe IRMP (as called for by the National Framework) would also be inhibited. \nThe Authority, and its operational staff, would be exposed to increased risks were PARD to \ncease its involvement in incident command monitoring before alternative arrangements are \nfully in place and if auditing of operational performance were to cease. \n35  \n15. What opportunities or threats do you envisage for the service over the \nshort to medium term? \nModernisation indicates significant change in the organisation. This change needs to be \nmanaged in a co-ordinated and effective way, providing an opportunity for improved cohesion, \nand delivery can be supported by means of best value reviews and audits. It is also a chance to \nexamine the information we hold and the information we need in order to continue delivering \nan effective and efficient Fire & Rescue Service. Development of our information systems will \nenable us to exploit the full potential of the information required to support change within the \norganisation. Programme management consultancy provides the opportunity to develop new \nsystems for prioritisation and resource allocation to reflect the rigour needed in our new \nsituation.  \nOur new planning database available via the intranet provides an improvement opportunity in \ncommunication of developments in planning that we’ve taken forward. \nIPA improvement planning will create an opportunity to drive forward the performance \nmanagement framework and this, along with the new guidance on best value and performance \nimprovement for fire authorities, will enable us to maximise the benefits of best value reviews \nand the use of performance information within the organisation.  \nIndividual performance appraisal and IPDS provide opportunities for performance management \nto be fully integrated into the organisation although there are still some issues about overall \nlead responsibility. \nThe national framework 2005/06 publishes a revised set of Best Value Performance Indicators \n(BVPIs) and new national targets. This improved suite of BVPIs will allow us to further develop \nthe range of information presented to managers for performance management purposes and \nwill assist us in monitoring and delivering key national priorities.  \nLSP2 includes a programme of research to be undertaken during 2005/06. This will allow us to \nfurther our knowledge on key service delivery areas such as community safety and managing \nrisk.   \nThis best value review provides additional opportunities to develop the consultation and \nengagement function which has been neglected by the organisation and to provide intellectual \nleadership to it and position it firmly in its performance context; although some may consider \nthat the consultation & engagement function might more sensibly sit with the Communications \nfunction. LSP consultation & engagement could sit with the Strategic Risk team (responsible for \nproduction of LSP) in line with other consultation and engagement activity which is carried out \nwithin service departments.   \nPARD work programmes could become more strongly risk-based and focussed. This could \ninclude: assessing the impacts of reviews and audits; providing best practice advice on \nreview/audit techniques to others; commencing third party (service suppliers) audits on behalf \nof other departments. \nInformation Access requirements governed by the Data Protection Act, Freedom of \nInformation Act and the Code of Practice on Records Management provide further \nopportunities to live by our core values of openness and honesty as well as ensuring that our \ninformation assets are organised in the most efficient way. \n36  \nThe Information Integration Project and data warehousing strategy will allow staff at all levels to \naccess a range of information in a manner that has not been previously possible. This will \nimprove the information available to support service delivery, planning and performance \nmanagement. \nWe have responded to changes in the external environment by being flexible and adaptable \nand embracing change.  There will be more opportunities for this in the future. \nThe creation of a medium to long term audit programme would raise the team’s profile and \nimprove effectiveness and the morale of the performance audit team. \nThe Best Value Review itself provides an opportunity to review arrangements in the light of \nexperience since the division was established. Specialist skills are often required for a number \nof posts within SPP and experience has shown that it can take some time to develop the levels \nof knowledge required to maximise performance. A significant number of leavers would \njeopardise the services we provide. \n16. What are the constraints on improving the service’s efficiency and \neffectiveness? \nTime and resources to deliver SPP’s broad range of functions and responsibilities, for example \nwhere there has been insufficient focus before or when statutory requirements demand \nsignificant change in the way we manage our information assets. In particular, IM has a large \ndependency on IT to deliver improved information systems. \nConflicting priorities for the organisation and others‘ ability and/or willingness to engage in our \nareas of work and to embrace the corporate benefits. For example, departments can have \ndifficulty supporting and responding to the process and the outcomes of reviews and audits in \na congested change management agenda. \nThe lack of an agreed basis and framework for performance audit means that the work has a \nlow profile in some parts of the organisation and its value is not always recognised.  \nThe flat reporting structure within PARD is inefficient and does not support teamwork or the \ndevelopment of staff. The PARD support office function has not developed well and this may \nbe partly a result of the structure, which does not integrate the support function within the \nother two teams. \n17. What alternative methods of service delivery are there?  \nPrivate sector – management consultancies – could provide many of the services, for example: \nprogramme management, records management and best value reviews.   External \nconsultancies are currently used to run consultation activity.     \nBest value reviews and performance audits could be undertaken by other departments, for \nexample: departments could lead their own best value reviews and internal audit could have a \nrole in performance audit. The programmes of reviews and audits could be structured \ndifferently. Information management functions could be dispersed across all relevant \ndepartments. \n37  \n18. What are the benefits of providing this service in house? \nMany of the services provided are integral to corporate processes and procedures and it would \nbe difficult to extricate them for a private sector contract.  As noted, there has been (and with \nmodernisation there will continue to be) a good deal of change which the organisation needs to \nmanage, and SPP has the knowledge, expertise and effective working relationships with other \ndepartments to support this.   Flexibility is key to managing peaks and troughs in Authority \nworkloads and SPP staff often work across team boundaries to support and deliver projects as \ndemand dictates. \nA good deal of information handled is sensitive and confidential, and if the services were \ncontracted out, there would be likely to be needed a larger than typical client/core side to \nmanage the contract and to handle this information. It is also unlikely that retrieval and \nmanipulation of data could be provided by the private sector given the broad range of time-\ncritical information requests we receive and the evolving nature of our corporate applications. \nWithout a best value team the centre of expertise and knowledge about the best value process \nwould be lost.  This could lead to inconsistencies between reviews and would place a greater \nburden on other departments who have a role in ensuring that the reviews meet legislative and \nbudgetary requirements and that the reporting complies with Members’ expectations. It would \nbe more difficult to disseminate good practice and to evaluate the benefits of the programme.  \nExternal consultants are sometimes used to support elements of best value reviews and \nexperience suggests that use of consultants to deliver the best value programme would be \nmore expensive than an in-house service.  External consultants would also need a longer lead-\nin time for reviews in order to gain sufficient knowledge of the organisation to develop realistic \nrecommendations.    \nThe knowledge and experience provided by the uniformed officers in the Performance Audit \nand Review team provides credibility to recommendations made about operational issues.  \n19. Potential Equalities Implications \nOpportunities to make significant contribution to the equality & diversity agenda via planning \nand programming, consultation and performance are considerable.  \nConsultation is a key area where equalities considerations need to be taken into account, in \nterms of ensuring accessibility, representation, inclusion of traditionally excluded groups. PMD \nalso co-ordinates planning and information gathering on other Departments’ consultation, \ncommunity engagement and outreach work – and this work also has strong links to equalities. \nCorporate planning processes and information systems have been developed/continue to \ndevelop to support the monitoring of LFEPA’s equalities agenda – which will allow officers in \nother departments to spend less time on collating data and completing forms and to work on \nequalities areas. \nAll best value reviews consider equalities and diversity issues in relation to the service under \nreview.  For example, the review will make sure that the impact on any of our target groups is \nunderstood before changes to the way in which the service is delivered are recommended. \nWhere possible, access to the service is improved. \n38  \n20. Potential procurement opportunities  \nSignificant procurement opportunities are linked to IM’s role in the development of information \nsystems. This might include completely externalising the service. However, other opportunities \nare minimal unless the functions were completely externalised. \n21. Sustainable Development  \nAs with the equalities and diversity agenda, our corporate role provides significant \nopportunities to contribute to organisational and national priorities.  This includes the \nenvironmental and sustainability agenda . \nIM produces a considerable amount of data both London-wide and more locally covering \ntopics such as the built environment, deprivation and demography. This information is used to \nmake decisions about how we tailor services to local needs and support the sustainability and \ndevelopment of local communities. Sustainable development is also a component of both Best \nValue Review and Audit work.   \n22. Health and Safety \nAs with equalities and diversity and environmental and sustainability agendas,  our corporate \nrole provides significant opportunities to contribute to organisational and national priorities.  \nThis includes the health and safety agenda. \nCorporate Planning processes have been developed to streamline monitoring processes for the \nHealth, Safety and Environmental Action Plan. The performance audit arrangements help to \nensure that health and safety management systems are working as intended and delivering the \nrequired results. IM work with Health & Safety to ensure the key health and safety priorities are \nmonitored and performance managed. \nThe Best Value Process \nChallenge \nThe challenge day for strategy, planning and performance was held on the 6 December, where \nrepresentatives from both internal Authority staff and external service users were invited to \nchallenge the functions provided by the Authority in relation to strategy, planning and \nperformance. The companies and organisations represented were: \n \nMetropolitan Police Service \nLondon Ambulance Service \nCity of Westminster \nWest Midlands Fire and Rescue Service (apologies) \nGallagher Bassett \nHMIC \nBT \nPost Office (apologies) \nEasy Group (apologies) \nThames Water (apologies) \nCentrex \nODPM \n \n39  \nInternal attendees were provided by; \n \nPerformance audit and review \nInformation management  \nPerformance Management \nService Delivery \nCorporate Risk (apologies) \n \nAll brigades, via FINDS, were asked about their arrangements for providing strategy, planning \nand performance functions. Responses were received from: West Midlands Fire Service; \nStrathclyde Fire Brigade; East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service; Lancashire Fire & Rescue \nService; Lothian and Borders Fire Brigade; Gloucestershire Fire & Rescue Service; \nLeicestershire Fire and Rescue Service and South Yorkshire Fire Service. These responses will \nbe followed-up in the second stage of the review. \n \nConsultation \nThis best value review commenced in October 2004, consequently there has been limited time \nto carry out detailed consultation as part of this first stage report. However internal consultation \nhas taken place with the Executive team and all Heads of Service; staff in the Strategy Planning \nand Performance department and the representative bodies. \n \nIt is proposed to continue the above consultation in greater depth and further meetings with \nstaff and the representative bodies are being arranged. Further consultation, including external \n(other best value authorities, commercial and other businesses, including organisations in the \nvoluntary sector, also service users and potential supplier), will be arranged as part of the \nsecond stage of the review. \n \nComparison. \nComparison at this early stage of this best value review has centred on initial findings from the \nChallenge Day, internal data collection and the data supplied in response to the FINDS \nmessage. External comparison visits are planned with fire brigades and other organisations, \nincluding some of those who attended the Challenge Day. Comparisons with private and \nvoluntary organisations will be also be made, where possible through the connections made at \nthe challenge day event.  \n \nCompetitiveness \nIt is too early in the review process to accurately measure the competitiveness of LFEPA’s \nstrategy, planning and performance functions. How competitiveness can be accurately \nmeasured has been discussed with representatives of Procurement Department as part of the \nfirst stage report. Further work is planned to discuss procurement and competition issues in \nmore detail particularly when information is available to compare with best practice and \nperformance in other organisations. \n40  \n \n Appendix 1 \nPerformance Indicators Reporting Method Performance Target Changes \nperiod \nProvide Services to meet users needs       \nValue for Money – Per capita spend on Strategy Performance and      \nPlanning \nReport every six months on achievement of standards on compliments NOW REPORT TO CMB & HRE PANEL met  None \nand complaints (See below) ANNUALLY \nMonitoring survey of satisfaction with complaints handling conducted Six monthly Survey undertaken & outcome reported in    \nevery six months. annual report (see above) \nProduction of annual consultation strategy Annually Report to Authority  Not met owing to July 2004 None \nresourcing  \nProduction of quarterly service and financial monitoring reports Quarterly Report to F&P Panel Met  None \nMeet the timetable for responding to consultation papers including the As needed Responses  as  appropriate    \nMayor’s strategies on 100% of occasions \nProduction of annual BVPP Annually Report to BV Panel & Authority  Met  None \nAgreed Audit programme completed Annual Manual – compared with agreed Met As per  None \nprogramme programme \n100% of Best Value Review programme delivered on time Annual Manual – compared with agreed Met As per  None \nprogramme programme \n100% Best Value Review Final report recommendations accepted by Annual Manual - Authority minutes  1   \nAuthority recommendation \noutstanding \nNo adverse comments about best value reviews in CPA reports or other Annual Manual – CPA report, Annual Audit letter, Met   \nexternal assessments external audit reports \nPublish quarterly digest of Performance Indicators – provisional data Quarterly Manual – comparing dates of publication.

Supporters of the ousted President were allegedly responsible for some of the killings while others demonstrators were reportedly shot by members of the National Guard.\n\n\n\"The killing and injuring of protestors is a gross violation of human rights and must be thoroughly investigated by the authorities to ensure that all those responsible are brought to justice,\" Amnesty International said. \"It is vital that the events are fully clarified to establish the chain of command responsibility that led to the deaths and injuries of so many people.\"\n\n\n\"It is also imperative that constitutional safeguards and fundamental human rights are not violated in the search for those responsible,\" the organisation added.\n\n\nAfter removing their support for ex-president Chávez, and demanding his resignation and that of his government, the Armed Forces established and military-civilian government, with leader of the business association, Fedecamaras, Pedro Carmona, as the interim president of the country.\" This government must publicly commit itself to to protect human rights and other constitutional guarantees,\" said Amnesty International.\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nHugo Chávez, an ex-army paratrooper, was reelected president in 2000 on a radical populist platform with a landslide victory. However, in the last year his popularity began to slide and opposition to his political agenda increased.\n\n\nOn 9 April 2002 unions and the business associations, Fedecamaras, called a national strike, which on 11 April was made indefinite. A mass demonstration calling for Chávez's resignation was called for 12 April. According to reports over 150,000 demonstrators took part. During the protest, a group of gunmen, identified as members of Chávez's political movement, reportedly opened fire on demonstrators. Nearer the Presidential palace civilian gunmen reportedly shot at protestors and members of the National Guard, Guardia Nacional, reportedly also opened fire on demonstrators. Ex-president Chávez has been accused of ordering the violence.\n\n\nThe armed forces reportedly withdrew support for Hugo Chávez in response to the violence and the apparent intention of the ex-president to order the security forces to take further steps to disperse the demonstration. Hugo Chávez was taken by the heads of the armed forces to the military barracks, Fuerte Tiuna, where he reportedly signed his resignation and dismissed his government, including the Vice-president. Reports indicate he is being held in the barracks.   \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n\t\t     \n\n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n\nhomemedia centre...take action...about ai...join ai...how to give...education...library...about this site...members...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n    \n    \n        main stories\n    \n        news by date\n    \n        media awards\n    \n        letters to the press\n    \n        comment articles\n    \n        diary notices\n    \n        news mailing list\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        current actions\n    \n        ongoing campaigns\n    \n        get active\n    \n        urgent action\n    \n        special interest networks\n    \n        local groups\n    \n        youth & student groups\n    \n        trade unions\n    \n        worldwide appeals\n    \n        political lobbying\n    \n        events\n    \n        ai works\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        contact aiuk\n    \n        what ai does\n    \n        ai works\n    \n        ai history\n    \n        ai faq\n    \n        about aiuk\n    \n        aiuk policy\n    \n        aiuk n ireland\n    \n        aiuk scotland\n    \n        aiuk wales\n    \n        aiuk links\n    \n        aiuk jobs\n    \n        contact ai worldwide\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        join now\n    \n        why join?\n    \n        work for ai\n    \n        volunteer for ai\n    \n        individual campaigners\n    \n        local groups\n    \n        youth & student groups\n    \n        urgent action\n    \n        join a network\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        join\n    \n        donate\n    \n        give as you spend\n    \n        buy something\n    \n        fundraise\n    \n        aiuk & money\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        youth groups\n    \n        student groups\n    \n        teaching resources\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        campaigns\n    \n        annual rpts\n    \n        by country\n    \n        by theme\n    \n        books\n    \n        educational\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        welcome\n    \n        local action\n    \n        individual campaigners\n    \n        local groups\n    \n        networks\n    \n        trainers\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n\n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n",

The campaign received widespread coverage in the national and regional TV, radio and press. It was followed shortly after by the announcement of a government investigation into the issue, which also received significant coverage. \n\nThe results of the government investigation were published in June this year, when postcode prescribing and CancerBACUP's view on the results again made headline news.\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\t\t \t\t\n\n\n\n  < prev  |    page 15 of 16    |  next >\n\n\n\n\nPage last modified: 02 November 2005\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tIn this section\n\n  \tInsurers failing cancer patients\n\tChoice of where to die\n\tCurrying favour\n\tPlan for teenagers' website\n\tEastEnders cancer storyline\n\tCancer at work campaign\n\tHelp with decisions\n\tRose supports CancerBACUP\n\tService users become benefactors \n\tVolunteers help\n\tPatients help nurses help patients\n\tFirst prize to CancerBACUP\n\tFilm as therapy\n\tProstate cancer treatments video\n\tAward for campaigners\n\tTribute Funds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n      \n        \tOrder publications\n\tWays to donate\n\n\n      \n\n    \n\n    \n  \n    \n    \n\n    You are in:\n                            \n                      \n              HOME\n             \n                          > \n                                                                  \n                      \n              NEWS\n             \n                          > \n                                                                  \n                      \n              NEWSLETTER\n             \n                                                      \n\n\n  \n\n\tABOUT US\n\tSITEMAP\n\tSEARCH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \tNewsletter\n  \tIssue 54\n\n\tIssue 53\n\n\tIssue 52\n\n\tIssue 51\n  \tHeadline\n\n\tNews from CancerBACUP\n  \n\tPatient's story\n\n\tReaders write\n\n\tPublication news\n\n\tFundraising & Service development\n\n\tPractical help\n\n\tMedical\n\n\n\n \n\tIssue 50\n\n\tIssue 49\n\n\tIssue 48\n\n\tIssue 47\n\n\tIssue 46\n\n\tIssue 45\n\n\tIssue 44\n\n\tIssue 43\n\n\tIssue 42\n\n\tIssue 41\n\n\tIssue 40\n\n\tIssue 39\n\n\tIssue 38\n\n\tIssue 37\n\n\tIssue 36\n\n\tIssue 35\n\n\tIssue 34\n\n\tIssue 33\n\n\tIssue 32\n\n\tIssue 31\n\n\tIssue 30\n\n\tIssue 29\n\n\tIssue 28\n\n\tIssue 27\n\n\tIssue 26\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\tAbout cancer\n\tCancer type\n\tTreatments\n\tResources & support\n\tTrials\n\tHealth professionals\n\tNews\n\tGet involved\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n    \n  \n    \n\n    \n      \tABOUT US\n\tCONTACT US\n\tORDER PUBLICATIONS\n\tWAYS TO DONATE\n\tSITEMAP\n\tTERMS & CONDITIONS\n\tPRIVACY STATEMENT\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    produced by jamkit\n\n    © copyright cancerBACUP 2003\nregistered charity number 1019719\n    \n    \n  \n\n  \n\n   \n\n   \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n",

Nowhere are the failings and broken promises of Labour more articulately illustrated.\n\n\n\nI make no secret of my desire to see our Health Minister here in Wales follow the reluctant example set by Beverly Hughes last night. Sadly, where the Health Minister is concerned, the buck barely even slows down as it passes Ms Hutt's desk!\n\n\n\nIt speaks volumes that those once 'safe' Welsh MP's have woken up to the irony - the inept Labour-run National Assembly Government will cost them the trust of the people at the next general election. \n\n\n\nPeople have seen the waiting list figures double, people have seen their council tax bills soar, and I think people can judge for themselves whether we now have a better Wales.\n\n\n\nThe crux of public services failure and the breakdown of effective governance is to me rather glaring - the hands of frontline staff are tied. There is too much emphasis on input and targets - almost none on output and delivery. \n\n\n\nInterference is the motto of Jane Hutt - she has the number of civil servants working for her department - expenditure on administration seems almost 'in-fashion' amongst Assembly Ministers, with her as the trend setter.\n\n\n\nEvery two and a half days, a welsh-health service circular is issued - doctors do not have time to implement the first set of instructions before the next arrives from the Cardiff Health Department.\n\n\n\nThe result is of this flawed approach is simple - 307,000 people are left waiting on a waiting list. 300,000 pounds every day wasted on patients who cannot be transferred to an appropriate care bed. \t\t\n\n\n\nA service choked and clotted with administration.\n\n\n\nAnd all the time, more paper, more targets, more instructions and more bureaucrats. \n\n \n\nThe Conservative answer is simple - freedom.\n\n\n\nFreedom from the restrictions and tethers of central, bloated government. \n\nFreedom for doctors to prioritise how only they can know best. Resources direct to the frontline where it is so desperately needed. \n\nAnd freedom from the 'government knows best' idea and the 'cult of managerialism' that is so central to Labour today.\n\nAnd the challenge to the flawed belief that spending equates to achievement.\n\n\n\nPoliticians must not micro-manage the health service. I would not dream of telling a consultant who has worked for 30 years how he or she should prioritise their workload.\n\n\n\nI sincerely hope that when Mr Blair decides on the date for the next general election - that all those Labour voters here in Wales and across Britain undergo a winter of common sense and come to realise just who has been in charge for the last 7 years - who is to blame for the state this country today.\n\n\n\nRather than take the reins of government, they have panicked, dodged and blamed others for an accelerating demise. Labour are no friends of public services - police will tell you they spend much of their time form filling; teachers  and doctors worrying about targets and guidance - not serving the public.\n\n\n\nI can tell the delegates of this conference now - we are not here to deal with people of principle, we are not here to deal with people of honour and we are certainly not here to deal with people worthy of trust. We are here to deal with Labour - and deal with them we will.\n\n\n\nWhere hospitals face hundreds of targets - we will cut them\n\nWhere Ministers now interfere and try to mirco-manage- we will put a stop to that\n\nWhere money fails to reach frontline services, the Conservatives will deliver.\n\n\n\nein dydd yn dod - our day is coming.\"\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t Send to a friend \t Print\tAbout Jonathan Morgan AM >>\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t RELATED NEWS\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFuel prices threaten rural Wales\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\tLabour must ease pain for Welsh households\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\tWiggin keeps shadow Welsh Secretary post\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\tThree Rs plan to tackle binge drinking in Wales\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\tBuilding on success in Wales\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n    \t\n\t\t\n    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t \tAlso in the news \n\t \tNewsroom\n\t \tNews headlines\n\t \tSpeeches\n\t \tMultimedia\n\t \tBlogs\n\t \tRecent press releases\n\t \tArticles\n\t \tLocal Govt.

Metformin\npatients primarily randomised to intensive therapy with sulphonylurea were not given additional metformin until their fpg was >15 mmol/L or they developed hyperglycaemic symptoms\nin view of the progressive hyperglycaemia in these patients, a protocol modification was made to secondarily randomise the subset of patients who were on maximum sulphonylurea therapy and had fpg >6 mmol/L to earlier addition of metformin\nAim\nthe aim of this secondary randomisation was to assess the degree to which glycaemic control might be improved by early combination therapy with metformin\n\nin view of the interesting results in the primary metformin study a secondary analysis was undertaken to examine any endpoints that had occurred\nAggregate Endpoints\n*\n* interpret with caution in view of

therapy?\ncurrent guidelines suggest HbA1c <7%\nthe risk of diabetic complications was reduced in the UKPDS trial which achieved a median HbA1c 7.0% in the intensive glucose control group\nthis HbA1c level is in accord with current guidelines but is difficult to accomplish in some patients\nepidemiological analysis suggests that any reduction of hyperglycaemia would be advantageous\n\nWhich goals of therapy?\ncurrent guidelines suggest blood pressure <140 / 85 mmHg or <130 / 85 mmHg\nthe risk of diabetic complications was reduced in the UKPDS blood pressure control trial which achieved a mean blood pressure 144 / 82 mmHg in the tight control group\nthis result is in accord with current guidelines, which are also supported by the epidemiological analysis\nPolypharmacy\nglycaemia\ncombinations of agents with different actions will be needed\nmore patients will require insulin\n\nblood pressure\nmany patients will need 3 or more different types of agents\nDifferences between Therapies\nsulphonylurea, insulin and metformin are each effective in reducing the risk of any diabetes related endpoints and microvascular endpoints\n\nno evidence of increased risk of complications for any single therapy\n\nACE inhibitors and Beta blockers are each effective in reducing the risk of macrovascular and microvascular endpoints \n\nno evidence that either is specifically advantageous\nUK Prospective Diabetes Study\nThe UKPDS has shown conclusively that : \nintensive therapy to reduce glycaemia is worthwhile as it reduces risk of complications\n\ntight blood pressure control is worthwhile as it reduces risk of complications\n\nthere are no major differences between the therapies tested\n\nreduction in risk of complications of diabetes  is a realisable goal\nBeneficial Effects of Intensive Therapy\nThe UKPDS has shown that\nmore intensive monitoring\nmore intensive use of existing therapies\nwhich improves\nblood glucose

          "Diabetes Medicines -- familydoctor.org\n\nReturn to Web version\n\n\n\t\n\nDiabetes Medicines\n\n\nWhat is type 2 diabetes? \nDiabetes is a disease that occurs when your body doesn’t make enough of a hormone called insulin, or when your body can’t use insulin the right way. Insulin helps balance the level of glucose (sugar) in your blood. The blood sugar level is too high in people with diabetes. Children usually get type 1 diabetes, which means their body doesn’t make insulin at all. Adults usually get type 2 diabetes, which means their body makes insulin, but it doesn’t make enough or they can’t use it properly.\n\nHow is diabetes treated? \nThe goal of diabetes treatment is to keep your blood sugar level as close to normal as possible. The first step is to have a healthy diet and to exercise. This may mean you’ll need to change your diet and exercise habits. You’ll also have to watch your weight, or even lose weight, to keep your blood sugar level as normal as possible. Your doctor will talk to you about the kinds of food you should eat and how much exercise you’ll need every week.\n\n\nSometimes diet and exercise alone can’t keep your blood sugar levels normal. Then your doctor will talk to you about other treatments, such as medicine or insulin shots.\n\n\nMany people with diabetes find it fairly easy to keep track of their own blood sugar level at home. Your doctor can use the results to see how your treatment is working.\n\nAre there medicines I can take?\nSeveral kinds of medicine can help you control your blood sugar level. Some medicines are pills that you take by mouth (orally). Oral medicine doesn’t work for everyone, though. Some people need to take insulin. If you need insulin, you’ll have to give yourself a shot. Most people with type 2 diabetes start with an oral medicine. Your doctor will tell you which kind of medicine you should take and why.\nWhat is combination therapy?\nCombination therapy uses 2 medicines to help you control your blood sugar level. It can also help with other health problems (such as having high blood pressure or high cholesterol levels, or being overweight). Each medicine works in a slightly different way. This therapy can combine 2 oral medicines, or 1 oral medicine plus insulin.\nWhat medicines could my doctor prescribe?\nSix kinds of diabetes medicine are available in pill form: sulfonylureas, metformin, thiazolidinediones, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, repaglinide and nateglinide. Each medicine has good points and bad points. Your doctor will decide which medicine is right for you.\n\n\nSulfonylureas\n\nSulfonylureas (some brand names: Glucotrol, Micronase) are the most commonly prescribed diabetes medicines. They are inexpensive and have few side effects. These medicines help your body make insulin. They can be taken alone or with metformin, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, pioglitazone or insulin. If you’re allergic to sulfa, you can’t take a sulfonylurea.\n\n\nMetformin\n\nMetformin (brand name: Glucophage) may be prescribed for people with diabetes who are overweight, because it may help with weight problems. It helps the body use insulin better. Metformin can cause problems like nausea or diarrhea in some people. It can be taken with a sulfonylurea.\n\n\nThiazolidinediones\n\nThis class of medicines includes rosiglitazone (brand name: Avandia) and pioglitazone (brand name: Actos). An older medicine, troglitazone (brand name: Rezulin) is no longer being made because of the risk of liver problems. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone appear less likely to cause liver problems, but people taking them need periodic liver tests. These medicines help your body respond better to insulin. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone can be used alone or in combination with other diabetes medicines.\n\n\nAlpha-glucosidase inhibitors\n\nAlpha-glucosidase inhibitors (brand names: Precose, Glyset) work in your stomach and bowels to slow down the absorption of sugar. If another medicine doesn’t control your blood sugar, you might use this kind. This medicine can cause stomach or bowel problems, so it may not be a good choice if you have a history of stomach or bowel trouble. It can be taken alone or with a sulfonylurea.\n\n\nRepaglinide\n\nRepaglinide (brand name: Prandin) is taken with meals to control your blood sugar. Your doctor can tell you how to adjust the dose according to the number of meals you eat. Repaglinide can be taken alone or with metformin.\n\n\nNateglinide\n\nNateglinide (brand name: Starlix) is taken with meals to keep your blood sugar level from getting too high after you eat. Nateglinide can be taken alone or with metformin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Organizations\n\nAmerican Diabetes Association\n\nhttp://www.diabetes.org\n\n(800) 342-2383\n\n\nSource\n\n\nTreatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (American Family Physician May 15, 1999, http://www.aafp.org/afp/990515ap/2835.html)\n\n\nReviewed/Updated: 6/02\nCreated: 5/99\n\nThis handout provides a general overview on this topic and may not apply to everyone.

In his work Eastward to Tartary, the former describes his visit to the headquarters of the Virtue Party, the forerunner of the party that has now won the elections, and reports his interviews with militants and leaders of the party and says that he is convinced of the modernising vocation of this political force in both the economic and political fields. However, Kaplan contemplates the rise of this party in the Turkish political scene with ambivalence, as this modernising spirit does not necessarily correspond to a pro-western leaning. In the new Turkey founded by Ataturk, westernisation has been interpreted as secularisation and not always as democratisation. The moderate Islamists have, on the other hand, staked on the second of these and achieved a clear popular mandate in the polls, but the secular forces, beginning with the military, mistrust the intentions of their leader Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThis currently gives special interest to the work of professor Metin Heper, which analyses the ideological evolution of Erdogan from his religious training and his political career alongside the Islamist leader Necmettin Erbakan, to his current break with him. Heper particularly stresses the influence on the young Erdogan of the director of the religious school he attended, Sheik Kotku of the Nakshibandi order. Kotku considered moral development as a pre-requisite both of material development and political stability. Although this moral impulse would have to come from the interiorisation of the virtues of Islam, its final objective would be aimed at the influence on the mundane sphere. Heper highlights the “extraordinary sensitivity towards modernity” of Kotku and says that the revitalising role that he attributes to Islam is comparable to the protestant ethics in Max Weber’s analysis. From these ideas, Erdogan’s project is progressively defined until it achieves the following traits:\n\n\n \n·         A moralisation of political life that serves to overcome the crisis of legitimacy of the Turkish political class and relaunch a strong economy on solid bases.\n             ·         This moral rearming is preached by example. The reference to Islam comes in a personal plain and does not involve a change in the nature of the State or the imposal upon the secularists of an Islamic lifestyle.\n            ·         Although there is no intention to alter the State created by Ataturk, from the point of view of identity, the emphasis is placed on the values of civilisation and History associated with Turkey’s Islamic cultural roots. \n           ·         Although democracy is conceived more as a means than an end, in recent years Erdogan has preferred to stress his unequivocal commitment to democracy, as this is the only conceivable system possible for developing his political project.\n           ·         In the same way, the initial reticence towards adhesion to the EU has changed into the conviction that Europe represents a space of democracy and that the EU therefore constitutes a “legal umbrella” that will prevent the military from preventing this political alternative.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe conclusion is that the route taken by Erdogan gives credibility to his project to marry Islam with democracy in Turkey. However, tolerance must play in both directions: the Islamists may not undermine the foundations of the secular State, nor may the secularists impose their way of life on the faithful. The problem is that the mistrust of the secularists is deep-rooted, and for them Erdogan uses the well-known Islamic practice of disguise (takiyye), so the true intentions are hidden until the time comes to reveal them.\n\nIf Erdogan demonstrates his loyalty to the secular State with facts, the greatest danger of a democratic bankruptcy would not come from the failure of the radical secularists to recognise that the journey to the centre by the Justice and Development Party has been consummated.\n\nWill this internal conflict prevent the success of the current Turkish political experiment? Will the military frustrate the attempt just like they did with the Erbakan government? Robert Kaplan believes that agreement is possible between the Islamists and the military, the only two forces with popular deep-rootedness and prestige in the country. On the other hand, the Bush administration seems to stake on the success of this new political phase; in the short term, Turkish co-operation is fundamental for any war scenario in Iraq. However, in general terms, the strategic role of Turkey, which was essential for the Atlantic Alliance during the Cold War, is still essential today in the war against terrorism. Its geographical and military value is complemented by a political factor of enormous significance: the possibility of creating a model that conjugates Islam and democracy as an example to the rest of the Islamic world. This is the reason for the United States pressure on the EU for the European Council in Copenhagen to give Turkey a positive signal to start negotiations for entry. These dealings seem to have borne fruit in the case of Germany, as Chancellor Schroeder must pay a large price to rebuild his relations with Washington following an electoral campaign with an anti-US tone.\n\nIt is in this context that we receive Giscard d’Estaign’s declarations to Le Monde. The President of the European Convention makes them only a few days after his visit to the Vatican, from whence he returned with the petition from the Pope for the new European Constitution to include a reference to Europe’s Christian roots. The link between both questions is not a casual one and indicates a cultural definition of the frontiers of Europe.\n\nGiscard affirms that Turkey is an important country but not European, thus placing himself fully in the analysis of Huntington in Clash of civilisations. In this work, he argues that Turkey is one of these broken away countries like Mexico and Russia, which lie between two civilisations. But three conditions must hold for a broken away country to successfully redefine its identity. In the first place, the elite in the country must be in favour of such a step. In the second place, society must at least be willing to accept the change of identity, and thirdly, the dominant centres of the host civilisation must be willing to accept the convert. Huntington considers that even though the first two requirements might be given, the third does not hold in the case of Europe. He therefore proposes that Turkey should give up its humiliating role as an eternal candidate asking for entry into Europe and should return to its more worthy, relevant role as a central State of the Islamic world, which the Ottoman Empire played in the past for eight hundred and fifty years. This would be a historical option for Turkey, but the consequences of this must be considered when it is not a voluntary move, but rather the result of the rejection of Europe.\n\nGiscard’s declarations refer not only to Huntington but also to De Gaulle when he says that those who have most encouraged the expansion in the direction of Turkey have been the adversaries of the EU. This is the reason for the echo that his statements have received among other French personalities in different parties, such as Hubert Vedrine. Giscard points to the USA and the United Kingdom and says that Turkey would be a Trojan horse that would end up breaking up the European project, thus finishing with all attempts to create a superpower capable of facing up to the strength of the United States.\n\nThere is another reason that Giscard does not state clearly, but which underlies his view, which is referred to by Huntington when he quotes the British analyst Barry Buzan: “a society cold war with Islam would serve to strengthen European identity at a crucial time for the process of integration”. Islamophobia in Europe has recently become a powerful wave of opinion that entered the last French presidential elections and the Dutch and Danish parliamentary elections with more force than ever. The Turkish candidature is therefore a popular cause among the member States and their governments know this. However, for the moment they have been able to swim and save their clothes. But the European Council in Copenhagen must come out with an unequivocal message in one way or the other. The open debate on the membership of Turkey in the EU is now inevitable.\n\nThe immediate question on the table is that of Cyprus, its adhesion to the EU as a single State with the blessing of Turkey or as a divided country, which would open a serious crisis with Ankara. Beyond Cyprus there is the strategic stake that Europe wants to make in favour of the success of the political phase starting in Turkey, which will have consequences on our relations with the Islamic world, undoubtedly the most decisive question in the new international situation that has opened up following the attacks of 11th September. Will these considerations weigh more heavily on the European leaders, or will they feel under pressure by the foreseeable difficulties of the EU being able to digest a country that would have the largest population of any in Europe? It is, in any case, a transcendental decision that places the EU now, more than at any time in the past, before its responsibilities as the strong international actor it wishes to be.\n\n\nFidel Sendagorta\n\nDirector of the Cabinet for the Analysis and Prevision of Foreign Policy of the Spanish Foreign Affairs Ministry\n\n\n\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t \n\t\n\t \n\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t© Fundación Real Instituto Elcano, Madrid, 2004.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDesarrollado por: KnowHowNet\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t \n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   ",

However, as he had said this morning, the main issue was not about personality but about the structural weaknesses with the rail industry. That weakness was currently being addressed by the Government through investment, through the new strategic vision of the SRA which was due to be published next week, by addressing the false incentives which had arisen as a result of the botched privatisation process, and above all by getting new management into Railtrack and finding a new future for the company. Asked the last time the Prime Minister had publicly expressed support for Mr Byers, the PMOS said the Prime Minister had consistently made clear his support for the Transport Secretary. He did not go around commenting on the performance of every Secretary of State. The Prime Minister preferred to focus on the real issues rather than personalities because that was what mattered in the end. Asked if he was implying that Stephen Byers did not necessarily have to be Transport Secretary if it was just about doing the job rather than personalities, the PMOS said that the Prime Minister's position on Mr Byers had not changed one iota. He still retained the Prime Minister's full confidence. It was all about focussing on the fundamental reasons as to why we were where we were, namely the lack of investment, structural weaknesses and the failings of Railtrack. Asked if Mr Byers was the right person to address those issues, the PMOS said yes.\n\nAsked why it had taken a year to put Railtrack into administration given, as the Prime Minister had said in PMQs, that the decision the company could not continue as it was had been taken after Hatfield, the PMOS said that Railtrack had made promises about how it would improve its performance. Unfortunately those promises had not been fulfilled. It was now becoming apparent that the company did not have a clear idea of the condition of the track, its finances or its assets.\n\nPM VISITS\n\nAsked whether a date had been set for the Prime Minister's trip to Africa, the PMOS said that as he had said this morning, the Prime Minister's interest in Africa remained unchanged. However, we never commented on his travel arrangements in advance. Referring to recent stories in the Express, the PMOS added that he failed to understand how anyone could say that the Prime Minister should not be involved in foreign affairs. The West's neglect of Afghanistan and its habit of turning a blind eye to international issues had contributed to the events of September 11. As the Prime Minister had said in Bangalore, the impact had been felt by people here just as much as anywhere else. The aerospace industry, for example, was a global industry and had been badly affected by September 11. Put to him by the Express correspondent that the paper had only suggested the Prime Minister should get the balance between the domestic and foreign agenda right and whether he would accept that the Prime Minister had looked tired today, the PMOS said that the Prime Minister had been on top of every issue both when he had been away and since his return. The suggestion that he should not go abroad was unrealistic. Travelling overseas was how Prime Ministers and Presidents met their foreign counterparts. Questioned as to whether the Prime Minister had spent Tuesday afternoon being brought up to speed on domestic issues such as health and transport, the PMOS repeated that the Prime Minister had kept in touch with the domestic agenda while he had been abroad. He had spent yesterday afternoon in meetings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Links\n \n Email the Prime Minister\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSend an email to Prime Minister Tony Blair\n\t\t\t\t\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrime Minister's Questions\nWatch Prime Minister's Questions live here every Wednesday Parliament is in session\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tFrequently Asked Questions\nAnswers to our most frequently asked questions\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLearn about the Cabinet\nLearn more about the Ministers who make up the Cabinet and its famous history\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUseful Links\nUseful links to other government sites\n\n \n\n\n\n\n|\n\t\t\tcopyright | contact the webteam | website feedback | privacy policy | advanced search | sitemap | accessibility | rss feed | \n\n\n\n\n",

The 'war on terror' and the war in Iraq has not only led to a new wave of human rights abuses but also diverted attention from old ones which continue hidden from the eyes of the world.\n\n\t\n\tLaunching the Amnesty International Annual Report 2004, the organisation said that violence by armed groups and increasing violations by governments have combined to produce the most sustained attack on human rights and international humanitarian law in 50 years. This is leading to a world of growing mistrust, fear and division.\n\nAmnesty International Secretary General Irene Khan said:\n\n\"Callous, cruel and criminal attacks by armed groups such as al-Qa’ida, pose a very real threat to the security of people everywhere. We condemn them in the strongest possible terms as serious crimes under international and domestic law, sometimes amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity,\" \n\nAmnesty International strongly condemned armed groups responsible for atrocities such as the March 11 bombing in Madrid and the bomb attack on the United Nations building in Iraq on 19 August 2003, which killed UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Sergio Vieira de Mello.\n\nThe human rights organisation said that violent attacks on civilians and on institutions established to provide solutions to conflict and insecurity, such as the United Nations and International Committee of the Red Cross, represented a significant new threat to international justice.\n\n“But it is also frightening that the principles of international law and the tools of multilateral action which could protect us from these attacks are being undermined, marginalised or destroyed by powerful governments,” continued Irene Khan. \n\n“Governments are losing their moral compass, sacrificing the global values of human rights in a blind pursuit of security. This failure of leadership is a dangerous concession to armed groups.\n\n“The global security agenda promoted by the US Administration is bankrupt of vision and bereft of principle. Violating rights at home, turning a blind eye to abuses abroad and using pre-emptive military force where and when it chooses has damaged justice and freedom, and made the world a more dangerous place.”  \n\nReports of torture and ill-treatment underline the vulnerability of hundreds of prisoners, not only in Iraq but also at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba, Afghanistan and elsewhere, incarcerated by the United States and its allies without charge, trial, access to lawyers or protection of the Geneva Conventions.\n\n“By failing to protect the rights of those who may be guilty, governments endanger the rights of those who are innocent, and put us all at risk.”  \n\nAmnesty International’s Annual Report 2004 documents festering conflicts in places like Chechnya, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, and Nepal which have become a breeding ground for some of the worst atrocities. Violence in Israel and the Occupied Territories has deepened, while elsewhere many governments are openly pursuing repressive agendas.\n\n“While governments have been obsessed with Iraq, they have allowed the real weapons of mass destruction - injustice and impunity, poverty, discrimination and racism, the uncontrolled trade in small arms, violence against women and abuse of children - to go unaddressed,” said Irene Khan.\n\nWhile underlining abuse and impunity, hypocrisy and double standards of governments, Amnesty International highlighted the emerging power of civil society to turn the tide in favour of human rights.\n\nGlobally, despite the efforts by the United States to undermine international justice and ensure global immunity for its citizens, the International Criminal Court appointed its prosecutor and began its work in earnest. Slowly the courts in the United States and the United Kingdom have begun to scrutinise the executive power to restrict human rights.\n\n“Human rights matter because they offer a powerful and compelling vision of a better and fairer world, and a concrete plan of how to get there. These global values of justice are the most effective route to security and peace,” concluded Irene Khan.\n\nBackground\n\nThe 339-page report documents human rights issues of concern to Amnesty International during 2003 in 155 countries. It reports that:\n\n\tExtrajudicial executions were carried out in 47 countries;\n\tPeople were \"disappeared\" by state agents in 28 countries;\n\tVictims of torture and ill-treatment by security forces, police and other state authorities were reported in 132 countries;\n\tPrisoners of conscience were held in 44 countries;\n\tPeople were arbitrarily arrested and detained without charge or trial in 58 countries;\n\tPeople were sentenced to death in 63 countries;\n\tPeople were executed in 28 countries;\n\tArmed opposition groups committed serious human rights violations, such as deliberate and arbitrary killings of civilians, torture and abductions or hostage taking in 35 countries;\n\tArmed groups have committed violent acts and killings in 34 countries;\n\tArmed groups have committed torture and ill-treatment in 18 countries;\n\tArmed groups have committed hostage takings and abductions in 16 countries.\n\n\nRead the Report ...\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n    \n    site help\n    contact aiuk\n    members' area\n    ai worldwide\n    amnesty works\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n\nhomemedia centre...take action...about ai...join ai...how to give...education...library...about this site...members...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        main stories\n    \n        news by date\n    \n        media awards\n    \n        letters to the press\n    \n        comment articles\n    \n        diary notices\n    \n        news mailing list\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        current actions\n    \n        ongoing campaigns\n    \n        get active\n    \n        urgent action\n    \n        special interest networks\n    \n        local groups\n    \n        youth & student groups\n    \n        trade unions\n    \n        worldwide appeals\n    \n        political lobbying\n    \n        events\n    \n        ai works\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        contact aiuk\n    \n        what ai does\n    \n        ai works\n    \n        ai history\n    \n        ai faq\n    \n        about aiuk\n    \n        aiuk policy\n    \n        aiuk n ireland\n    \n        aiuk scotland\n    \n        aiuk wales\n    \n        aiuk links\n    \n        aiuk jobs\n    \n        contact ai worldwide\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        join now\n    \n        why join?\n    \n        work for ai\n    \n        volunteer for ai\n    \n        individual campaigners\n    \n        local groups\n    \n        youth & student groups\n    \n        urgent action\n    \n        join a network\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        join\n    \n        donate\n    \n        give as you spend\n    \n        buy something\n    \n        fundraise\n    \n        aiuk & money\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        youth groups\n    \n        student groups\n    \n        teaching resources\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        campaigns\n    \n        annual rpts\n    \n        by country\n    \n        by theme\n    \n        books\n    \n        educational\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        welcome\n    \n        local action\n    \n        individual campaigners\n    \n        local groups\n    \n        networks\n    \n        trainers\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n",

We hear from detractors complaining about the fact of an inquiry and purporting to fume about the costs. Yet many of these same people persisted in peddling the Widgery version as the absolute verdict on Bloody Sunday and its victims. It is precisely because the murder of that day was compounded by the lies on stilts from Widgery on that the necessary truth-finding process is inevitably elaborate.\n\n \n\nThose denouncing the scale and costs of the Inquiry include those who have been the cheerleaders for the series of legal challenges aimed at stunting its progress and blunting its effectiveness – and all adding to the costs and time involved.\n\n \n\nAll of these things add to the burden on the families, as has the relocation of the Inquiry to London, with all the strains of displacement that brings for them. The cast of witnesses in London makes this a key phase of the Inquiry. The fact that it is such an important part of the journey doesn’t make it any more comfortable for the relatives of the dead victims or for the injured attending the Inquiry. It is important that witnesses in London are seen to be treated by the tribunal with the degree of pursuit and balance of protection equal to that afforded to witnesses in the Guildhall.\n\n \n\nOur focus today on the need for truth for the victims of Bloody Sunday does not and must not mean that we are blind to the needs of others for truth also. These include other victims of state agents and they also include the victims of other forces and self-styled armies too. The denial of truth to different victims is expressed or unexpressed in different ways. Others might not have had their innocence grossly impugned, but their loved ones feel a sense of violation at the portrayal of their loss as a consequence of legitimate conduct by others.\n\n \n\nI have talked with many victims and victims’ groups. I have listened to them. Whether they were bereaved or injured in a multiple atrocity or an isolated attack, there is an underlying common need for recognition by truth and a vindication of memory. They are worried that a process which talks in smug-sounding ways of “drawing lines” and “moving on” is striking out their memory and leaving them behind in forgotten-hood.\n\n \n\nJust as we owe it to the families we are with today to insist that their very particular need for truth and vindication is delivered in a manner commensurate with the violation suffered, so too do we owe it to others to devise spaces and shapes for the truth that they need to have seen and heard.\n\n \n\nThose who had their lives taken on Bloody Sunday were marching for civil rights. They sought a civil order marked by justice and equality. As a non-violent movement, the Civil Rights Association sought a society that was fully equal and truly peaceful. This generation has the opportunity not just to stand for that vision but to step forward to those values as living out-workings of political progress.\n\n \n\nWe have already negotiated an agreement mandated by the Irish people, North and South. We now need to negotiate its complete implementation. A compact for completion could provide collective certainty about the full delivery and development of the Agreement, instead of the collective ambiguity which has made the implementation of some parts hostages of the interpretation of other parts.\n\n \n\nParties who have made different but decisive contributions in the life of this whole process and the Agreement owe it to themselves to move forward on a basis of collective certainty. In spite of all that has happened or hasn’t happened, they owe it to each other and they certainly owe it to the people.\n\n \n\nIn this context, we can and have to properly fulfil the Agreement’s promise to victims. We must not only secure a verbal basis for people of different political persuasions to have confidence that they and future generations can live and work together in peace. We also have to provide a moral basis for giving those who have lost loved ones at the hands of different political forces over the past generation the comfort that they can, with truth, rest in peace.\n\n \n\nENDS 02/02/03\n\n \n\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It defines a systematic disposition of certain trial designs to produce results consistently better or worse than other trial designs. \n\n\n\t\tBias is an asystematic error or deviation in results or inferences. In studies of the effects of healthcare bias can arise from systematic differences in the groups that are compared (selection bias), the care that is provided, or exposure to other factors apart from the intervention of interest (performance bias), withdrawals or exclusions of people entered into the study (attrition bias) or how outcomes are assessed (detection bias).  Bias does not necessarily carry an imputation of prejudice, such as the investigators' desire for particular results.  This differs from conventional use of the word in which bias refers to a partisan point of view.  \n\n\n\t\tBias in clinical trials has many different origins, and is dealt with in a longer essay or    PDF.  \n\n\n\n Bias also occurs in diagnostic tests.\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\t\t\n\t\tdonate to Bandolier! \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tKnowledge Library\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\tHealthy Living Zone\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\tExtended Essays\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\tLearning Zone\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\tEBM Glossary\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t      \n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t advanced search \n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t| Home | Bandolier Journal | Bandolier Knowledge | Bandolier Extra | Glossary |\n\n\t| Contact Us | About Bandolier | ? copyright 1994 - 2005 |\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n  ",

Charges shall be leviable on pigs slaughtered in a slaughterhouse and shall be recoverable by the Commission from the slaughterer having the control and management of the slaughterhouse where the pigs are slaughtered.\n\n\n    (2) The maximum charge in respect of each pig for which charges are leviable under this levy scheme shall not exceed £1. Subject to sub-paragraphs (1) and (4), the Commission may, after consultation with BPEX, levy such amounts as it thinks fit from time to time or suspend the levy for any period.\n\n\n    (3) Without prejudice to the generality of sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph (but subject to sub-paragraphs (1) and (4)), the Commission may impose charges of different amounts according to the weight, quality or value of the pigs in respect of which the charges are imposed;\n\n\nprovided that no charges shall be levied under this levy scheme in respect of livestock slaughtered under the Animal Health Act 1981.\n\n\n    (4) The Commission shall not levy any charge under this levy scheme in respect of any pig which they are satisfied was not born or reared or fattened in Great Britain. For this purpose, the Commission shall be satisfied if the slaughterer is so satisfied, on the basis of such evidence as the Commission shall determine.\n\n\n    \n\n2.\n - (1) Any charge duly levied under this levy scheme shall, subject as mentioned in sub-paragraph (3), be payable to the Commission on such date or dates and at such place or places as the Commission may from time to time require and shall be recoverable as a debt due to the Commission from the slaughterer.\n\n\n    (2) (a) Subject to sub-paragraph (b) - \n\n\n\n\n\n(i) where the slaughterer slaughters a pig which he has purchased, or of which he has agreed to purchase all or part of the carcase after slaughter, the Commission may determine that there shall be recoverable as a debt due to him from the person from whom he has purchased the pig or has agreed to purchase all or part of the carcase (as the case may be) the whole of any sum paid by the slaughterer under this levy scheme in respect of that pig;\n\n\n\nprovided that where the purchase was at auction the slaughterer is hereby authorised to recover from the auctioneer instead of from the person from whom he purchased;\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) where the slaughterer slaughters a pig (not being a pig which the slaughterer has purchased or of which he has agreed to purchase all or part of the carcase after slaughter) on the instructions of another person, the Commission may determine that there shall be recoverable on demand as a debt due to him from that person the whole of any sum paid by the said slaughterer under this levy scheme by reference to that pig;\n\n\n(iii) where an auctioneer auctions a pig which is then slaughtered by any purchaser who is entitled to claim from the auctioneer any sum paid under the levy scheme, the Commission may determine that any such sum which is claimed by the purchaser from the auctioneer shall be recoverable on demand as a debt due to the auctioneer from the person for whom he auctioned the pig.\n\n\n\n(b) Sub-paragraph (a) shall apply only where the person from whom the slaughterer is authorised to recover is a person engaged in the production, marketing (including marketing by a person concerned otherwise than as a buyer or seller), or distribution of pigs or pig products.\n\n\n\n\n    (3) The Commission may in its absolute discretion determine that the slaughterer shall be entitled to make deductions from his payments to the Commission in respect of his expenses in exercising his right of recovery under sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph or in ascertaining whether a charge is leviable under this levy scheme in respect of any pig slaughtered by him, but such deduction shall not exceed such amount as the Commission may from time to time determine as being reasonable.\n\n\n    (4) Where the slaughterer defaults in payment to the Commission of any sum due from him under this levy scheme and would, if he had made payment, have been authorised to recover such sum from another person in accordance with sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph, the Commission are authorised, if they think fit, to recover directly from the last-mentioned person as a debt due from him to the Commission the amount which would have been payable indirectly if the default had not occurred;\n\n\nprovided that this sub-paragraph shall not apply where the last-mentioned person satisfies the Commission that he has made payment to the slaughterer.\n\n\n    (5) Where in the opinion of the Commission any sum which a slaughterer is authorised by sub-paragraph (2) to recover from another person ought reasonably to be treated as irrecoverable by the slaughterer, the Commission shall afford him relief either by permitting him to deduct such sum from payments to the Commission or by way of refund whichever the Commission shall decide.\n\n\n    (6) Where a slaughterer has not made payment of a charge due to the Commission under this levy scheme within 21 days of a written request for the charge concerned being made, then, in order to enable the Commission to meet their expenses of administering the Scheme, interest will become payable (after as well as before judgment) on the amount of the unpaid charge from the date of the written request and will be charged at the rate of one per cent above the London Interbank Offer Rate offered for a three month deposit in Sterling and will accrue daily until the charge is paid.\n\n\n    (7) Any sum recovered as a debt by a slaughterer pursuant to paragraph 2(2)(a) shall be deemed to be received by him in trust for the Commission.\n\n\n    \n\n3.\n - (1) So far as necessary for determining the liability of slaughterers to charges under this levy scheme, the Commission may, by notice published in at least one newspaper having a national circulation in England and Wales and at least one newspaper having a national circulation in Scotland and in such other newspapers and other periodicals as the Commission consider appropriate to bring the matter to the notice of persons affected, from time to time require every slaughterer (or any class or classes of slaughterers specified in the notice) to be registered in a register kept for the purpose by the Commission.\n\n\n    (2) Without prejudice to the preceding sub-paragraph, the Commission may (so far as is necessary for the purpose mentioned in that sub-paragraph) by notice in writing served upon any slaughterer require him to be registered as aforesaid.\n\n\n    (3) Any slaughterer who is required to be registered as aforesaid shall apply to the Commission to be registered upon such form as the Commission may from time to time prescribe; and any person so registered who has ceased to be a slaughterer and who desires that his name shall be removed from the register shall apply for such removal upon such form as the Commission may from time to time prescribe.\n\n\n    \n\n4.\nSo far as is necessary for determining the liability of any slaughterer to charges under this levy scheme, the Commission may from time to time by notice in writing served upon any slaughterer require him - \n\n\n\n\n\n(a) to keep an accurate record in writing, to be duly completed and signed and dated each day, specifying - \n\n\n\n\n(i) for each pig slaughtered on the instructions of another person, the name and sufficient other information to identify that person and a sufficient description of the animal to enable the charge payable in respect of it to be ascertained;\n\n\n(ii) the total number of pigs slaughtered each day and sufficient information to enable the charges payable in respect thereof to be ascertained;\n\n\n\n(b) to retain any such record for such period (not exceeding two years) as may be specified in the notice;\n\n\n(c) to produce for examination on demand by a person authorised for that purpose by the Commission any such record and any other books or documents in the possession or under the control of the slaughterer; and\n\n\n(d) to furnish to the Commission at such address and at such time or times and in such form as may be specified in the notice such returns and other information as may be so specified.\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n5.\nA person authorised to act in the exercise of the power conferred by paragraph 4(c) shall carry a warrant of his authority so to act and shall produce the same on demand.\n\n\n    \n\n6.\nFor the purpose of establishing the liability of any person under this levy scheme, the production of a certificate purporting to be signed by the Director General or other officer of the Commission authorised to give the certificate specifying the amounts levied by the Commission for any period shall be sufficient evidence of the facts so specified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATORY NOTE\n\n\n\n(This note is not part of the Order)\n\n\nBy this Order the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the National Assembly for Wales, acting jointly, and with the consent of the Scottish Ministers, confirm the Pig Industry Development Scheme (2000) (\"the Development Scheme\").\n\n\nThe Development Scheme, which applies to Great Britain and is made by the Meat and Livestock Commission (\"the Commission\") under section 9 of the Agriculture Act 1967 (c. 22) (\"the Act\") has as its objective the provision of such facilities or services, and the giving of such financial assistance, as the Commission shall determine for the purpose of the better organisation and development of the pig industry in dealing with the risk of pig herds contracting an infectious disease and the financial consequences for the businesses of pig producers, in so far as incurred in Great Britain, of any such disease. For this purpose, the Commission are given the functions set out in Schedule 1 to the Development Scheme.\n\n\nParagraph 13 of the Development Scheme provides for the Commission to establish a fund for the operation of the Development Scheme, and Schedule 2 to the Development Scheme provides for contributions to that fund to be made from charges levied on slaughterers of pigs which are slaughtered in a slaughter house. The maximum charge per pig is specified as £1. Provision is made for the Commission to determine that such charges shall be recoverable from the person from whom the slaughterer has purchased the pig or on whose instructions the pig has been slaughtered, and, where such charges are recoverable from an auctioneer, for the charges to be recoverable by the auctoneer in turn from the person for whom he auctioned the pig.\n\n\nThe Development Scheme enables the Commission to require slaughterers to be registered in a register kept by the Commission, and to keep accurate records relating to pigs slaughtered.\n\n\nThe Development Scheme applies the offences in section 14(2) and (3) in relation to the levy scheme set out in Schedule 2, and also applies for the purposes of that levy scheme the powers of entry conferred by section 23 of the Act and the restrictions on disclosure of information in section 24 of the Act.\n\n\nA Regulatory Impact Assessment has been prepared in respect of this Order and has been deposited in the library of both Houses of Parliament.\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n[1] \nc. 22.back\n\n[2] \nThe functions of \"the Ministers\" (as defined by section 25(1) of the Agriculture Act 1967) conferred by paragraph 5(1) of Schedule 2 to the Act, in so far as exercisable in relation to Wales, are by virtue of the National Assembly for Wales (Transfer of Functions) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999/672) exercisable by the National Assembly for Wales jointly with the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The Secretary of State for Scotland's share in the joint function ceased by virtue of article 3 of and Schedule 16, paragraph 3(2), to the Scotland Act 1998 (Cross-Border Public Authorities) (Adaptation of Functions etc.) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999/1747), and did not transer to the Scottish Ministers: section 88(1) of the Scotland Act 1998 (c. 46).back\n\n\n[3] \nThe consent of the Scottish Ministers is required by virtue of article 3 of and Schedule 16, paragraph 3(3), to the Scotland Act 1998 (Cross-Border Public Authorities) (Adaptation of Functions etc.) Order 1999.back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nISBN \n0 11 028983 8\n\n\n\n\n\t \n\n\n\t\n\nOther UK SIs | Home | National Assembly for Wales Statutory Instruments | Scottish Statutory Instruments | Statutory Rules of Northern Ireland | \nHer Majesty's Stationery Office\n\t\n\n\t\nWe welcome your comments on this site\n\t© Crown copyright 2001\tPrepared \n21 March 2001\n\n\n\n\n",

This includes temperature, wind and rainfall patterns.\n                  The climate of the Earth is not static, and has changed many\n                  times in response to a variety of natural causes. \n\n                The main human influence on global climate is likely to be\n                  emissions of greenhouse\n                  gases such as carbon dioxide\n                  (CO2) and methane. At present, about 6.5 billion tonnes of\n                  CO2 is emitted globally\n                  each year, mostly through burning coal, oil and gas for energy.   \n\n                Climate change is already happening. Globally, the ten hottest\n                  years on record have all occurred since the beginning of the\n                  1990s. Current climate models predict that global temperatures\n                  could warm from between 1.4 to 5.8oC over the next\n                  100 years, depending on the amounts of greenhouse gases emitted\n                  and the sensitivity of the climate system.  \n\n                What climate change means for us\n\n                For the UK, climate change means warmer temperatures, wetter\n                  winters and drier summers, less snow, and higher sea levels,\n                  leading to flooding of coastal areas.  \n\n                Across the globe, there may be severe problems for regions\n                  where people are particularly vulnerable to changes in the\n                  weather. Flooding, droughts, food shortages and the spread\n                  of disease are commonly predicted. The social, environmental\n                  and economic costs of climate change could be huge.  \n\n                Opportunities\n\n                Climate change presents a significant challenge to the UK\n                  and to the international community.  There are also enormous\n                  opportunities if we are willing to take action. Government,\n                  business and individuals all have a part to play, and all of\n                  us can benefit from rising to the challenge of climate change.\n\n                Further information:\n\n                \tThe greenhouse effect\n\tGreenhouse gases\n\tGlobal effects\n\tUK effects\n\tLinks\n\n\n\t\n\t\t   \n\t\t  \n\t\t\t\tRelated information\n\n\t\t\t\t\twww.climatechallenge.gov.uk\n\tHow is Defra tackling\n\t\t\t\t  \t      climate change?\n\tLinks to related\n\t\t\t          sites\n\tClimate change and education\n\tIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n\tUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n\tHadley Centre\n\n\n\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tKey material\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUK Climate Change Programme\n\tReview of UK Climate Change Programme\n\n\n\t\t   \n\n\t\t\n\n \n\t\t  \n\n\t\t  \n\t\n\t \t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tPage last modified: 01 December, 2005\n\nPage published: 01 December, 2005\n\t\t  \n\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\tTop | Help  |  Feedback |  Access Keys  |  Copyright/Terms  |  Privacy\t  Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\n\n\n\n",

          "Advisory Cabinet Agendas – Forward PlanningGreater Mayor' Mayor's Advisor s Advisory y Cabinet  Cabinet\nMayor' Mayor's Advisor s Advisory y Cabinet  Cabinet\nLondon\nAuthority\n19 December 2000\nReport Number: 2\nSubject: Homes for a World City\nAuthor: The Mayor\nSummary\nThis paper presents some initial proposals for taking forward the\nrecommendations of the report of the Housing Commission.\n1. The Housing Commission, chaired by Chris Holmes (Director of Shelter),\nand supported by a panel of eighteen experts in housing and related\nissues, reported to me the results of a three month inquiry into the\n• requirement for affordable housing in London\n• housing polices to be included in the Spatial Development Strategy\n• targets for affordable housing across London.\n2. The Commission drew on evidence gained in thirty visits and meetings\nwith key housing and employing organisations in London. It received an\nenthusiastic response from 135 organisations and individuals who\nprovided written submissions. The Commission was also able to draw on a\nrange of new research, including an analysis of the need for affordable\nhousing in London from the Authority’s Research Group.\n3. The Commission’s report was launched on 16 November and has been\nwidely welcomed by partners and stakeholders from all sectors.\n4. The report estimated that 31,800 additional homes are needed each year\nfor the next ten years to meet newly arising demand in London with a\nfurther 11,200 homes to deal with the backlog of homelessness,\novercrowding and poor housing conditions. The report also recommended\nthat half of all new homes should be for those who cannot afford full\nmarket costs. Thirty-five per cent should be for those on low incomes and\nfifteen per cent in London should be targeted at people on moderateincomes with an initial focus on the needs of workers in key public sector\nservices vital for London’s economic future.\n5. Overall, the report provides clear evidence for a major increase in the\nprovision of affordable homes in London. Housing is a mainstream\neconomic issue not a peripheral social issue. The lack of affordable\nhousing is a major constraint on the London economy and the ability of\nbusinesses and public services – especially health, education, police and\ntransport – to recruit and retain staff. An effective labour market includes\npeople on low and moderate incomes as well as those on high incomes.\nWhat next?\n6. The report will build on the wide and deep recognition, across all agencies,\nthat London cannot afford not to provide an adequate number and quality\nof affordable homes. There is a will across London’s agencies to work in\npartnership and the Commission’s report represents one step forward in\nthe development of the planning framework and a housing strategy for\nLondon. In the immediate term, the next steps will include:\nThe establishment of a Regional Housing Forum.\n7. In line with the Commission’s recommendation I will be putting forward\nproposals for establishing a London Housing Forum to co-ordinate strategy\nacross the public, private and voluntary sectors and identify priorities for\naction.\nPreparation of Interim Affordable Housing Policy Statement\n8. The Housing Commission recommended that there should be a\ncomprehensive financial impact assessment of the planning policies which\nit proposed to ensure that any targets set were as robust and firmly based\nin evidence as possible and that policy should achieve the maximum\ncontribution from the private sector without jeopardising the supply of land\nfor housing.  The GLA has commissioned consultants to carry out this\nassessment in co-operation with London Boroughs, housebuilders, and\nRegistered Social Landlords.  Following their report which is expected at\nthe end of February I expect to publish for consultation in advance of the\nfull draft Spatial Development Strategy an Interim Affordable Housing\nPolicy Statement.\nAn inquiry into the modernisation of the private rented sector in London\n9. Fifteen per cent of London’s households rent privately in London. Private\nrenting adds to the flexibility and mobility of the London housing market and\nthe sector is likely to continue to play a significant role for the foreseeable\nfuture. Much needs to be done to effect improvements to the lower end of\nthe market. The Authority also needs to maximise the opportunities\npresented by current interest from financial institutions keen to invest in\nnew initiatives to provide private rented accommodation for key workers.\nAdditional research programme\n10. The Commission recommended a number of important areas where\nadditional research was required.  My budget proposals for the Core GLAinclude additional budget provision for such research.  Besides the private\nrented sector inquiry initial priorities include\n• additional work on the housing needs of people on moderate incomes\nand key workers\n• additional survey work to assist Boroughs in establishing borough-level\ntargets for affordable housing taking account of both local and pan-\nLondon needs\n• further work on maximising availability of land across London for\nhousing developments\nWherever possible such research will be carried out in partnership with\nother agencies.\n",

Fri 27 Aug 2004\n\n\tQaisra Shahraz, with her book The Holy Woman has started a new writing trend of fusing religion with English fiction writing. Bina Shah, a relatively known name in the literary world, picks up on this trend in her new book, The 786 Cybercafé. \n\n\n\nThe 786 Cybercafé is an apt title for this book (?786? is a common abbreviation for ?In the name of Allah?) as it brilliantly combines the popular concepts of religion and technology. The Internet is now a global phenomenon. Pakistan is no exception and internet café?s are proving extremely popular places for the younger generation. While only some of these café?s are involved in actively promoting pornography, most provide access to adult sites. Shah?s concern is simple. The Islamic Republic of Pakistan is a country which was explicitly created in the name of religion.  The people behind its creation had a dream of making it into a land where Islam would flourish. How then can such brazen activities, contrary to the spirit of Islam, be prevalent in a country with such a unique history?\n\n\n\nJamal, is Shah?s rough-edged protagonist who shares the all too common dream of an average sub-continent man: he wants to make money, make it fast, and make lots and lots of it. \n\nWith his nerdy brother Abdul, a computer  expert, and his friend Yasir who provides the financial backing, they form a team and open up The 786 Cybercafé on Karachi?s Tariq Road. It is against this backdrop that Shah puts forward a very important question: how do Jamal, Abdul and Yasir handle the paradox of their café?s name and the pornography that customers come in to surf? Jamal simply turns a blind eye to such goings-on, because he is busy adding up the profits. Yasir, however, goes apoplectic with indignation when he finds out. \n\n\n\nThe running sectarian tension in the book echoes another alarming reality of  Muslim culture in South Asia. This theme runs beautifully in the background as Shah concentrates on her main story. \n\n\n\nThe 786 Cybercafé highlights a current controversy that is developing in the sub-continent. Shah tactfully opens up a moral debate and highlights varied and often deeply flawed ethical stances  people adopt on issues of pornography, religious high-handedness and the right to autonomy.\n\nThis is a challenging book that I recommend for more than just leisure reading. \n\n\n\nReema Khan\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\n\t\n\t \nInternal Links\n\tBrick Lane\n\tThe Holy Woman by Qaisra Shahraz\n\n\n\n\t\n\t \nExternal Links\n\tTwenty first century woman\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tMCBDirect \n\n\n",
