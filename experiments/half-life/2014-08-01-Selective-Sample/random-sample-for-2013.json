In Pembrokeshire, the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority (PCNPA) has made a number of agreements with other bodies to jointly fund warden posts to improve services to the public and landowners.\n\n          \n\n\n          The Authority pays about 20% of the cost of a water ranger post, with the Milford Haven Port Authority funding the remainder. The ranger patrols the Milford Haven Waterway and the Daugleddau up to the tidal limits and is the main contact for recreational matters within the Port Authority. Liaising with users and waterside landowners is a priority to reduce environmental damage and conflicts with other users and the community. The ranger has had a number of successes in improving the situation.\n \n\n          At Castlemartin, PCNPA funds 25% of a ranger, with the Countryside Council for Wales paying a further 25% and the army funding the remaining 50%. The ranger works to deliver the army's Integrated Land Management Plan for the ranges to the production of which a group of partner organisations contributed. PCNPA led on producing the recreation sub-plan. The ranger implements the Plan, liaising with climbers, outdoor activity centres and the community as well as carrying out biological monitoring.\n\n\n          There are a number of villages where both PCNPA and Pembrokeshire County Council have land or facilities and to which they have both sent work parties to clean up/cut grass etc. In one area, they have both agreed to contract the work out to a local individual with resultant savings to both organizations. PCC leads this initiative but both organisations are seeking opportunities to roll this village warden arrangement out to other areas.\n\n\n          PCNPA established a jointly-funded ranger post with a private sector company which operates large caravan parks near Tenby. Experience had shown that there were substantial numbers of families with children and that most visitors did not make very much use of what the National Park had to offer. The advantage to the Authority was that such a post would start to break down the barriers which were preventing visitors, and particularly the children, from benefiting from the Park. The advantage to the company was that the post allowed it to advertise more activities which were popular with children and which increased the enjoyment and understanding of both the children and their parents. The scheme originally involved both partners contributing ?1000 each to fund a warden post during July and August. From there it has expanded to the full season from April to October with the company paying around 90% of the cost. It has now extended the idea to other sites around England and Wales and advertises \"green breaks\" for countryside experiences.\n\n\n          The Pembrokeshire Coastal Forum is a partnership of several organizations (PCNPA, Pembrokeshire County Council, Milford Haven Port Authority, Countryside Council for Wales, the Environment Agency, the National Trust, Crown Estates and the private sector) seeking to develop an integrated approach to coastal management (ICZM). There are three staff. The Forum does research, provides information and advice surgeries and advises on recreation development. It employs an Activities Liaison Officer who coordinates the development of the Pembrokeshire Marine Code and the Pembrokeshire Outdoor Charter. These initiatives helped develop information and training for businesses providing boat trips and outdoor activity experiences around the National Park and have enabled greater confidence in the sustainability of an expanding activity sector.\n\n\n          (www.pembrokeshireoutdoors.org.uk/ and www.pembrokeshiremarinecode.org.uk)\n\n\n          The key factors for success in these schemes are the willingness to look for appropriate long-term partners in a variety of imaginative schemes; to joint-fund posts; and to maintain the focus on customer service.\n\n\n          \n            Contact Name: Charles Mathieson\n\n            Contact Role: Recreational Management Officer\n\n            Contact Telephone: 01437-7698901\n\n            Contact Email: charlesm@pembrokeshirecoast.org.uk\n\n            Contact Address: Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority\n\n            Llanion Park\n\n            Pembroke Dock\n\n            Pembrokeshire\n\n            SA72 6DY?\n\n            Website: www.pcnpa.org.uk\n\n          \n\n        \n\n      \n\n    \n\n\n    \n      \tFollow us on Twitter now for the latest news\n\tTel: 029 2032 0500\n\tEmail: info@wao.gov.uk\n\t?

The Royal Society of Chemistry, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC) are all pleased to be supporting this event.\n\nThis event will focus on:\n\n? The insight into the cutting edge research of bio technologies and its applications in the commercial world, with successful partnership and collaboration between academia and industry for new product development\n\n? The importance and awareness of industrial perspective to the subject and tips on profitable ongoing commercialisation and use of nanomaterials in industry\n\n? The commercial view to try and find out what are the limiting issues to commercialising any academic ideas and cultures we need to understand for business\n\nIt will provide an ideal opportunity for networking and discussion between successful entrepreneurial academics, small and large companies, and consultants. It will also encourage and create partnership between similar minded universities and industries sharing common interests and goals.\n\nFurther information including a booking form and programme is available at: http://industry.iop.org, or by email from: dipali.chauhan@iop.org\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tSearch\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHome\n\tAbout\n\tServices\n\tDomains\n\tClients\n\tAccelerator\n\tNews & Events\n\tContact us\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTerms & conditions - Privacy statement - Site map\n\n\t\t\t\tCopyright ?

Substance Misuse \n \nJo Daykin-Goodall presented an overview of substance misuse.  \n \n? A comprehensive needs assessment has been undertaken in relation to drug \nmisuse. \n? Two alcohol strategies (one for adults and one for young people) have been \ncommissioned. \n \nKey Points Raised: \n \nIs there a correlation between alcohol misuse and domestic violence? \nThere is, but it is not integrated within any drug statistics. Better co-ordination of data is \nrequired. \n \nWhat happens to drug users after treatment? \nIf someone stays in treatment for 12 weeks, the chances of a continuing recovery is \nincreased. The new data collection system, which is to be launched this year, will enable us \nto track people a lot better. \n \nWhat is the legal basis for getting someone into treatment? \nGenerally admission is voluntary (including voluntary referrals via GPs etc).  However, \noffenders who are arrested for a trigger offence are tested and those who test positive are \nreferred to the Drug Interventions Programme. \n \nDo you have a view on availability of drugs and alcohol?  Is it particularly bad in Sheffield? \nAnyone who wants to use drugs will get them from somewhere.  More attention should be \ngiven to preparing communities for when there is a big drugs raid; sometimes if there is a \nsuccessful police raid and a particular drug i.e. cannabis is in short supply, there is a risk \nthat young people will move onto another more dangerous drug. Close liaison with the \npolice could result in community interventions to respond to any sudden shortage and help \nprevent young people in particular from progressing onto stronger and more dangerous \nsubstances.  \n \nIs the capacity in place to accept more people into treatment? \nIf the level of investment is sustained, then yes, but this could change in a year if funding is \nreduced. It depends how much it remains a national priority. \n \nWhere should the funding come from to address alcohol misuse? \nIt is a partnership matter.  At the moment spending on alcohol abuse is unknown.  We need \nto know what we have, before we can identify what more we need. \n \nFurther comments \n \nThe VCF sector have many preventative drugs and alcohol programmes and these should \nbe considered with equal importance. The DAAT is responsible for developing a treatment \nsystem and will focus on the system rather than individual providers. \n \nSPAR - Single Point of Assessment Referral ? There is a telephone number in Sheffield for \nthe referral of individuals who might require a specialist prescribing service. The client is \n30/08/2007/KW                             - 3 - v \nassessed and receives a score; the score determines whether the client receives specialist \nprescribing from their GP, Primary Care Clinic Drug Dependence or Sheffield Care Trust.  \n \nACTION: \n1. Report back to SFHW when the Alcohol Strategies are complete. JD-G \n \n \n4. Commissioning Framework for Health and Well-Being \n \nCath Roff and Simon Kirk presented a draft response to the Commissioning Framework for \nHealth and well-being.   \n \nKey Points raised: \n \nWill you be thinking laterally about what is needed in terms of providing services in the \ncommissioning process?   \nThis will be picked up in the Commissioning Framework and there should be a number of \nrelated documents. \n \nThe GP practice has been the main gatekeeper for health services in the last 50 years, and \nthey need to be part of the solution.  Can we ensure that quality issues are integral in \nmoving this forward? \nInspection and quality will be uppermost.  A lot of standards will need to be brought in to \nsafeguard individuals in this new system. \n \nHow far is the framework going to extend across a patient?s illness? \nIt will eventually manifest itself as a Commissioning Framework.   \n \nWill this new system be difficult for the public to understand and utilise? \nPeople will be able to seek advice to help them make decisions. \n \nWill there need to be a shift in targets to accommodate the new way of working? \nThe targets are aligned, but will need to be extended to achieve actual well-being.   \n \nACTION: \n2. Report back to SFHW at next stage of develoments. CR/SK \n5. City Strategy Light Touch Review \n \nSir Bob Kerslake gave a summary presentation of the review. \n \nKey Points Raised: \n \nThe new proposed strategy excludes the WHO Healthy Cities Programme, the Health \nCompact work, and any connection to other partnerships or national/regional strategies.  \nThis may need to be readdressed. \n \nACTION: \n3. Comments on consultation papers (structure, overall direction,  \nhealth & well-being priorities and targets) to be sent to Roz Davies ALL \nby end May. \n30/08/2007/KW                             - 4 - v \n4. Revise health and well-being priorities incorporating those RD \npreviously in the Strategy and the health impact of climate change. \n \nBUSINESS \n \n6. Minutes and Matters Arising \n \nItem 2, Page 3:  There was an error in the answer to the following question: \n \n?How will investment be targeted to communities of interest with poor health such as \npeople with learning difficulties?? \n \nThe answer should read? \n \n?A key pretext of the strategy is to direct services to those with most need, meeting the \nneeds of specific communities will need to be through the commission of appropriate \nservices for them.? \n \nAll of the action points have been taken forward except for Action 8 under Item 7 which will \nbe addressed. \n \n \n7. Annual Reports: \n \n7.1       WHO Healthy City Programme \n \nKieron Williams presented the Annual Report. \n \nKey Points Raised: \n \nFuture core themes that might be looked at are: \n \nMigration and Health \nEmergency Planning \nEconomic/Creative Cities Agenda \nChildren & Young People \nCommunity/Neighbourhood based health inequalities intervention \n \nWhat can Sheffield do as a key city in combating climate change?   \nThis should be a valid theme for Phase V and also be incorporated in the City Strategy. \n \nWhat are the practical points for public and voluntary engagement in Healthy Cities?   \nIn terms of joint working, those who want to be engaged should just ask. \n \nThe Board agreed the recommendations.  \n \nACTIONS: \n5. Produce a benchmarking comparison with other cities which are  \nsuccessful in priority areas and/or similar to Sheffield. KW \n6. Carry out a rapid health impact assessment on the City  \nStrategy/LAA and Housing Strategies KW \n30/08/2007/KW                             - 5 - v \n7. Incorporate changes to public engagement as suggested in the  \nannual report. KW \n \n7.2 Healthier Communities \n \nChris Nield presented the Healthier Communities Annual Report. \n \nThe Board agreed the recommendations. \n \n7.3 Older People \n \nCath Roff presented the Older People Annual Report. \n \nThe Board approved the Report. \n \n \n7.4 Health Compact \n \nNick Pearson presented the Health Compact Annual Report. \n \nThe Board approved the Annual Report. \n \nPost Meeting Note? \nThe Health Compact is amongst the first compacts to carry out work on Full Cost Recovery \nand developing monitoring and evaluation systems. Nick Pearson has been asked to report \nback to a number of Compacts across the country on the work done in these areas. \n \n7.5 Smoking \n \nJohn Soady gave a brief update on progress since his previous presentation to the Board in \nSeptember. \n \nThe Board approved the recommendations. \n \n8. AOB \n \nThere was no other business. \n \n9. Date of Next Meeting \n \nThe next Sheffield First Health & Well-Being Board will be held on 17 July 2007, 1.00-\n4.00pm, Town Hall. \n30/08/2007/KW                             - 6 - \n",

          " Strategic Commissioning Group    \n \n    West Midlands \n \n \n \n \n[ Insert Organisational Logo ] \n \n \nCommissioning Policy  \n \nIndividual funding requests (WM/9) \n \nVersion 1 ? April 2010 \n \n \n1. Definitions \n \nTreatment means any form of healthcare intervention which has been proposed by a \nclinician and is proposed to be administered as part of NHS commissioned and \nfunded healthcare. \n \nAn individual funding request is a request received from a provider, or a patient with \nexplicit support from a clinician, which seeks funding for a single identified patient for \na specific treatment. \n \nClinical circumstances means a full history of the patient?s medical condition, a full \ndescription of the patient?s present medical condition and as comprehensive an \nassessment of the patient?s future medical condition and prognosis as the Clinical \nTeam treating the patient is able to provide. \n \nThe IFR Panel is the committee of the Primary Care Trust that has been authorised \nby the Primary Care Trust?s Board to take decisions on its behalf on individual \nfunding requests. \n \nCase by case decision making, in the context of priority setting, occurs when a \ndecision maker decides to allocate NHS resources for a specified treatment for one \nor more specified patients as a substitute for policy making. This is generally \nregarded as poor practice because it avoids making an explicit policy. \n \nExceptional clinical circumstances refers to a patient who has clinical circumstances \nwhich, taken as a whole, are outside the range of clinical circumstances presented by \na patient within the normal population of patients with the same medical condition \nand at the same stage of progression as the patient. \nIndividual funding request policy \nVersion 1 ? April 2010                                                                                     Page 1 of 10  \nResponsible Primary Care Trust means the Primary Care Trust which discharges the \nSecretary of State's functions under the National Health Service Act 2006 for an \nindividual patient. \n \nRule of rescue is the observation that human beings, in situations where an \nindividual?s life is at risk, have the proclivity to take action to rescue the individual \nregardless of the cost and the chances of success. Action taken, therefore, is in part \nabout meeting the emotional needs of the decision maker. In the healthcare setting \nthe term has been used in a number of ways.  In the West Midlands the term refers \nto agreeing funding for treatments for patients whose prognosis is grave on the basis \nthat their prognosis is grave and without regard to cost or ability to benefit. \n \nExperimental and unproven treatments are medical treatments or proposed \ntreatments where there is no established body of evidence to show that the \ntreatments are clinically effective.  The reasons may include the following: \n \n? The treatment is still undergoing clinical trials for the indication in question. \n? The evidence is not available for public scrutiny. \n? The treatment does not have approval from the relevant government body. \n? The treatment does not conform to an established clinical practice in the view of \nthe majority of medical practitioners in the relevant field. \n? The treatment is being used in a way other than that previously studied or for \nwhich it has been granted approval by the relevant government body. \n? The treatment is rarely used, novel, or unknown and there is a lack of evidence \nof safety and efficacy. \n? There is some evidence to support a case for clinical effectiveness but the \noverall quantity and quality of that evidence is such that the commissioner does \nnot have confidence in the evidence base and/or there is too great a measure of \nuncertainty over whether the claims made for a treatment can be justified. \n \nA service development is any aspect of healthcare which the PCT has not historically \nagreed to fund and which will require additional and predictable recurrent funding.  \nThe term refers to all new developments including new services, new treatments \n(including medicines), changes to treatment thresholds, and quality improvements.  It \nalso encompasses other types of investment that existing services might need, such \nas pump-priming to establish new models of care, training to meet anticipated \nmanpower shortages and implementing legal reforms.  Equitable priority setting \ndictates that potential service developments should be assessed and prioritised \nagainst each other within the annual commissioning round.  However, where \ninvestment is made outside of the annual commissioning round, such investment is \nreferred to as an in-year service development. \n \nAn in-year service development is any aspect of healthcare, other than one which is \nthe subject of a successful individual funding request, which the Primary Care Trust \nagrees to fund outside of the annual commissioning round.  Unplanned investment \ndecisions should only be made in exceptional circumstances because, unless they \ncan be funded through disinvestment, they will have to be funded as a result of either \ndelaying or aborting other planned developments. \n \nA policy variation occurs when an existing policy is changed. When there is a \nproposal which would result in increased access to a treatment (for example by \nlowering the threshold for treatment or adding a new indication for treatment) the \npolicy variation is a service development and will be treated as such.   \nIndividual funding request policy \nVersion 1 ? April 2010                                                                                     Page 2 of 10  \nA Similar Patient refers to the existence of a patient within the patient population who \nis likely to be in the same or similar clinical circumstances as the requesting patient \nand who could reasonably be expected to benefit from the requested treatment to the \nsame or a similar degree. When the treatment meets the regional criteria for regional \npolicy making, then the similar patient may be in another PCT in the West Midlands \nregion. Most often there is more than one patient in this category. \n \nThe existence of one or more similar patients indicates that a policy position is \nrequired of the PCT. \n \n \n2. The policy \n \n2.1 This policy applies to any patient for whom the PCT is the Responsible \nCommissioner. \n \n2.2 Patients or their clinician are entitled to make a request (an ?individual \nfunding request?) to the IFR Panel for treatment to be funded by the PCT \noutside of its established policies on one of two grounds, namely: \n \n2.2.1 The patient is suffering from a presenting medical condition for which \nthe PCT has no policy (?an individual request?), or \n \n2.2.2 The patient is suffering from a presenting medical condition for which \nthe PCT has a policy but where the patient?s particular clinical \ncircumstances falls outside what the PCT has agreed to fund (?an \nexceptionality request?). \n \n2.3 All applications must be accompanied by written support and evidence \nprovided by the clinical team treating the patient explaining: \n \n2.3.1 Whether the request for funding is an individual request or an \nexceptionality request. \n \n2.3.2 The clinical circumstance of the patient.  \n \nThe patient and the Clinical Team are required to present a full report \nto the IFR Panel which sets out a comprehensive and balanced \nclinical picture of the history and present state of the patient?s medical \ncondition, the nature of the treatment requested and the anticipated \nbenefits of the treatment. \n \n2.3.3 The planned treatment and the expected benefits and risks of \ntreatment.  \n \nThe Clinical Team shall describe the anticipated clinical outcomes for \nthe individual patient of the proposed treatment and the degree of \nconfidence of the Clinical Team that the outcomes will be delivered for \nthis particular patient. \n \n2.3.4 The evidence on which the clinical opinion is based. \n \nIndividual funding request policy \nVersion 1 ? April 2010                                                                                     Page 3 of 10 The Clinical Team shall refer to, and preferably include, copies of any \nclinical research material which supports, questions or undermines the \ncase that is being made that the treatment is likely to be clinically \neffective in the case of the individual patient.  \n \n2.3.5 The costs of treatment.  \n \nThe patient and the Clinical Team shall set out the full attributable \ncosts of and connected to the treatment.  The IFR Panel shall be \nentitled but not obliged to commission its own reports from any duly \nqualified or experienced clinician or other duly qualified person \nconcerning the full attributable costs of and connected to the \ntreatment. \n \n2.3.6 Whether or not there are likely to be Similar Patients either within the \nPCT or across the region. \n \nFor exceptionality requests the clinician must also provide the case \nfor treating this patient and not other apparently similar patients.   \n \n2.3.7 Any other information necessary.  For example for individual requests\n where funding is being sought to enable a patient to be entered into a \nclinical trial the protocol for the trial should be forwarded. \n \n2.4 Information that is immaterial to the decision, including information about the \nsocial or personal circumstances of the patient which does not have a direct \nconnection to the patient?s clinical circumstances, shall not be considered by \nthe IFR Panel.   \n \n2.5 The IFR Panel shall be entitled to approve requests for funding for treatment \nfor individual patients where all the following conditions are met: \n \n2.5.1 The IFR Panel concludes that there are likely to be no Similar \nPatients to the requesting patient. \n \n2.5.1.1 The IFR Panel shall consider whether or not there are likely to \nbe Similar Patients.  When this is the case the IFR Panel shall \nnot be entitled to make a decision on the request but shall be \nentitled to refer the treatment to be treated as a service \ndevelopment / in year service development. \n \n2.5.1.2 The IFR panel is not authorised to make case by case decision \nmaking for service developments. \n \n2.5.2 There is sufficient evidence to show that, for the individual \npatient, the proposed treatment is likely to be clinically and cost-\neffective \n \n2.5.2.1 The IFR Panel shall, based on the information before it, take a \nview on whether the treatment is both effective and cost-\neffective.   \n \n2.5.2.2 The IFR Panel is not required to accept the views expressed \nby the patient or the Clinical Team concerning the likely clinical \nIndividual funding request policy \nVersion 1 ?

The quality of the evidence to support that decision and/or \nthe degree of confidence that the IFR Panel has about the \nlikelihood of the proposed treatment delivering the \nproposed clinical outcomes for the individual patient. \n \n2.5.2.3 The IFR Panel shall be entitled but not obliged to commission \nits own reports from any duly qualified or experienced clinician, \nmedical scientist or other person having relevant skills \nconcerning the case that is being made that the treatment is \nlikely to be clinically effective in the case of the individual \npatient.  \n \n \n2.5.3 Individual requests only   \n  \n2.5.3.1 The IFR Panel will apply paragraphs 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8 of \nthe West Midlands Strategic Commissioning Group \nCommissioning Policy (WM14): Experimental treatments and \nunproven treatments when considering individual requests for \noff-licensed or unlicensed use of a drug or other unproven \ntreatments for the clinical condition under consideration. \n \n \n2.5.4 Exceptional requests only    \n \n2.5.4.1 The IFR Panel will consider exceptionality in the context of the \nrelevant commissioning policy/policies and guidance note/s. \n \n2.5.4.2 In determining whether a patient is able to demonstrate \nexceptional circumstances the IFR Panel shall compare the \npatient to other patients with the same presenting medical \ncondition at the same stage of progression. \n \n2.5.4.3 The IFR Panel shall determine, based upon the evidence \nprovided to the panel, whether the patient has demonstrated \nexceptional clinical circumstances.  The evidence to show that, \nfor the individual patient, the proposed treatment is likely to be \nclinically effective may be part of the case that the patient?s \nclinical circumstances are asserted to be exceptional. \n \n2.5.4.4 In deciding whether to approve funding, the IFR Panel shall \nremind itself that the policies of the PCT provide that medical \ntreatment is made available to patients generally on the basis \nof their presenting medical conditions and on the likely benefits \nanticipated to accrue to a patient from a proposed treatment.   \n \nIndividual funding request policy \nVersion 1 ? April 2010                                                                                     Page 5 of 10  The PCT does not discriminate on grounds of sex, age, sexual \norientation, ethnicity, educational level, employment, marital \nstatus or religion.  \n \nThe PCT does not generally make treatment for patients under \nits policies dependent on the patient?s social or personal \ncircumstances.  Accordingly, when making decisions as to \nwhether treatment should be provided to a patient which is not \nprovided to patients generally, the IFR Panel shall adopt the \nsame approach.  \n \n2.5.4.5 The IFR Panel shall take care to avoid adopting the approach \ndescribed in the ?the rule of rescue?.  The fact that a patient \nhas exhausted all NHS treatment options available for a \nparticular condition is unlikely, of itself, to be sufficient to \ndemonstrate exceptional circumstances.  Equally, the fact that \nthe patient is refractory to existing treatments where a \nrecognised proportion of patients with same presenting \nmedical condition at this stage are, to a greater or lesser \nextent, refractory to existing treatments is unlikely, of itself, to \nbe sufficient to demonstrate exceptional circumstances.   \n \n \n2.5.5 Treating the patient is higher priority than other unfunded \ndevelopments and the treatment can be afforded. \n \n2.5.5.1 The IFR Panel shall have a broad discretion to determine \nwhether the proposed treatment is a justifiable expenditure of \nthe PCT?s resources. The IFR panel is however required to \nbear in mind that the resources requested to support the \nindividual patient will reduce the availability of resources for \nother investments.  \n \n \n2.6 The IFR Panel may make such approval contingent on the fulfilment of such \nconditions as it considers fit. \n \n2.7 Very occasionally an individual funding request presents a new issue which \nneeds a substantial piece of work before the PCT can reach a conclusion \nupon its position.  This may include wide consultation.  Examples in the past \nhave included surrogacy and aspects of genetic testing.  Where this occurs \nthe IFR Panel may adjourn a decision on an individual case until that work \nhas been completed. \n \nIndividual funding request policy \nVersion 1 ? April 2010                                                                                     Page 6 of 10 Appeals \n \n2.8 The patient shall be entitled to lodge an appeal against the decision of the IFR \npanel within the time period set out in the PCT?s operating procedure for \nindividual funding requests.  Any such appeal will be heard by the PCT?s IFR \nAppeals Committee. \n \n2.9 The PCT?s operating procedure documents set out the membership and terms \nof reference of the IFR Appeals Committee. \n \n2.10 The IFR Appeals Committee is part of the corporate governance process of \nthe PCT. The role of the IFR Appeals Committee is to determine whether the \nIFR Panel has followed its own procedures, has properly considered the \nevidence presented to it and has come to a reasonable decision upon the \nevidence.   \n \n2.11 In the event that the IFR Appeals Committee considers that the IFR Panel \nhas:  \n \n? failed in a material way to follow its own procedures; and/or  \n? failed in a material way properly to consider the evidence presented to \nit (eg: by taking account of an immaterial fact or by failing to take \naccount of a material fact); and/or  \n? come to a decision that no reasonable IFR panel could have reached \non the evidence before the panel,  \n \nthe IFR Appeals Committee shall uphold the patient?s appeal and shall refer \nthe case for reconsideration by the IFR Panel. \n \n2.12 The IFR Appeals Committee shall not have power to authorise funding for the \nrequested treatment but shall have the right to make recommendations to the \nIFR Panel and to request one of the Officers authorised to take urgent \ndecisions. \n \nCo-operation of Provider Trusts  \n \n2.13  The PCT requires provider trusts and clinicians to take the PCT?s \ncommissioning policies into account in the advice and guidance given to \npatients prior to making the decision to treat a patient, as set out in the NHS \nContract. The PCT expects the Management of its provider trusts to have \noversight of this process. The PCT would expect every individual funding \nrequest to be sanctioned by provider trust management and reserves the right \nto refer recurrent inappropriate funding requests to the Chief Executive of the \nrelevant provider trust.  \n \nUrgent treatment decisions \n \n2.14  The PCT recognises that there will be occasions when an urgent decision \nneeds to be made to consider approving funding for treatment for an \nindividual patient outside the PCT?s normal policies.  In such circumstances \nthe PCT recognises that an urgent decision may have to be made before a \npanel can be convened.  The following provisions apply to such a situation. \n \nIndividual funding request policy \nVersion 1 ? April 2010                                                                                     Page 7 of 10 2.15  An urgent request is one which requires urgent consideration and a decision \nbecause the patient faces a substantial risk of significant harm if a decision is \nnot made before the next scheduled meeting of the IFR Panel.  \n \n2.16  Urgency under this policy cannot arise as the result of a failure by the Clinical \nTeam expeditiously to seek funding through the appropriate route and/or \nwhere the patient?s legitimate expectations have been raised by a \ncommitment being given by the provider trust to provide a specific treatment \nto the patient.  In such circumstances the PCT expects the provider trust to go \nahead with treatment.  \n \n2.17  Provider trusts must take all reasonable steps to minimise the need for urgent \nrequests to be made through the IFR process.  If clinicians from any provider \ntrust are considered by the PCT not to be taking all reasonable steps to \nminimise urgent requests to the IFR process, the PCT may refer the matter to \nthe provider Trust Chief Executive. \n \n2.18 Where an urgent decision needs to be made to authorise treatment for an \nindividual patient outside the PCT?s normal policies, the decision will be made \nby one of the senior staff delegated to make this decision as set out in the \nPCT?s operating procedures (the Authorised Officer). \n \n2.19  The Authorised Officer shall, as far as possible within the constraints of the \nurgent situation, follow the policy set out above in making the decision.  The \nAuthorised Officer shall consider the nature and severity of the patient?s \nclinical condition and the time period within which the decision needs to be \ntaken.  The Authorised Officer shall collect as much information about both \nthe patient?s illness and the treatment as is feasible in the time available and \nshall consider the request for funding in accordance with relevant existing \ncommissioning policies.   \n \n2.20 The Authorised Officer shall be entitled to reach the view that the decision is \nnot of sufficient urgency or of sufficient importance that a decision needs to \nbe made outside of the usual process. \n \n2.21 The Authorised Officer shall be entitled to reach the view that the request is, \nproperly analysed, a request for a service development and so should be \nrefused and/or appropriately referred for policy consideration.   \n \n2.22 Where the Authorised Officer considers that there is sufficient time to consult \nthe Chair and/or members of the IFR Panel before making an urgent decision, \nthe Authorised Officer shall do so and shall take any views into consideration \nbefore making a decision. \n \n3.

Symptoms of diverticular disease include:\n\n\tlower abdominal (stomach) pain\n\tfeeling bloated\n\n\nSymptoms of diverticulitis include:\n\n\tsevere abdominal pain\n\thigh temperature (fever) of 38?C (100.4?F) or above\n\n\nDiverticula, diverticular disease and diverticulitis\n\nDiverticula is the medical term that is used to describe the small pouches that stick out of the side of the large intestine (colon). Diverticula are very common and associated with ageing. It is estimated that 50% of people have diverticula by the time they are 50 years old, and 70% of people have them by the time they are 80 years old.\n\nThe majority of people with diverticula will not have any symptoms. However, 1 in 4 people with diverticula experience symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhoea. People who experience symptoms are said to have diverticular disease.\n\nThe diverticula can also become infected and inflamed. Inflammation of the diverticula is known as diverticulitis. Diverticulitis causes more severe symptoms than diverticular disease, such as severe pain. It carries a risk of causing serious complications, such as the colon rupturing (splitting), which can lead to an infection of the lining of the abdomen (peritonitis).\n\nHow common are diverticular disease and diverticulitis?\n\nDiverticular disease is one of the most common digestive conditions. Like the diverticula, diverticular disease is associated with age. About 75% of people with diverticular disease will have one or more episodes of diverticulitis.\n\nIt is estimated that 30% of people who are 60 years old or more are affected by diverticular disease. This figure rises to 65% for people who are 80 years of age or more.\n\nBoth sexes are equally affected by diverticular disease and diverticulitis, although the condition is more likely to appear at a younger age (under 50) in men than in women.\n\nDiverticular disease is often described as a ?western disease? because the rates are very high in western European and North American countries, and very low in African and Asian countries. Diet is thought to be the primary reason for this and, in particular, the fact that many people in western countries only eat a small amount of fibre. A low-fibre diet is known to be a significant risk factor for the condition.\n\nThe number of people who are affected by diverticular disease and diverticulitis is expected to rise over the next decade as a result of the corresponding increase in people who are 60 years of age or above.\n\nOutlook\n\nGenerally, the outlook for diverticular disease is good because the symptoms can usually be controlled by including more fibre in your diet.\n\nHowever, the outlook for diverticulitis is less favourable, as around 1 in 5 people will have complications that often require surgery to treat. In cases where no complications occur (uncomplicated diverticulitis), the recommended treatment is a short course of antibiotics.\n\nIf a person has repeated episodes of complicated diverticulitis, surgery to remove the affected section of the colon may be recommended as a preventative measure.\n\n            ^^ Back to top\n            \n\n        \n            \n            Symptoms\n\n            \nDiverticular disease\n\nThe most common symptom of diverticular disease is intermittent (stop-start) pain in your lower abdomen (stomach), usually in the lower left-hand side. The pain is often worse when you are eating, or shortly afterwards. Passing stools (faeces) and breaking wind (flatulence) may help to relieve the pain.\n\nOther symptoms of diverticular disease include:\n\n\ta change in your normal bowel habits, such as constipation or diarrhoea, or episodes of constipation that are followed by diarrhoea\n\tbloating\n\tbleeding from your rectum (back passage)\n\n\nDiverticulitis\n\nThe main symptom of diverticulitis is a constant and severe pain. The pain usually starts below your belly button, before moving to the lower left-hand side of your abdomen.\n\nIn Asian people, the pain may move to the lower right-hand side of your abdomen. This is because Asian people tend to develop diverticula in a different part of their colon. The reason for this is thought to be genetic (certain genes found in Asian people may change the natural course of the condition).\n\nBesides severe stomach pain, other symptoms of diverticulitis include:\n\n\ta high temperature (fever) of 38?C (100.4?F) or above\n\ta frequent need to urinate\n\tpain when you urinate\n\tnausea\n\tvomiting\n\tconstipation\n\tbleeding from your rectum (where solid waste is stored)\n\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\n\nContact your GP as soon as possible if you think you have symptoms of diverticulitis. The sooner diverticulitis?is?treated with antibiotics, the lower the risk of complications developing.\n\nIf you have the symptoms of diverticular disease and the condition has previously been diagnosed, you do not usually need to contact your GP because the symptoms can be treated at home. See?Diverticular disease and diverticulitis - treatment for more information.\n\nIf a diagnosis has not been confirmed, contact your GP so that they can rule out other conditions that have similar symptoms, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\n\nContact your GP if you have constant or heavy rectal bleeding. The bleeding is usually not painful, but if you lose too much blood you will need to go to hospital for a blood transfusion.\n\n\n\n            ^^ Back to top\n            \n\n        \n            \n            Causes\n\n            \nTo better understand the causes of diverticular disease and diverticulitis, it is useful to learn about the function of the colon.\n\nThe colon\n\nThe colon plays two important roles in the process of digestion. The colon:\n\n\thelps to remove the nutrients from the food that you eat\n\tpushes undigested waste products down into your rectum (the end of the large bowel) and out of your anus (back passage) where they are expelled from your body as stools (faeces)\n\n\nThe structure of your colon is similar to that of a tyre. It consists of a flexible inside layer of tissue that is covered by a firmer, tougher layer of muscle.\n\nLack of fibre\n\nNot eating enough fibre is thought to be a main reason why diverticula (the small pouches that stick out of the side of the colon) develop.\n\nFibre makes your stools softer and larger so that less pressure is needed by your colon to push them out of your body. Eating?low-fibre food produces small, hard stools. These are more difficult for the muscles of your colon to move, and will cause you to strain.\n\nThe pressure of moving the hard, small pieces of stools through your colon creates weak spots in the outside layer of muscle. This allows the inner layer to squeeze through these weak spots, creating the diverticula.\n\nThere is no clinical evidence to fully prove the link between fibre and diverticula, but the circumstantial evidence is compelling.\n\nFor example, in parts of the world where high-fibre diets are common, such as Africa and South Asia, cases of of diverticula and diverticula disease are almost non-existent. However, in western countries, where many people do not eat enough fibre, diverticula and diverticula disease are much more common.\n\nDiverticular disease\n\nIt is not known why only 1 in 4 people with diverticula go on to have the symptoms of diverticula disease.\n\nHowever, a number of risk factors have been identified that appear to increase your risk of developing diverticular disease. These include:\n\n\tsmoking\n\tbeing overweight or obese\n\thaving a history of constipation\n\tphysical inactivity\n\tuse of the?non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) type of painkillers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen\n\n\nExactly how these factors lead to the increased risk of developing diverticular disease is unclear.\n\nDiverticulitis\n\nDiverticulitis is caused by an infection of one or more of the diverticula (small pouches that stick out of the side of the large intestine).\n\nIt is thought that an infection can develop when a hard piece of stool (faeces) gets trapped in one of the pouches. This gives the bacteria in the stool the chance to multiply and spread, triggering an infection.\n\n\n\n            ^^ Back to top\n            \n\n        \n            \n            Diagnosis\n\n            \nDiverticular disease\n\nDiverticular disease can be difficult to diagnose from the symptoms alone because there are?many other conditions that cause similar symptoms, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a common but poorly understood condition that causes inflammation of the bowel.\n\nTherefore, as a first step, your GP may recommend that you have some blood tests. These tests cannot diagnosis diverticular disease but they can help to rule out other conditions.\n\nColonoscopy\n\nTo confirm the presence of diverticula (small pouches in the side of the colon) the inside of your large intestine (colon) will be looked at. One way of doing this is through a technique known as a colonoscopy.\n\nDuring a colonoscopy, a thin tube with a camera at the end (a colonoscope) is placed through your rectum and guided into your colon. Before the procedure begins, you will be given a laxative to clear out your bowels.\n\nColonoscopies are not painful because they are done under local anaesthetic (medication that numbs the surrounding area). However, you may feel a little discomfort during the procedure.\n\nBarium enema X-ray\n\nAnother technique for confirming the presence of diverticula is a barium enema X-ray. Barium is a liquid that shows up on X-rays. It is used to coat the inside surface of organs that do not show up on X-ray, such as the colon.\n\nAs with a colonoscopy, you will be given a laxative to clear out your bowels before you have a barium enema X-ray.\n\nDuring the procedure, a tube is inserted into your rectum. The barium liquid is squirted into the tube and passed up into your rectum. A series of X-rays are then taken. Although the procedure is not painful, some people may find it embarrassing.\n\nFor a few days after having a barium enema X-ray, your stools will appear white and discoloured due to the barium passing out of your body. It is nothing to worry about.\n\nDiverticulitis\n\nIf you have had a previous history of diverticular disease, your GP will usually be able to make a diagnosis of diverticulitis by carrying out a physical examination and asking you about your symptoms and medical history. A blood test may be taken because a high number of white blood cells can indicate the presence of infection.\n\nFurther tests will be needed if you have no previous history of diverticular disease. This is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out any other possible conditions, such as gallstones or a hernia.\n\nA barium enema X-ray may be used, as well as a computerised tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan takes a series of X-ray scans, which are then reassembled by a computer to build up a more detailed 3-D image of the inside of your body.\n\nA CT scan may also be used if your symptoms are particularly severe. This is to check whether the infection has spread to other parts of your body, or whether a complication, such as an abscess (a pus-filled cavity in the tissue), has occurred.\n\n\n\n            ^^ Back to top\n            \n\n        \n            \n            Treatment\n\n            \nDiverticular disease\n\nMost cases of diverticular disease can be treated at home. The over-the-counter (OTC) painkiller, paracetamol, is recommended to help relieve your symptoms.\n\nThe type of painkillers known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and ibuprofen, are not recommended because they may upset your stomach and increase your risk of internal bleeding.\n\nEating a high-fibre diet may initially help to control and resolve your symptoms of diverticular disease. Some people will notice an improvement after a few days, although it can take around a month for you to fully feel the benefits. See Diverticular disease and diverticulitis - prevention?for more information and advice about diet.\n\nIf you are having symptoms of constipation, you may be given a bulk-forming laxative. These can cause flatulence (wind) and bloating. Drink plenty of fluid to prevent any obstruction in your digestive system.\n\nHeavy or constant rectal bleeding occurs in about 1 in 3 cases of diverticular disease. This can happen if the blood vessels in your large intestine (colon) are weakened by the diverticula, making them vulnerable to damage. The bleeding is usually painless, but losing too much blood can be potentially serious.\n\nIf you have heavy rectal bleeding, you may need to be admitted to hospital so that you can be given a blood transfusion.\n\nDiverticulitis\n\nTreatment at home\n\nIf you have mild diverticulitis, the condition can often be treated at home. Your GP will prescribe antibiotics for the infection, and you should take paracetamol for the pain. If antibiotics are prescribed for you, it is important that you finish the complete course even if you are feeling better.\n\nSome types of antibiotics that are used to treat diverticulitis can cause side effects in some people. \n\n\n\nPossible side effects include:\n\n\tdrowsiness (do not drive if you have this side effect)\n\tnausea\n\tvomiting\n\tdiarrhoea?\n\n\nAlso, some antibiotics may react unpredictably if they are taken with alcohol. Therefore avoid drinking alcohol until you have finished taking your course of antibiotics.\n\nAntibiotics have been known to cause the contraceptive pill and patch to fail. Therefore use an additional form of contraception, such as a condom, when taking antibiotics, and for seven days afterwards. Your GP can give you advice about the types of antibiotics that are likely to cause a problem.\n\nYour GP may recommend that you stick to a fluid-only diet for a few days until your symptoms improve. This is because trying to digest solid foods may make your symptoms worse. You then gradually introduce solid foods over a two or three day period.\n\nTreatment at hospital\n\nIf you have more severe diverticulitis, you may need to go to hospital. Hospital treatment is usually recommended if:\n\n\tyour pain cannot be controlled using paracetamol\n\tyou are unable to drink enough fluids to keep you hydrated\n\tyou are unable to take oral antibiotics (tablets)\n\tyour general state of health is poor\n\tyou have a weakened immune system\n\tyour GP suspects complications\n\tyour symptoms fail to improve after two days (48 hours) of treatment at home\n\n\nIf you are admitted to hospital for treatment, you are likely?to receive injections of antibiotics and be kept hydrated and nourished using an intravenous drip (a tube that is directly connected to your vein). Most people start to improve within two to three days.\n\nSurgery\n\nIn the past, surgery was usually recommended as a preventative measure for people who had two episodes of uncomplicated diverticulitis,. It was believed that this would reduce their risk of developing serious complications in the future, such as peritonitis.\n\nBut nowadays most surgeons do not recommend surgery. This is because research has found that the risks of complications associated with having two episodes of uncomplicated diverticulitis are lower than were previously thought. For example, one study estimated that it would take 18 operations to prevent just one case of serious complications.\n\nThe surgery itself is also not risk free. Complications that lead to death can occur in 1 in every 100 cases. As with any form of medical treatment, surgery is only recommended if it is felt that the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nThe benefits and risks of surgery are currently determined on a case-by-case basis, as a ?one size fits all? type of recommendation is considered unhelpful. Factors that may cause surgery to be recommended include:\n\n\thaving a history of serious complications arising from a previous episode of diverticulitis\n\thaving symptoms of diverticular disease from at a young age (it is thought that the longer you live with diverticular disease, the greater your chances of having a serious complication)\n\thaving a weakened immune system or other underlying factors that make you more vulnerable to the effects of infection\n\n\nColectomy\n\nSurgery for diverticulitis involves removing the affected section of your colon. This is known as a colectomy. There are two ways that a colectomy can be performed:\n\n\tan open colectomy, where the surgeon makes a large incision (cut) in your abdomen and removes a section of your colon\n\tlaparoscopic colectomy - a type of ?keyhole surgery? where the surgeon makes a number of small incisions in your abdomen and uses special instruments that are guided by a camera to remove a section of colon\n\n\nOpen colectomies and laparoscopic colectomies are thought to be equally effective in treating diverticulitis, and have a similar risk of complications. Laparoscopic colectomies have the advantage of having a faster recovery time, and they cause less post-operative pain.\n\nLaparoscopic colectomies are a relatively new technique and may only be available at specialist surgical centres. There may also be a longer waiting time for this type of surgery.\n\nStoma surgery\n\nIn some cases, the surgeon may decide that your colon needs to heal before it can be reattached, or that too much of your colon has been removed to make reattachment possible. \n\n?\n\nIn such cases, it is necessary to find a way of removing wasting materials from your body without using all of your colon. This is done using stoma surgery.\n\nStoma surgery involves the surgeon making a small hole in your abdomen that is known as a stoma. There are two ways that stoma surgery can be carried out. These are explained below.\n\n\tAn ileostomy,?where a stoma is made in the right-hand side of your abdomen (stomach). Your small intestine is separated from your colon and connected to the stoma, and the rest of the colon is sealed. You will need to wear a pouch that is connected to the stoma to collect waste material.\n\tA colostomy,?where a stoma is made in your lower abdomen and a section of your colon is removed and connected to the stoma. As with an ileostomy, you will need to wear a pouch to collect waste material.\n\n\nIn most cases, the stoma will be temporary and can be removed once your colon has recovered from the effects of the surgery. This will usually take at least nine weeks.\n\nIf a large section of your colon is affected by diverticulitis and needs to removed, you may need to have a permanent ileostomy or colostomy.\n\nSee the A-Z topics about Ileostomy?and Colostomy?for more information.\n\nResults of surgery\n\nIn general terms, surgery is usually successful, although it does not achieve a complete cure in all cases. Following surgery, an estimated 8% of people will have a recurrence of the symptoms of diverticular disease and diverticulitis.?\n\n\n\n\n            ^^ Back to top\n            \n\n        \n            \n            Complications\n\n            Complications of diverticulitis affect 1 in 5 people with the condition. Those most at risk of developing complications are younger people (under 50 years of age) who need multiple admissions to hospital due to the severity of their symptoms.\n\nSome of the complications that are associated with diverticulitis are discussed below.\n\nAbscess\n\nThe most common complication of diverticulitis is the development of an abscess inside the large intestine (colon). An abscess is a pus-filled cavity or lump in the tissue. Abscesses are usually treated with a technique known as percutaneous abscess drainage (PAD).\n\nA radiologist (a specialist in the use of imaging equipment, such as computerised tomography scans) will use an ultrasound or CT scanner to locate the site of the abscess.\n\nA fine needle that is connected to a small tube will be passed through the skin of your abdomen (stomach) and into the abscess. The tube is then used to drain out the pus from the abscess. A PAD is performed under a local anaesthetic, so it is not particularly painful.\n\nDepending on the size of the abscess, the procedure may need to be repeated several times before all of the pus has been drained away. If the abscess is very small - usually less than 4cm (1.5in) - it may be possible to treat it using antibiotics.\n\nSee the?A-Z topic about?Abscess for more information.\n\nFistula\n\nAfter an abscess, a fistula is the second most common complication of diverticulitis. Fistulas are abnormal tunnels that connect two parts of the body together, such as your intestine and your abdominal wall or bladder.\n\nIf infected tissues come into contact with each other they can stick together. After the tissues have healed, a fistula may form. Fistulas can be potentially serious as they can allow bacteria in your large intestine (colon) to travel to other parts of your body, triggering infections, such as an infection of the bladder (cystitis).\n\nFistulas are usually treated with surgery to remove a small section of the colon that contains the fistula.\n\nSee the?A-Z topic about?Anal fistula for more information.\n\nPeritonitis\n\nIn rare cases, an infected diverticula (pouch in your colon) can rupture (split), spreading the infection into the lining of your abdomen (stomach). An infection of the lining of the abdomen is known as peritonitis.\n\nPeritonitis can be life-threatening, and requires immediate treatment with antibiotics. Surgery may also be required to repair any damage and to drain any pus that has built up.\n\nSee the?A-Z topic about Peritonitis?for more information.\n\nIntestinal obstruction\n\nIf the infection has badly scarred your colon, your colon may become partially or totally blocked. A totally blocked colon is a medical emergency because without immediate medical help, the tissue of your colon will start to decay and eventually rupture (split), leading to peritonitis.\n\nA partially blocked colon is not as urgent?a situation as a fully blocked one, but treatment is still needed. If left untreated, it will affect your ability to digest food. It will also cause you considerable pain.\n\nIn some cases, the blocked part of your colon can be removed during a colon resection (surgically removing the affected part of the colon). However, if the scarring and blockage is more extensive, a temporary or permanent colostomy may be needed.\n\n            ^^ Back to top\n            \n\n        \n            \n            Prevention\n\n            \nEating a high-fibre diet may help to prevent diverticular disease, and it may improve your symptoms.\n\nYour diet should be balanced and include at least five daily portions of fruit and vegetables, plus whole grains. Adults should aim to eat between 18g (0.6oz) to 30g (1.05oz) of fibre a day, depending on their height and weight. Your GP can provide a more specific target, based on your individual height and weight.\n\nIt is recommended that you gradually increase your fibre intake over the course of a few weeks. This will help to prevent the side effects associated with a high-fibre diet, such as bloating and flatulence (wind).\n\nAlso drink plenty of fluids because this will help to prevent any side effects.\n\nOnce you have reached your fibre target,?stick to it for the rest of your life if possible. The fibre found in certain fruits and vegetables is thought to be more effective in preventing diverticular disease that the fibre that is found in cereals. The reason for this is uncertain.\n\nGood sources of fibre in vegetables (plus the amount of fibre that is found in typical portions) include:\n\n\tred kidney beans ??three tablespoons contain 5.4g of fibre\n\tbaked beans ??a 100g can contains 3.7g of fibre\n\tpeas ??three heaped tablespoons contain 3.6g of fibre\n\tbrussel sprouts ??eight sprouts contain 3.3g of fibre\n\tpotatoes ??one medium-sized potato contains 2.4g of fibre\n\n\nGood sources of fibre in fruit (plus the amount of fibre that is found in typical portions) include:\n\n\tavocado pear ??one medium-sized avocado pear contains 4.9g of fibre\n\tpear (with skin) ??one medium-sized pear contains 3.7g of fibre\n\torange ??one medium-sized orange contains 2.7g of fibre\n\tapple ??one medium-sized apple contains 2g of fibre\n\tbanana ??one medium-sized banana contains 1.7g\n\n\nFibre supplements ??usually in the form of sachets of powder that you mix with water ??are also available from most pharmacists and health food shops.\n\nSee the Food Standards Agency (FSA) website for more information about fibre and high-fibre diets.\n\n\n\n            ^^ Back to top\n            \n\n        \n            \n

Symptoms include sickness and diarrhoea.\n\n\n\tIf you do become ill symptoms can last for 24-48 hours, but you will stay infectious for up to 48 hours after the symptoms have passed.\n\n\n\t?As a result, Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs St Richards Hospital in Chichester, Worthing Hospital and Southlands Hospital, is asking anyone who is planning to visit someone at one of their hospitals, but who has been ill within the last 48 hours, to stay at home.\n\n\n\t?Andrew Foulkes, a GP based in Yapton and Middleton, said: ?There are cases of sickness and diarrhoea in the community. I would encourage anyone suffering from these conditions to stay away from their general practices and hospitals. It can too easily be passed on to vulnerable patients and staff.\n\n\n\t?Anyone with these symptoms should stay at home, wash your hands regularly, drink lots of water and stay warm. If symptoms persist, or if there are other conditions or concerns, contact your GP for advice, the out-of-hours service, or phone NHS Direct.?\n\n\n\tSurrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs East Surrey Hospital, is providing general advice for visitors. This includes:\n\n\n\tStay home if unwell?-?Visitors should not come to the hospital if they feel unwell, or have been in the past week. If you suspect you have the virus first contact your GP or NHS Direct on 0845 4647, rather than coming to hospital\n\n\n\tStrict hand hygiene must be followed?- To limit risks of spreading the virus, visitors must use soap and water and wear protective clothing if requested. Alcohol gel is not effective in preventing or reducing symptoms of norovirus\n\n\n\tVisiting numbers?- Advice is to limit visitors to two people per patient. During an outbreak visitors are restricted to essential visiting only\n\n\n\tGifts?- Don?t bring any fruit or flowers\n\n\n\tEast Surrey Hospital has also put in measures to control and prevent the spread of infection, including strict hand hygiene, food-handling controls, prompt disinfection of contaminated areas and the isolation of those infected for 48 hours after their symptoms have ceased.\n\n\n\tPeople are being encouraged to stay at home if they think they have symptoms of the norovirus and those with suspected symptoms should contact their GP or phone NHS Direct. People should wash their hands regularly, drink lots of water and stay warm.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t?\n\n\t\t\n\t\t?\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n \t\tQuick links\n\n \t\t\tCustomer services\n\tSafeguarding children\n\tContact us\n\tMeet the NHS Sussex Board\n\tBoard meetings\n\tWorking for us\n\tPublications\n\tNewsletters\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n \t\tPopular pages\n\n\t\t\tServices\n\tFind a service\n\tLive well\n\tServices A-Z\n\tLose weight\n\tTalk to us\n\tNews\n\tAbout us\n\tNHS Constitution\n\tContact us\n\tProcurement opportunities\n\tProviding services for us\n\tWorking for us\n\tYour health records\n\tPublications\n\tProviding services for us\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tNHS West Sussex is the working name of West Sussex Primary Care Trust\n\n\t?Copyright West Sussex PCT 2010 ???????Intranet\n\n\tPrivacy | Disclaimer\n\n\n\t   \n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In England the rate is 28.5 per 100,000. These rates are below seasonal activity.\n\n?\n\nThe two vaccinations being used in the UK have now been licensed and GPs should start immunising within the next month. \n\n?\n\nOnly people who are registered with a GP will be offered immunisation which will be focused so that protection is offered to those who most need it. People with underlying health conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes, and pregnant women will be among a 14 million-strong nationwide priority group which will get the vaccine first along with health workers. \n\n?\n\nBy being able to start the vaccination programme before a sharp rise in new infections, NHS Eastern and Coastal Kent?s Deputy Director of Public Health Andrew Scott-Clark believes many lives could be saved. \n\n?\n\nHe said: \"Progress of the second wave of pandemic flu is proving to be slower than predicted. We may have got a lucky break with the way the virus has behaved giving us the opportunity to get the vaccinations underway.? \n\n?\n\nThe best way people can continue to protect themselves is by following good hygiene ? catch coughs or sneezes in a tissue and bin tissues as soon as possible. Simply remember: Catch It, Bin It, Kill It.\n\n?\n\nHe added: ?People should prepare themselves by stocking up on over-the-counter remedies and by identifying a flu friend ? someone who does not have swine flu ? who can pick up their antivirals and any other supplies for them should they become ill.?\n\n?\n\nAnyone suspecting they have swine flu can check their symptoms on the National Pandemic Flu Service website www.direct.gov.uk/pandemicflu or call 0800 1 513 100 or 0800 1 513 200. They should not visit their GP.\n\n?\n\nOnce people are confirmed with swine flu by the National Pandemic Flu Service, they will be given a unique authorisation number that the ?flu friend? can use to pick up the antivirals from a local antiviral collection point. \n\n?\n\nCallers to the service will be told where their nearest antiviral collection point is. \n\nHowever, people with swine flu symptoms should only contact their doctor direct rather than using the National Pandemic Flu Service if they:\n\n?\n\n\tHave a serious underlying illness \n\tAre pregnant \n\tHave a sick child under one year old \n\tRealise their condition is suddenly getting much worse \n\tThink their condition is still getting worse after seven days (five for a child). \n\n\n???? \n\n\n\n12 October\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n    \n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n    \n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n        \n\t\n    \n        \n\t        \n\t\t        Poll\n\n\t        \n\n        \n\n        \n\t        \n\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t        \n\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t\t        Do you know the recommended safe levels of alcohol that you can drink each week?\n\t\t\t\t        \n\n\t\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t\t        \tYes\n\tNo\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t        \n\n\t\t\t        \n\n\t\t        \n\n\t\t        \n\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t        \n\t\t        \n\n\t        \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t            Contact us\n\t\t\t\t        \n\n\t\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndependent contractors \n\t\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t        \n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n\t        \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t        \n\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t            ?

          "Paper D NHS SHEFFIELD  Board Meeting Transforming Community Services \n \nTransforming Community Services \n \nBoard Meeting \nD D \n \n1 February 2011 \n \nAuthor(s)/Presenter Jill Dentith, Head of Corporate Services  \nand title Julia Newton, Director of Finance \nSponsor Director Ian Atkinson, Interim Chief Executive \nPurpose of Paper \n \nAchieving the service transformation from Transforming Community Services (TCS) is a \ncritical element of delivering the strategic change which will be outlined in Achieving \nBalanced Health (4).  A key step is to achieve the actual transfer of services from the PCT \nto the new providers on 1 April 2011. The purpose of this paper is to update Board \nmembers on progress and highlight certain issues which are emerging as detailed \ndiscussions now take place. The paper also gives assurances to the board, not only on \nthe transactional process, but also the transformational vision that Partnership Boards \nhave committed to. The paper also asks the Board to sign off the final proposal for \nTransformation of Community Services in Sheffield, subject to the Foundation Trust \nBoards' approval. \n \nKey Messages  \n \n? Schedule 4 in each of the Heads of Agreement covered the key issues for \nresolution and work has continued to reach agreement on each issue. \n \n? Legally binding Business Transfer Agreements are currently being developed with \neach Foundation Trust. \n \n? We are in the process of submitting the assurances regarding choice from the \nFoundation Trusts and NHS Sheffield to Co-operation and Competition Panel \n(CCP).   \n \n? A separate submission to CCP has been made in relation to directly managed GP \nservices. This was sent by the target date of 14 January 2011 with signed Heads of \nAgreement for these services. CCP anticipates that case will take until early March \nto complete which means that the proposed transfer date for these services of        \n1 April 2011 is looking extremely challenging. \n \n? In response to concerns expressed by NHS Sheffield Board, the Children?s Shadow \nPartnership Board and Sheffield Teaching Hospital Trust have submitted \ninformation on how they want to assure NHS Sheffield Board of their intention to \nuse the opportunities and vision for the transformation of service. \n \n? The overall status for the project has been risk rated as red by the project board \ndue to the significant work which is still needed to resolve funding levels that are \nsatisfactory to both NHS Sheffield and the three FTs, staffing transfer details and \narrangements for transfer/occupation of capital assets. The issues are being \n1\n \nNHS Sheffield is the Sheffield Primary Care Trust D\nworked through by Directors of Finance and project leads as a matter of priority by \nall organisations but the scale and complexity of the tasks involved are significant, \nparticularly due to the proposed three-way split of the services. \n \n? The Board is asked to agree in principle, subject to approval by the respective \nfoundation trust, that the services currently provided by Sheffield PCT Provider \nServices be transferred to Sheffield Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, \nSheffield Children?s NHS Foundation Trust and Sheffield Health and Social Care \nNHS Foundation Trust as detailed in Appendix 3. \n \nStrategic/Performance implications including links to Achieving Balanced Health \n \nThis paper has been considered in light of ABH, Community Services Strategy, Estates \nStrategy and Procurement Plan. \n \nResource Implications  \n \nDependent upon model. \n \nLinks to Targets  \n \nBAF ref 2.1.5: to give Board assurance that due process has been followed in the \ndevelopment of these proposals. \n \nAssociated Risks to the PCT \n \nIf a robust process is not adopted the PCT may be at risk of challenge from staff, \nunsuccessful providers, potential providers, patients regarding lack of choice and the    \nCo-operation and Competition Panel. \n \nConsultation Requirements \n \nKey stakeholders and partners have been involved in developing these proposals.  \nOngoing discussion and dialogue is built into timeline as is formal TUPE consultation \n \nEquality/Diversity Impact \nA robust process will ensure that issues of equality and diversity are included in any \nassessment process. \n \nRecommendations \n \nNHS Sheffield Board is asked to: \n \n? Note progress in relation to Transforming Community Services. \n \n? Agree in principle, subject to approval by the respective foundation trust, that \nthe services currently provided by Sheffield PCT Provider Services be \ntransferred to Sheffield Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield \nChildren?s NHS Foundation Trust and Sheffield Health and Social Care NHS \nFoundation Trust as detailed in Appendix 3. \n \n2\n \nNHS Sheffield is the Sheffield Primary Care Trust  \n \nTransforming Community Services \n \n \nBoard Meeting \n \n1 February 2011 \n1 Introduction \n \nAchieving the service transformation from Transforming Community Services (TCS) \nis a critical element of delivering the strategic change which will be outlined in \nAchieving Balanced Health (4).  A key step is to achieve the actual transfer of \nservices from the PCT to the new providers on 1 April 2011. The purpose of this \npaper is to update Board members on progress and highlight certain issues which \nare emerging as detailed discussions now take place. The paper also gives \nassurances to the board, not only on the transactional process, but also the \ntransformational vision that Partnership Boards have committed to. The paper also \nasks the Board to sign off the final proposal for Transformation of Community \nServices in Sheffield subject to the Foundation Trust Boards approval. \n \n2 Heads of Agreement \n \nHeads of Agreement for all three foundation trusts have been agreed and signed by \nall parties.  \n \nDetailed work has taken place on Schedule 4 in each of the Heads of Agreement. \nSchedule 4 covers the key issues for resolution. For each issue a lead officer from \nNHS Sheffield is working with the relevant foundation trust lead to find a way \nforward as part of the contractual process or the business transfer agreement.  The \nlist of outstanding issues for resolution is slightly different for each trust, but \nessentially covers areas such as staff, capital and other assets, matters arising \nfrom financial, clinical and legal due diligence work and arising from the \nCommissioning Intentions document previously approved by NHS Sheffield?s \nBoard. \n \n3 Business Transfer Agreements \n \nThe Business Transfer Agreement provides the documentation in relation to \ntransfer of a range of assets, staff and contracts. This is a legally binding \ndocument.  A copy of the initial draft Transfer Agreement was shared with Board \nmembers in November 2010. An updated version will be presented to Board this \nmonth in private as this could be considered commercial in confidence.  \n \nNow the Heads of Agreement are signed, the Transfer Agreement will be populated \nand shared with partners to agree a final version.  This document should be agreed \nprior to 1 April 2011.  The Board will be asked to give delegated powers to the \nInterim Chief Executive or Director of Finance to change and sign on behalf of NHS \nSheffield. \n \n \n \n \n3\n \nNHS Sheffield is the Sheffield Primary Care Trust 4  Feedback from Co-operation and Competition Panel (CCP) \n   \nAt the last meeting of the Board we confirmed that we had been advised by the \nCCP that in agreement with the Department of Health and Monitor they will not \nprovide formal advice and recommendations on some mergers. This will be the \ncase for the Sheffield proposal, excluding Primary Care Trust Medical Services. \nThis was conditional upon the CCP being provided with statements on choice. We \nare in the process of submitting the relevant assurances from the Foundation \nTrusts and NHS Sheffield to CCP.   \n \n5 Primary Care Trust Medical Services (PCTMS) \n \nIt is proposed that Primary Care Trust Medical Services (PCTMS) be transferred to \nSheffield Health and Social Care Trust. CCP have advised that the proposal around \nPCTMS will remain subject to CCP review.  A separate submission has been made \nto CCP regarding these services which included a signed Heads of Agreement.  \n \nCCP have advised that they will select a case involving the transfer of GPs out of a \nPCT provider arm to consider the potential issues in the context of the Principles \nand Rules for Cooperation and Competition. CCP anticipate that case will take until \nearly March to complete and they intend to use information from the Sheffield \nsubmission, and other similar cases, when reaching their view to consider as many \nvariations of the issues as possible. At stages of the case CCP are likely to ask \nquestions to confirm their understanding of our arrangements. By taking this \napproach CCP anticipate applying a fast-track type review to the remaining seven \nor eight cases, including the Sheffield submission. If CCP can complete the first \ncase earlier they will be in a position to provide a view on the Sheffield case earlier. \nThis still present us with a potential timing issue for the transfer which Board need \nto be aware of. \n \nIt is proposed that staff will be consulted as part of the TUPE process in February, \nwith other Provider Services staff, and that the transfer will be actioned on              \n1 April 2011. However, the transfer will be subject to CCP approval.  \n \nWe are currently working on an Alternative Provider of Medical Services (APMS) \ncontract for these services. The contract will include key performance indicators \nwhich we anticipate will be broadly the same as the new Personal Medical Services \n(PMS) contract. This will ensure that the practices in these services will be in line \nwith other practices in the city. \n \nThere is a substantial amount of work to do between now and the transfer date in \nrelation to this service and timescales will need to be closely monitored. Board will \nbe kept updated on progress.  \n \n6 Shadow Partnership Boards \n \nThe shadow Partnership Boards for both adult and children?s services have been \nestablished. These Boards will lead and drive the system changes in the provision \nof community services. To enable the boards to function effectively a review of the \nlonger term governance arrangements for the Partnership Boards has been \ncommissioned. Finnamores have led this work and have suggested a range of \noptions which board members are considering.  \n4\n \nNHS Sheffield is the Sheffield Primary Care Trust  \n Following the January 2011 NHS Sheffield Board concerns were expressed that \nthe short term requirement of making transition happen will delay and potentially \nundermine the prospects for real transformation.  It was agreed that assurances \nwould be sought from the Shadow Partnership Boards in this respect. In response \nto these concerns the Children?s Shadow Partnership Board and Sheffield \nTeaching Hospital Foundation Trust (STHFT) on behalf of the shadow Adult \nPartnership Board have submitted information on how they want to assure NHS \nSheffield Board of their intention to use the opportunities and vision for the \ntransformation of service. These are attached at Appendix 1 and 2. The submission \nfrom Children?s has been developed jointly by Partnership Board members. The \nsubmission regarding adult services is based on that originally produced by the \nAdult Partnership Board but due to timing of our board papers has been updated by \ncolleagues at STHFT. It is anticipated that this vision will be further refined in \nconsultation to Partnership Board colleagues. Both Partnership Boards recognise \nthe significant transactional agenda which is necessary to ensure safe services and \nbusiness continuity from 1 April whilst setting out a clear vision for the longer term \ntransformational change across acute and community services.  \n \n7 Project Plan \n \nAs reported at the last Board, the overall status for the project has now been rated \nas red by both the Shadow Partnership Boards. The main reasons for this status \nare that there are significant concerns in relation to resolution of the issues listed in \nSchedule 4 of the Heads of Agreement. These relate to funding levels, staffing and \ncapital assets. This could have a knock on effect in relation to papers being taken \nto the respective foundation trust boards for approval. This milestone is also RAG \nrated red at this time. \n \nDespite the concerns noted above, it remains possible to achieve the April deadline \nand considerable work is ongoing. The TUPE transfer of most provider services \nstaff is expected to be straight forward. In the last two weeks substantial progress \nhas been made in relation to the staff transfer issues for support staff where there \nis no clear TUPE transfer to an individual foundation trust. A joint meeting between \nHR leads and Directors of Finance on 21 January 2011 was able to move this \nprocess forward significantly and we remain on track to allow staff affected by the \ntransfer to receive letters at the beginning of February.  \n \nSubstantial progress has also been made in the last week in terms of the financial \nrisk issues and contract negotiations, with NHS Sheffield making updated offers to \neach of the Foundation Trusts. At the time of writing this report, each of the \nFoundation Trusts are considering these proposals and undertaking further risk \nassessment work particularly with regard to the proposed cost improvement plans \nneeded to support delivery of the 4% tariff efficiency requirement in 2011/12 and a \nsustainable financial position. A verbal update can be provided at the Board. \n \nNationally the Department of Health continues to indicate that PCT?s may not \ntransfer capital assets in the sense of buildings/estate as part of TCS arrangements \nand hence we are locally working through the arrangements which will be needed \nto sub let or offer licences for occupation by the three FTs and also the associated \nfacilities management arrangements. NHS Sheffield has put forward a proposal \nwhich the three trusts are now considering. The Department of Health has also not \n5\n \nNHS Sheffield is the Sheffield Primary Care Trust formally confirmed the position in relation to the transfer of other assets such as IT \nequipment but we are locally working on a solution which assumes that such \ntransfers will be allowed. \n \n8 Formal agreement of the Transformation of Community Services \n \nAt Board meetings in 2010 members were presented with the eight national and \nour local tests against which to assess proposals around transforming community \nservices. The proposals for the transformation, as described in previous papers, fit \nwith these tests. As described in Appendix 1 and 2 attached, the partnership \nboards will improve outcomes and quality, service integration, efficiencies, \ninfrastructure utilisation, sustainability and whole system fit. These were all key \nprinciples which underpin the proposals and fit with the national and local tests.  \nThis work has been completed with comprehensive stakeholder engagement.  \n \nNoting the above, NHS Sheffield Board is asked to agree that the services currently \nprovided by Sheffield PCT Provider Services be transferred to Sheffield Teaching \nHospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield Children?s NHS Foundation Trust and \nSheffield Health and Social Care NHS Foundation Trust as detailed in Appendix 3 \nThis agreement is subject to the respective foundation trust getting approval from \ntheir respective Board or Investment Committee for the transfer.  \n \n9 Timescales \n \nThe timescales for the project have always been challenging. The slight delay in \nsigning off the Heads of Agreement has moved some of the timelines.

Members have agreed that \nthe opportunities brought about by Transferring Community Services will be used to drive \nmeasurable improvement in the health of the younger age population, and that all partner \norganisations will commit to collaborating to achieve real change. This paper sets out the \nmain aims of the strategy we are setting out to achieve, along with details of some of the \ntangible improvements we will aspire to deliver. \n \n1. VISION ? WHAT ARE WE SEEKING TO ACHIEVE? \n \nThe overarching strategy for community health services for children should focus on \nprevention, early intervention and local delivery of care, provided within effective and \nintegrated models of service delivery. Specifically, the main goals would be as follows: \n \n? To keep Sheffield?s children healthy, to help them achieve their potential, and live \ntheir lives to the full. \n \n? To make measurable improvement  to the health of the children living in the city \n \n? To provide integrated, joined up and seamless services that are easy to navigate \nfor children, young people, carers and professionals.  \n \n? To provide a service that joins together to meet the needs of the child when they \nneed it, in a place as close to home as possible, that works in partnership to ensure \nsmooth transition, avoid duplication and ensures that every child has the \nopportunity to live life to the full.  \n \n? To provide a service that aims to keep children out of hospital and other ?high tier? \ncare by addressing their needs as soon as possible, as locally as possible, \nfocussing on prevention and public health. \n \n? To provide a service that is affordable, demonstrates value for money, is \nsustainable and flexible to respond to changing local needs. \n \n? To provide services for children which are staffed by a workforce who are confident \nand empowered to enable them to work flexibly and share roles to the benefit of the \nchildren in their care,  but with clarity in roles and responsibilities. \n \n? To ensure a high level of focus is given to  meeting the  needs of younger children \nand their families, to support effective child development and preventative \napproaches \n \n \n8\n  \n2. PRINCIPLES ? ?THE SHEFFIELD WAY? \n \nA number of key principles should underpin our joint approach: \n \n? We are committed to build relationships formed on trust and understanding and \nwith the focus on outcomes for the child.  \n \n? We understand and recognise the distinct value of locally-based community \nservices, and the importance and value of managing and leading these services \nfrom within the community. \n \n? We recognise that families and children interact with a range of services and that \norganisational boundaries should not impede support or delay intervention. \n \n? We recognise that good health is not just about health services and requires a \nholistic approach   which seeks to understand and meet the needs of families. \n \n? We are committed to using evidence based approaches in order to maximise the \neffectiveness of community based services for children, with a particular emphasis \non early year?s provision and services for children with long-term conditions. \n \n3.   DRAFT PROPOSALS FOR HEALTH OUTCOMES MEASURES FOR CHILDREN \n \nIt was agreed at the Sheffield Children?s Shadow Partnership Board to give a commitment \nto delivering a number of challenging or stretch targets. In setting out to work on a \nprogramme of transformation to create more integrated services to support children and \nfamilies, there was agreement that the partnership would identify the outcomes by which it \nwould judge its success.  Whilst these measures are still under development, it is \nanticipated that the performance framework would include the following: \n \nDraft outcomes measures for the Partnership Board  \n \nPROPOSED MEASURE PERFORMANCE Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 \n2010/11 target target target \n(11/12) (12/13) (13/14)  \nPrevalence of 46.7% (Q3)  50.5% 52.5% 54.5% \nbreastfeeding rate at 6-8 \nweeks from birth \nObesity in primary 18.7% 17.7% 16.2% 15% \nschool children  \nUnder 18 conception 47.3 per 1000  39 per 1000  37 per 1000  36 per \nrate 15-17 years 15-17 years 15-17 years 1000 \n15-17 \nyears \nLow birth weight rate 7.5%    5% \n \nSmoking status at 13.6%   10% \ndelivery \n \nIn addition to those listed above, further consideration will be given to setting challenging \ntargets for improvement in the following: \n9\n  \n? Vaccination and immunisation rates ? based on geographical areas \n? Infant mortality \n? A&E attendance rate for under 5?s \n? Emergency admissions rate to hospital for under 5?s \n? CAMHS outcomes measure \n \n 3.  OPPORTUNITIES \n \nThe proposal to form a Partnership Board for Children offers the opportunity to take \nforward key service improvements and developments to services for children in a \ncohesive way. Through a partnership approach a number of significant improvement \nfor children?s services are possible over the next three years (April 2011 to March \n2014). Key themes and priorities are given below: \n \n? Providing joined up services for  disabled children with complex needs with  a key \nworker to co-ordinate care and services provided where possible in one-stop shops \n? Ensuring that good communication exists between staff with effective co-working \nand with a reduction in duplication and effective use of resources. \n? Strengthen child and carer voice in all services. \n? Complete implementation of health visiting specification. \n? Information sharing strategy to become intrinsic to proactive. \n? Developing a clear model of universal provision starting from pre-birth and \nencompassing positive parenting. \n?  Improved access to dental care \n? Community services accessible to families in community centre and schools. \n? Preventative models at all stages including consistent health promotion. \n? Improved communication and links between all agencies ? health, social care and \neducation. \n? Integrated training and development for the children?s workforce. \n? Reduced hospital admission. \n? Better early intervention ? faster connections and right service with less duplication. \n \n4. DRIVERS FOR CHANGE IN 2011 \n \nOver recent years there have been many changes to the provision of community services \nfor children, including the development of integrated practice and management. Primarily \nthis has involved staff and services provided by Sheffield City Council and those provided \nby the Sheffield PCT.  Good progress has been made however it is now timely that \npartners now work together to determine a new vision for the future and ensure that \nresources are used with maximum effectiveness to meet the needs of children in \nSheffield.  The specific drivers for change at this time are as follows: \n \n? NHS Sheffield?s withdrawal from direct provision of community health services for \nchildren in response to the nationally driven Transforming Community Services \nagenda. \n? Shared priority across commissioners and providers to reduce hospital admissions \n? Reduced funding in all areas  \n? Shared priority to improve health services for children in their early years \n? New commissioning priorities and service specifications (Achieving Balanced Health 4) \n10\n ? The new White Paper ?Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS? emphasises the \nimportance of developing personalised, effective services with an emphasis on \npreventative approaches. \n \n5.

This will result in fewer services being provided \nthrough a hospital location, which in time will result in reduced hospital \ninfrastructure with resources being transferred into community settings,.   \n \nIn order to deliver patient benefits and a sustainable and affordable healthcare \nsystem in Sheffield, the transformation process will not only include Provider Arm \nclinical services transferring to STH but also services currently provided by STH. \n \nSTH plan to deliver this ambition by successfully and safely transferring services \nfrom the Provider arm to STH by 31 March 2011, and this is taking the majority of \ntime and resource at the moment. For the first six months following transfer, the \nprocess of reviewing service transformation options and putting in place an \nimplementation plan will take place. During this time projects that have already \ncommenced will be continued and completed, and where agreed, newly emerging \nplans will start to be implemented. The main transformational programme will start \nonce the transfer has been successfully completed and in any event no later than \n01 September 2011.  \n \nVision \nTo meet the health and social care needs of citizens more effectively through an \nintegrated health and social care service in Sheffield.     \n \nWe will achieve this by;  \n1.1 Working with partners to develop an integrated health and social care \nstrategy for the City. \n1.2 Developing local standards that patients and citizens can expect from the \nnewly integrated health and social care services.   \n1.3 Addressing service inequalities across the city.  \n1.4 Personalising service packages that focus on preventing illness or the \ndeterioration of health, including promoting the role of self-care and self-\nmanagement. \n1.5 Providing alternative options to hospital care, helping to avoid current \ninappropriate yet necessary hospital admission. \n1.6 Improving the patient and citizen experience. \n1.7 Delivering better value for money.  \n1.8 Need to add in something explicitly about safety, effectiveness, quality... \n \n2 Benefits \nBoth clinical and non-clinical savings and efficiencies will result in better patient \ncare and economic savings. These will be quantified where possible during the \ntransfer and transitional periods, but at this stage in the process it is difficult to \nquantify these benefits.   \n \n2.1 Benefits for Patients \nA recent Interqual audit concluded that patients were admitted more \nfrequently to hospital and stayed longer after the completion of their acute \nepisode due, amongst other things, to insufficient or absent community \n15\n based alternatives to hospital. In some cases community based services are \nduplicated by the acute services ?out-reaching? into the community and \ncommunity based service teams, and evidence indicated that delays exist for \npatients where they have to cross from one service provider to another. The \ntransformational programme offers real opportunities to focus on delivering \npatient benefits by; \n2.1.1 supporting them on their journey through the health and social care \nsystem \n2.1.2 reducing the time taken waiting for the next stage of treatment \n2.1.3 standardising on evidence based pathways of care to deliver \nconsistently better outcomes \n2.1.4 increasing patient and carer engagement in shaping personalised \ncare packages \n2.1.5 avoiding unnecessary admission to hospital \n2.1.6 minimising length of hospital stay \n2.1.7 improve the safety and quality of services overall \n2.1.8 reducing the burden that duplication puts on patients and their \nfamilies \n2.1.9 providing balanced, equally accessible community and home based \nservices across the City  \n2.1.10 improving the patient and carer experience  \n2.1.11 improving the cost effectiveness of services and the value for money \nthey offer. \n \n2.2 Clinical Transformation \n \nIntegrating services will help to ensure a holistic approach to patient care. By \nbringing together the resources of primary care, acute services, relevant \nmental health services, Social care and community health services, the \nfocus can be on meeting  local needs in the most co-ordinated and efficient \nmanner to ensure best outcomes, maximising support whilst eliminating \nduplication and streamlining the transition between services to improve the \npatient experience.   In the medium term, this could mean integrating the \ncommunity teams for older people with the Community Care Teams and \nwhere possible moving to ensure professional co-location.  \nCare pathway redesign should facilitate personalised care and choice and \nthe integration of care pathways is also likely to result in the following \nbenefits; \n? Fewer handoffs between organisations with more streamlined \npathways; \n? Potential for the creation of Single Points of Access and assessment \nfor patients with social care and community services needs; \n? Fewer hospital admissions through the delivery of integrated \nhealthcare with community support; \n? Reduction on length of stay through the integration of social care and \ncommunity services allowing patients to be cared for outside the \nacute hospital setting. This could be enabled by an integrated \ndischarge planning system which would target those specialties with \nlong or higher than average LOS and those that interface with \ncommunity care; \n? Avoidance of emergency readmissions, linked into the LOS initiative \nabove; \n16\n ? Reduction in delayed transfers of care \n? Integration of health records. \n? The delivery of a better, integrated pathway would also allow for \nbetter management and control of intermediate healthcare which will \nassist the Trust in the management of the number of beds at the Trust \nand length of stay potentially leading to the closure of wards or the \ndiversion of resources to other essential areas.  \n \nResultant savings  are likely to be in the following areas: \n? Reduction in length of stay; \n? Reduction in delayed transfers of care; \n? Reduction in readmissions; \n? Reduction in GP referrals to acute trust with greater use of community \nteams and facilities; \n? Reduction in A&E attendances; \n? Reduction in duplication of work; \n? Reduction in patient transfers; and \n? Improvement in numbers of District Nurse contacts per day. \n \n2.3 Rationalisation of management structures and governance \nCurrently, services are delivered by two separate organisations with two \nseparate boards and governance structures. The integration of services \nwould allow the rationalisation of management and governance \narrangements. The aim will be to create a more integrated management \nstructure with efficiencies being achieved in management costs.  \n \n2.4 Estates rationalisation \nAlthough property will not transfer to STH, there may be opportunities to \nrelease savings in the property portfolio through improved utilisation of \nestate with the consequent release of leased property.  \n \n2.5 Back Office shared services \nThrough the integration of the two organisations it should be possible to \ncreate a shared back office function providing IT, HR and Finance and other \ncorporate/support services, such as procurement.  \n \n2.6 Procurement Savings \nIt is likely that by integration of the procurement processes greater scale \nefficiencies can be achieved.  \n \n2.7 Human Resources \n \nThe removal of organisational boundaries positively impacts on: \n? The establishment of clear and more effective communication lines; \n? Single entry point for services and personalised case management of \nhigh risk patients improves patient outcomes, their experience and \nstaff morale. \n17\n ? The inclusion of the ?right? people with the ?right? skills thus delivering \na joined up service across both the community and acute settings to \nprovide an integrated service; \n? Joint education, training and development allows staff to work \ntogether sharing knowledge and experience; and \n? Users ? both internal and external ? have access to an enhanced \nshared knowledge base. \n \n3 Current transformation projects  \n \nA number of transformational projects are underway that are planning to transform \nservices and deliver patient benefits; \n \n3.1 Diabetes \nServices are being transformed so that more patients with type two diabetes \nhave better access to community and primary care diabetes services, led \nand fully supported by STH senior consultants. \n \n3.2 Heart Failure \nThe adult provider partnership board is supporting a short term review of the \nheart failure service aimed at integrating the two service provision teams and \nchanging the focus of the service to be community facing. \n \n3.3 Hospital Admission avoidance \nProjects are underway with secondary, community and primary care \ninvolvement to establish a GP assessment unit and improve the \nmanagement of people with dementia. The purpose of these two projects is \nto provide alternatives to accident and emergency and so reduce the \nnumber of people attending the department. \n \n3.4 Hospital Discharge \nThis comprises a number of projects with community, social services and \nprimary care involvement to speed up the discharge process. The projects \ncurrently underway are; \n? Home of choice \n? Improved discharge planning processes \n? Improved access to intermediate care \n \nThis group of projects aim to reduce the demand for non-elective beds by \nimproving community services that integrate with hospital based services. \nThe result will be a reduction in the number of hospital beds and \nreinvestment in community services. \n \nIn essence the proposals all consolidate into an integrated plan for winter \nand beyond aims to put new systems and process in place to reduce the \nnumber of people being admitted to hospital and rapidly discharges them \nback to their own homes or communities after the acute episode.  \n \n4 Governance \nThe adult provider partnership board APPB, will be the group that works with \ncommissioners to interpret commissioning intentions and produce practical \nsolutions to deliver the desired commissioning outputs. The APPB will establish \n18\n cross cutting project groups to tackle the barriers to achieving integrated care and \ndeveloping integrated care pathways and act as the delivery board, ensuring that \nplans are being implemented according to timetable and delivering the anticipated \nbenefits. \n \n5 Conclusions \nSTH is committed to transforming healthcare in Sheffield, not just community \nservices transferring from the Provider Arm. The Chief Executive has set out his \nvision for the transformation in several public meetings and the Board at STH \nsupport the need to transform the way services are provided to achieve stable and \naffordable services. However, the safe transfer of services by 31 March and a \nsmooth transition period prior to the transformational programme is also needed. \nEvidence from pilots indicates that the most successful transformations occur \nwhere patients and service providers design and implement new pathways. STH is \nfully committed to these principles. \n19\n Appendix 3 \n \nServices currently provided by Sheffield PCT Provider Services and Proposed Transfer to Respective NHS Foundation Trust \n \nSheffield Teaching Hospital NHS FT Sheffield Children's NHS FT Sheffield Health and Social Care NHS FT \nAdmissions Avoidance/Interface Services Child Health Brain Injury \nCare Home Support Children's Speech and Language Therapy CFSME \nCase Managers Family Nurse Partnership IAPT \nCentre for HIV  Health Visiting Primary Care Mental Health \nCommunity Podiatry Health Visiting Liaison Neuro Enablement Service \nCommunity Matrons Looked After Children PCT Managed Practices \nContinence Service Safeguarding Children Service SCAIS \nContraception and Sexual Health Service  School Nursing Speech and Language Therapy and \nPhysiotherapy (mental health/learning \ndisabilities) \nSheffield Salaried Primary Dental Service Sure Start  Homeless and Travellers Service \nDietetics including: Weigh Ahead    \nDistrict Nursing   \nDomiciliary Physiotherapy   \nEvening/Nights and Weekend Nursing   \nGP Collaborative   \nIntensive Home Nursing   \nIntermediate Care   \nLymphoedema Service   \nMental Health Support for Case \nManagement   \nPhlebotomy Service   \nPhysioWorks Musculoskeletal, Foot and \nAnkle Service   \nPhysioPlus (formerly PhysioWorks for staff)   \nPhysiotherapy including: Falls and \nRehabilitation   \nPrimary Care Addiction Services (PCASS)   \n20 \n Pulmonary and Cardiac Rehabilitation   \nReferral Information Service   \nSingle Point of Access   \nSpecialist Nurses including: Respiratory, \nHeart Failure, COPD   \nSpecialist Podiatry including (Podiatric \nSurgery)   \nSpeech and Language Therapy Adults    \nTissue Viability   \nTuberculosis Service   \nWalk-in Centre   \n \nNB It is proposed that the contracts of those staff working in corporate and support services will be transferred to one of the \nthree Foundation Trusts, however, final details are yet to be resolved \n21 \n \n",

Our strategic vision for the â??Sharing Library Services Programmeâ?? is toÂ enable access to the collective resources and services of a virtual academic library for Wales.\n\nOur ambition is that the Programme will have direct impacts on individual learners and/or citizens, learning institutions and Wales as a vibrant knowledge economy;\n\n\tIndividuals will be able to exploit the shared services delivered directly to them,\n\tlearning institutions (across the sectoral boundaries) will find it easier to collaborate for learning, teaching and research and\n\tWales will have a visible platform for access to knowledge within & to Welsh businesses as well as showcasing the knowledge created in Wales to economic and political partners.\n\n\nLike this:\nLike\nBe the first to like this.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis entry was posted in shared services and tagged CyMAL, shared services.

It made for an interesting alternative podcast listen on my dog-walk today. He discussed the high-intensity exercise regime he tried for Horizon last year, the ambiguity about alcohol units and whether smoothies and fruit juice count towards your ?5-a-day?.\n\nIn summary, ?\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n \nFive major challenges to avoid food crunch\n\n\t\t\tPosted at 9:00 am by David Bradley \n\t\t\t?\nGrowing population and an increasing poverty gap are major challenges for global food security especially when the issue of biofuels produced from crops is introduced. According to Tahereh Alavi Hojjat of DeSales University, in Center Valley, Pennsylvania, USA, governments around the world must address five major challenges if we are not to see an enormous increase in human suffering, disease and starvation:\n\n1 Energy security ?

(WAQ57028) \n \nNi ddarparwyd cyfieithiad \n \nThe recommendations of the Pennington Inquiry can be found at : \n \nhttp://wales.gov.uk/ecoliinquiry/?lang=en \n \nOnly recommendations and 3, 16, 18 and 20 require action by the Welsh Assembly Government; progress \nis described below. \n \nRecommendation 3 - Additional resources should be made available to ensure that all food businesses in \nWales understand and use the HACCP (Hazard Analysis, Critical Control Point) approach and have in \nplace an effective, documented, food safety management system which is embedded in working culture \nand practice. \n \nI have asked the Food Standards Agency (FSA) to review food law enforcement procedures and \nstructures in Wales.  The findings of this review will enable me to consider future resourcing options. \n \n \nRecommendation 16 - Businesses contracting for the supply of high-risk foods, such as raw and cooked \nmeats, to public sector organisations must be subject to independent food hygiene audits. \n \nFrom September 2009 there has been a public sector framework agreement with a private company for \nthe provision of third party hygiene audits.  The Welsh Assembly Government strongly encourages \ncontracting authorities to follow this recommendation. \nValue Wales has also produced a ’ best practice 'framework' of food guidance for use by the public sector \nin Wales.  This aims to provide a structured approach to food procurement and has been developed in \nconjunction with the Food Standards Agency, WLGA, Trading Standards, other WAG departments and \nthe Value Wales Food Group. \nThe framework has been endorsed by the Chief Medical Officer, WLGA, FSA and Director General of \nHealth & Social Services for Wales.   \n \n \nRecommendation 18 - Every local authority should have a programme of audits to ensure that all schools \nhave adequate toilet and hand washing facilities. \n \nStatutory responsibility for the provision of adequate school toilet facilities rests with local authorities.  \nNot withstanding this, WAG is to issue good practice guidance to assist School Governing Bodies, Head \nTeachers and Local Authorities.  \n \nA Stakeholder Steering Group has helped develop the guidance and the Consultation on the Best Practise \nGuidance on standards for school toilets was published in November 2010.  The consultation period \nended on 24 January 2011 and included consulting with children and young people through the Pupil \nVoice Wales website and networks. Officials are now collating the responses and developing an action \nplan prior to the publication of the final guidance. \n \n \n 2 Atebion a roddwyd i Gwestiynau Ysgrifenedig y Cynulliad i’w hateb ar 3 Chwefror 2011 \n \nRecommendation 20 - The National Assembly for Wales should consider my recommendations and \nmonitor and report progress on implementation. \n \nOn 7 July 2009, in plenary session, the then First Minister committed to reporting to the Assembly in 1 \nyear and regularly thereafter.  The Chief Medical Officer has agreed to act as the Welsh Assembly \nGovernment (WAG) ‘point of contact’ for the provision of updates to the First Minister and the Minister \nfor Heath and Social Services.  I reported to the Assembly in October 2010. \n \nThe Welsh Assembly Government will continue to monitor progress through routine reporting channels \nand with specific discussions when appropriate.  \n \n \nI also refer you to the independent report published by Consumer Focus Wales in March 2010 at: \nhttp://www.consumerfocus.org.uk/wales/publications/protecting-consumers-from-e-coli-o157 \nAn updated report will be published by CFW in March 2011.   \n \n \n \nGofyn i’r Gweinidog dros Blant, Addysg a Dysgu Gydol Oes \n \nNick Bourne (Canolbarth a Gorllewin Cymru): A wnaiff y Gweinidog egluro pam mae ei bolisïau'n \nmethu gwella safonau yn ysgolion Cymru yn ôl y ffigurau diweddaraf gan y Sefydliad ar gyfer \nCydweithrediad a Datblygiad Economaidd. (WAQ57031) \n \nNi ddarparwyd cyfieithiad \n \nI have acknowledged that Wales’ results in PISA 2009 are extremely disappointing.  Whilst results within \nWales have improved overall, there is clear evidence that, comparatively within the UK and \ninternationally, the system is failing to consistently deliver good outcomes for our young people. \nMy written statement on 2 February outlined the next steps I intend to take to drive up improvements \nthroughout the education system. \n \n \nNick Bourne (Canolbarth a Gorllewin Cymru): A wnaiff y Gweinidog egluro pa agweddau ar ei \nbolisïau sydd wedi arwain at y methiant mewn safonau academaidd a amlygwyd gan Estyn yn ei \nadroddiad a gyhoeddwyd ddydd Mawrth 25 Ionawr 2011. (WAQ57032)  \n \nNi ddarparwyd cyfieithiad \n \nMy written statement on 2 February provided an outline of how we will tackle the challenges to drive up \nimprovement across the education sector. \n \n \nDai Lloyd (Gorllewin De Cymru): A wnaiff y Gweinidog ddatganiad am ohirio Cyfran 3 y Grantiau \nGwella Adeiladau Ysgolion a Band A cyllid Ysgolion ar gyfer yr 21ain Ganrif am y 12 mis nesaf. \n(WAQ57039) \n \nNi ddarparwyd cyfieithiad \n \nThe Tranche 3 funding was announced in July 2010. The 13 projects `approved in principle’ indicated \nthat spending would start in 2011-2012.  Following the budget announcement in November 2010 and the \nsignificant impact on capital budgets there is a need to manage these within the funding envelope \navailable.  My officials are therefore working with Local Authorities (LAs) in order to ensure that the \nAssembly Government funding is made available at the right time, in line with the delivery of all projects.  \nThis may result in some projects starting at different times. \n 3 Atebion a roddwyd i Gwestiynau Ysgrifenedig y Cynulliad i’w hateb ar 3 Chwefror 2011 \n \nLocal Authorities submitted their 21st Century Schools Strategic Outline Programmes on 10th December \n2010.  These will now be assessed through a robust evaluation process, with an announcement in Summer \n2011.   \n \n \n \nGofyn i’r Gweinidog dros yr Economi a Thrafnidiaeth \n \nMick Bates (Sir Drefaldwyn): Pwy fydd ar y panel arbenigol o arbenigwyr diwydiant a benodir i \nddarparu cyngor yng nghyswllt Rhaglen Adfywio'r Economi. (WAQ57037) \n \nNi ddarparwyd cyfieithiad \n \nThe Creative Sector Panel has been in place since October 2010, and I announced details of the \nmembership in a Written Cabinet Statement on 11 October 2010.  Membership of the remaining five \nSector Panels is subject to the formal Public Appointments process.  Interviews have been carried out and \nrecommendations for appointments made.  Once the successful candidates have accepted their \nappointments I will be in a position to issue a Written Cabinet Statement with full details of the Panel \nmembers and their backgrounds. \n \n \n \nGofyn i’r Gweinidog dros Iechyd a Gwasanaethau Cymdeithasol \n \nDai Lloyd (Gorllewin De Cymru): A wnaiff y Gweinidog ddatganiad am barhad posibl system \nannibynnol sy'n delio â chwynion i'r GIG ar ôl methu datrys y mater yn lleol. (WAQ57038) \n \nNi ddarparwyd cyfieithiad \n \nI have taken the view that patients and staff will be better served by a more thorough and responsive \nprocess which seeks to resolve concerns as quickly as possible locally and which builds in elements of \nindependence, for example, securing expert clinical advice, at those earlier stages.   \nUnder the arrangements I propose to bring into effect from 1 April, investment is being made in building \nskills and capacity locally to enable better handling of concerns.     \n \n \n \nGofyn i'r Gweinidog dros Faterion Gwledig  \n \nBrynle Williams (Gogledd Cymru): A wnaiff y Gweinidog ddarparu manylion costau, hyd yn hyn, y \ngwaith i reoli Phytophthora Ramorum yng Nghymru. (WAQ57033) \n \nNi ddarparwyd cyfieithiad \n \nCosts to date in respect of Phytophthora ramorum clearance are:  \n  \n£61,686 clearance of young crops   \n£78,049 ground surveying and sampling  \n£34,725 aerial surveying \n£1,000 to the private sector for assistance with agent’s fees. \n£586,080 over a period of 12 weeks on plant hire  \n£76,000 civil engineering costs \n \nIn addition, associated staff costs to date are £19,166.  \n \n 4 Atebion a roddwyd i Gwestiynau Ysgrifenedig y Cynulliad i’w hateb ar 3 Chwefror 2011 \n \nBrynle Williams (Gogledd Cymru): Hyd yn hyn, beth fu a) costau gweithredol yr adolygiad parhaus o \nfiwrocratiaeth ar y fferm, ac b) yr arbedion ariannol sydd wedi cael eu cyflawni gan yr adolygiad. \n(WAQ57034) \n \nNi ddarparwyd cyfieithiad \n \nI refer you to the response I provided to WAQ 56082 (June 2010) which detailed costs totaling £2,626. In \nJanuary of this year, two of my officials and Peredur Hughes, external advisor to the review, met with \nRichard Macdonald in London to discuss the DEFRA Farm Regulation Review and its linkages with our \nown review. The total operational costs of the ongoing review of on-farm red tape now stand at \n£2,762.50. \nThe objectives of the Red Tape Review is to rationalize and reduce where possible bureaucracy for \nfarmers and to improve communications with the industry. I do not have, and will not be able to obtain \nwithout a significant administrative overhead and financial cost, a figure for the financial savings that \nhave been achieved on behalf of the industry and/or individual farmers in Wales.  \n \n \nBrynle Williams (Gogledd Cymru): Pa drafodaethau y mae'r Gweinidog neu ei swyddogion wedi'u cael \ngyda chynrychiolwyr awdurdodau lleol ynghylch gwaredu daliadau amaethyddol cynghorau. \n(WAQ57035) \n \nNi ddarparwyd cyfieithiad \n \nMy officials have been in contact with local authorities to re-establish the Annual Report on Local \nAuthority Smallholdings in Wales, which provides data on the disposal of local authority agricultural \nholdings. The 09/10 report, to which all local authorities contributed, was laid before the Assembly on 23 \nDecember 2010.  While caution must be exercised when measuring minor differences and establishing \ntrends  within such a small demographic, the continuation of the report will allow more accurate statistics \nto be collated and so present future trends to a higher degree of certainty.   \n \nI will be providing a response to the recommendations of the Rural Development Sub-committee Inquiry \ninto Local Authority Farms on the 7th February, which will include consideration of the the disposal of \nestate assets by local authorities. \n \n \nBrynle Williams (Gogledd Cymru): A wnaiff y Gweinidog ddarparu dadansoddiad o'r derbyniadau a \nddisgwylir gan ffermydd gwynt ar ystad y comisiwn coedwigaeth yn ystod pob blwyddyn o'u bywyd \ngweithredol.

INTRODUCTION \n \nThis paper sets out the governance and accountability framework that the PCT has \ndeveloped in order to support GP practices and the GP Consortium to commission \nservices on behalf of their practice populations. \n \nPractice Based Commissioning will provide the following incentives for practices to \nimprove and develop patient care in Primary and Community based settings.  \n \nnull To establish clinicians at the heart of the commissioning and service redesign. \n \nnull To realise a real shift of focus to primary care delivery, through the utilisation of \nresources released through referral management and Payment by Results, into \nother local models of care. \n \nnull To enable practices and localities to secure a wide range of services, including \nthe development of primary care based services and services to support patients \nin self management of their health. \n \nnull To enable the commissioning of integrated care pathways. \n \nnull To enable practices to support people with long term conditions through \ninvestment in packages of community based care. \n \nnull To use the experience gained by practices in the management of prescribing \nbudgets to ensure the efficient use of existing resources. \n \n2. PRACTICE BASED COMMISSIONING GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  \n \nThis framework recognises the important role that practices should play in \ncommissioning services for their patients and local populations and also sets out the \nparameters within the local heath system in which this will take place. \n \nThe Framework for 2007-08 contains the following sections: \n \n? Corporate governance arrangements \n? The agreed local vision that Practice Based Commissioning will seek to achieve \n? The arrangements to develop and support sustainable clinical engagement \n? Roles and responsibilities of the PCT \n 3\nPractice Based Commissioning Governance Framework and Locally Enhanced Service Proposal.  \nWestern Cheshire Primary Care Trust Board Meeting \nth\n28 March 2007                          AGENDA ITEM NO. 2006/07/66   \n? Roles and responsibilities of the practices \n? Finance and information \n? Business planning process and practice agreements \n? Public and patient involvement \n? Managing the potential conflict of practice commissioner and provider roles \n? Local dispute resolution process \n \n2.1 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ARRANGEMENTS \n \nThe PCT Practice Based Commissioning Governance Framework has been developed \nto support the PCT?s statutory duty of: \n \n? Being accountable for all funds allocated to it by the Secretary of State and \nfor ensuring fair access to high quality services for its population, within its \nresource allocation; and \n? Involving and consulting patients and the public when considering new or \ndifferent service provision \n \n?Corporate governance? is the system by which an organisation is directed and \ncontrolled, at its most senior levels, in order to achieve its objectives and meet the \nnecessary standards of accountability and probity.  \n \nEffective corporate governance, along with clinical governance, is essential to achieve \nclinical, quality and financial objectives. Fundamental to effective corporate governance \nis having the means to verify the effectiveness of this direction and control. \n \nThe PCT Corporate Governance Framework currently requires compliance, by the PCT \nnon-officer members, Board and Executive Committee members, officers and \nemployees of the PCT, with the following key documents: \n \n? The accountable officer memorandum \n? The Codes of Conduct and Accountability issued by the Department of Health \n? Standing Orders as a framework for internal governance \n? Standing Financial Instructions as a framework for Financial  \n Governance \n \nUnder this PCT Practice Based Commissioning Governance Framework, practices will \nalso be required to comply with the above documents in order to ensure that the PCT \nremains compliant with its assurance framework responsibilities.  \n \nIn particular the Consortium or Practice Agreement will set out the terms under which \npractices are required to undertake their commissioning role. \n \n2.1.1 The Role of the Board \n \nThe PCT Board will remain responsible for ensuring that this framework is robust in \nterms of meeting the PCT?s Corporate Governance responsibilities. \n \nThe Framework will be underpinned by the business planning process, Consortium or \nPractice agreements and performance monitoring arrangements. \n \n 4\nPractice Based Commissioning Governance Framework and Locally Enhanced Service Proposal.  \nWestern Cheshire Primary Care Trust Board Meeting \nth\n28 March 2007                          AGENDA ITEM NO. 2006/07/66   \nThe Board will consider recommendations from the PEC through the Integrated \nGovernance Committee before ratifying any budgets for 2007-08 or business plans.  \n \nThe Board must be assured that potential conflicts of interest are addressed, when for \nexample; there are circumstances where the practice commissioner is also the provider \nof the service.   \n \nThe Board plays a crucial part in ensuring that patients and the public are integrally \ninvolved in the commissioning decisions made under PBC. \n \nThe Board will receive regular progress reports in relation to the implementation of \nPractice Based Commissioning.  \n \n2.1.2 The Role of the Integrated Governance Committee \n \nThe Integrated Governance Committee will receive commissioning recommendations \nfrom the PEC and make recommendations to the Board relating to the implementation \nof the commissioning plans. \n \n2.1.3 The Role of the Professional Executive Committee \n \nThe role of the Professional Executive Committee (PEC) is pivotal to the success of \nPractice Based Commissioning.  \n \nThe PEC plays a key part of the current Corporate Governance arrangements within \nthe PCT and will therefore continue to give clinical advice to the Integrated Governance \nCommittee and Board as part of the business planning process detailed within this \nframework. \n \nThe PEC will receive regular progress reports in relation to the implementation of \nPractice Based Commissioning.  \n \n2.1.4 The Role of the Local Medical Committee (LMC) \n \nThe LMC has a role in supporting GMS and PMS practices in delivering their \nresponsibilities in line with the Practice Based Commissioning Directed Enhanced \nService.  \n \nThe LMC as a local representative committee does not have a governance role as part \nof the PCTs organisational governance structure for PbC. \n \n2.2. THE LOCAL VISION FOR PRACTICE BASED COMMISSIONING \n \nTo improve the health of the people of Western Cheshire, through; \n \n? Securing improvement in health and reducing inequalities for the local \npopulation \n? Collective responsibility for achievement of National and Local targets by \nactive engagement in effective demand management and service redesign. \n? Ensuring access to quality services. \n? Improving local access to services by providing care closer to home. \n? Developing a wider range of services more sensitive to local needs. \n? Achieving best value for money. \n 5\nPractice Based Commissioning Governance Framework and Locally Enhanced Service Proposal.  \nWestern Cheshire Primary Care Trust Board Meeting \nth\n28 March 2007                          AGENDA ITEM NO. 2006/07/66   \n? Developing services in-line with evidence based practice and new \ntechnologies. \n? Developing the workforce. \n \n2.3. DEVELOPING AND SUPPORTING SUSTAINABLE CLINICAL ENGAGEMENT \n \n2.3.1. Structure \n \nSuccessful implementation of Practice Based Commissioning can only be achieved if \nrobust structures are developed that will encourage and support local clinicians in \nbecoming actively involved in the commissioning process. \n \nThis framework seeks to achieve this by establishing arrangements that will enable all \nlocal clinicians to be part of the commissioning process, whilst recognising that there \nwill be a number of levels of engagement. \n \nThe PCT recognises that there are a number of models for the operation of Practice \nBased Commissioning. The PCT supports the national guidance and will support \nmedical practices to work together to secure improvements in health services as part of \na PCT-wide consortium. \n \n2.3.2 Wider Clinical Engagement  \n \nDuring 2007-08 PbC will build on the effective engagement of GPs and medical \npractices from the previous year. Wherever possible nurses, allied health professionals, \nsocial care workers and other independent contractors (pharmacists, dentists and \noptometrists) should be engaged in the PbC agenda. Practice based commissioners \nshould use local forums and representative committees to seek views and share \nbusiness plans. \n \n2.3.3 Summary of Options  for Practice Engagement \n \nIt is expected that all practices will take up the PbC Locally Enhanced Service (LES) in \n2007-08 and work together in a PCT-wide consortium with other practices to deliver \nPractice Based Commissioning, including the production of a single PCT-wide PbC \nplan. The LES payment will support the locality or consortia. The PCT will provide all \npractices with an indicative budget and feedback on its management of that budget, \nand the monthly information pack from the PCT on its use of resources. \n \nIf an individual practice chooses not to take up the PbC LES the commissioning of \nservices for the patients of the practice will be carried out by the PCT or by the PCT-\nwide consortia. The PCT will still inform the practice of its indicative budget and provide \nthe practice with a monthly information pack on its use of resources. \n \n2.4. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PCT \n \nUnder the terms of this framework the PCT will have the following roles and \nresponsibilities: \n \n? Involve local clinicians in setting a clear vision and strategy which achieves local \nand national targets as part of the Commissioning Prospectus and Local \nDelivery Planning cycles. \n 6\nPractice Based Commissioning Governance Framework and Locally Enhanced Service Proposal.  \nWestern Cheshire Primary Care Trust Board Meeting \nth\n28 March 2007                          AGENDA ITEM NO. 2006/07/66   \n? Executive Directors of the PCT will retain delegated responsibility of the Board to \nachieve financial balance and manage financial risk. \n? Provide the infrastructure to support Practice Based Commissioning \n? Undertake a training needs analysis of practices to support their commissioning \nrole and facilitate the appropriate training and development  \n? Provide practices with monthly financial and activity information including \nbenchmarked data with other practices within the PCT area and with the national \naverage \n? Provide Public Health data to support commissioning \n? Support practice based commissioners in active engagement with the patients, \nthe public and wider stakeholders in service redesign and the re-allocation of \nfreed up resources \n? Approve practice business plans \n? Continue to commission those services outside the Consortium commissioning \nplan on behalf of GP practices. \n? Be responsible for the procurement of services through the preparation, \nnegotiation, agreement and management of contracts/SLAs \n? Performance manage Practice/locality SLAs \n? Retain accountable body status for holding contracts/SLAs including legally \nbinding Foundation Trust contracts \n? Routinely monitor the effectiveness of PBC and share good practice between \npractice/locality within the PCT area and outside \n? Support the practices/localities in engaging with local councils and social \nservices in order to strengthen existing partnerships and support their \ncommissioning role \n? Aim to resolve any disputes through the local resolution process \n? Intervene if it is apparent that the delivery of a key national target is threatened \n? Prepare monitoring reports for the PCT Board on the implementation of Practice \nBased Commissioning. \n \n2.5. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF PRACTICES  \n \n Under the terms of this framework, practices, through the Consortium structure, have \nthe following roles and responsibilities: \n \n? Develop a business plan, with guidance from the PCT  \n? Contribute to the development of innovative ideas for service change through \nparticipation in the arrangements for clinical engagement that the PCT has \nestablished \n? Contribute to the management of demand for secondary care services \n? Review the activity and financial information provided by the PCT \n? Comply with the PCTs Corporate Governance Framework that includes \nadherence with the relevant statutory and non statutory standards \n? Commission in accordance with applicable Western Cheshire PCT \nCommissioning Policies  \n? Utilise resources responsibly to ensure financial balance \n? Ensure that patients are able to exercise Choice \n? Contribute to delivering national and local targets  \n? Ensure clinical changes do not adversely affect health inequalities within the \nPCT \n 7\nPractice Based Commissioning Governance Framework and Locally Enhanced Service Proposal.  \nWestern Cheshire Primary Care Trust Board Meeting \nth\n28 March 2007                          AGENDA ITEM NO. 2006/07/66   \n? Ensure that the quality of services commissioned or provided by practices are \nunderpinned by robust Clinical Governance arrangements and are evidenced \nbased. \n? Ensure that pre-existing service level agreements and contracts, for example, \nthose with the Independent Sector are honoured  \n? Continue to prescribe in a clinical and cost effective way and ensure adherence \nto changes in local and national prescribing policy \n? Demonstrate a commitment to wider clinical engagement as detailed under \nparagraph 2.3.2. \n \n2.6. INFORMATION AND FINANCE \n \n2.6.1 Information \n \nThe PCT will provide access to monthly information for practices during 2007-08.  \n \nThe format of the information provided will be developed with the Consortium and \npractices and an agreed version will be issued as soon as possible in 2007-08. The \nformat of potential reports will be discussed at an early stage to ensure that data \nproduced is meaningful and that an appropriate level of analysis has been undertaken. \n \nThe PCT will: \n \n? produce information to facilitate the production of business plans   \n? produce ongoing monitoring information \n? undertake basic checks to ensure that information is timely and accurate, \nworking with practices where appropriate to validate data \n? carry out analysis of the information to ensure that exceptions to trends and \noutliers are identified, at a basic level \n \nIn response practices will be expected to work with the PCT to: \n \n? review and understand the information produced \n? validate information where appropriate \n?  identify exceptions and trends \n? discuss possible reasons for the exceptions \n? judge whether changes in commissioning behaviour need to take place as a result. \n \n2.6.1.1 Validation of Information \n  \nThe validation checks carried out on the data will be documented and shared with \npractices.  \nPractices will be expected to actively participate in the validation process, and will need \nto be satisfied that the information flows that underpin the commissioning process are \nof good quality and that issues are being actively addressed. \n \nThe validation checks carried out on secondary care information by the PCT will \ninclude: \n \n? Highlighting activity variances from plan at speciality/HRG level.  \n? Where there is significant activity with no plan, discuss with Provider  \n? Checking allocation of GP practice codes  \n 8\nPractice Based Commissioning Governance Framework and Locally Enhanced Service Proposal.  \nWestern Cheshire Primary Care Trust Board Meeting \nth\n28 March 2007                          AGENDA ITEM NO. 2006/07/66   \n? Monitoring levels of uncoded episodes \n? Investigating significant changes in casemix.  \n \n2.6.1.2. Investigating Exceptions \n \nThe PCT already has routine systems in place with its main providers to raise issues \naround exceptions highlighted, data quality, timeliness of information flows, and to \nmonitor progress. \n \nFurther investigations will normally be carried out by the PCT on behalf of the \npractices/networks e.g. queries will be raised with the local Provider Units, progress \ndocumented and results reported. In some cases e.g. high cost - low volume cases, \npractices/localities may be expected to check against primary sources of information \ne.g. referral letters.  \n \nInformation queries should be directed to the PCT Knowledge Management \nDirectorate, who will investigate and report back. This system will ensure that common \nthemes are highlighted (eg several practices having a similar issues with information) \nand, in some cases, Knowledge Management Directorate staff will be able to answer \nqueries without further referral onwards.  \n \n 2.6.1.3 Benchmarking and Sharing of Information \n \nBenchmarking practice and locality information against PCT and national figures will be \nused to identify variances. Discussions at routine practice meetings will establish the \nreasons for results outside the expected range, and any further action or analysis. The \nPCT currently provides information that is practice (but not patient) identifiable. It is \nexpected that patient identifiable data will be made available in early 2007-08. \n \n2.6.1.4 Systems and Data Sources  \n \nInformation from all providers will come into the PCT for onward circulation via monthly \nreports. \n \nPractice Based Commissioning contract monitoring will use the services provided by \nthe County Information Shared Service Unit (CISSU) and by a shared data warehouse \nin the ICT shared services using the central Secondary User System (SUS) for \nsecondary care activity. \n \nActivity information at HRG level will be based on the Contract Data Sets (CDS) \nproduced by secondary care.  \n \nThe PCT will publish to practices the service level agreement it has with CISSU and the \nICT shared service in respect of the timing and quality of reports. \n \n2.6.2 Budget Setting and Financial Management \n \nThe PCT is proposing to provide indicative budgets to practices as soon as possible in \n2007-08 for the following areas of the PCT?s expenditure: \n \n? Payment by Results (PbR) activity for the major provider Trusts. \n? Mental Health services \n? Secondary care services currently outside the scope of PbR \n 9\nPractice Based Commissioning Governance Framework and Locally Enhanced Service Proposal.  \nWestern Cheshire Primary Care Trust Board Meeting \nth\n28 March 2007                          AGENDA ITEM NO. 2006/07/66   \n? Community nursing services \n? Services provided by Allied Health professionals \n? Services currently provided by other local PCTs (e.g. School Nursing) \n? Services provided by the Independent Sector \n? PDS and GDS dental services \n? Community pharmacy services \n? GP prescribing \n \nPractice Based Commissioning exclusions \n \nA number of services have been specifically excluded from the practice indicative \nbudgets, as per the latest Practice Based Commissioning Guidance, as follows: \n \n? Core GMS and PMS \n? Specialised services, services commissioned regionally and nationally and \nnational screening programmes. \n \nPbR activity for other Provider Trusts is excluded at this stage as volumes for individual \npractices are comparatively low and minor swings in referral patterns could affect \npractice budgetary performance adversely. \n \nServices commissioned by PCTs from other primary care providers (dentists, \ncommunity pharmacists and optometrists) and secondary care referrals by primary care \ndentists or optometrists cannot be changed without full consultation and the consent of \nother professionals. \n \nAllocation of budgets, including payment by Results (PbR) activity and prescribing \n \nPractice budgets for all services will be allocated to individual practices based on a \nweighted capitation (fair shares) methodology, as recommended by the Department of \nHealth. \n \n2.6.2.1 Presentation of budget information \n \nThe PCT will develop the presentation of budget information in conjunction with the \nConsortium and Practices, so that it can be presented in a concise and understandable \nformat, which will enable practices to identify variances from planned activity.  This \ninformation will be developed in parallel with the activity information pack being \nprepared by the PCT Knowledge Management Department. \n \n2.6.2.3 Financial Management  \n \nThe PCT sees financial management as a year-round process and not a year-end \nprocess.  \n \nRegular monitoring (using trigger points, referral ceilings and floors) will highlight \npotential problems early and a pro-active course of action will be agreed with any \npractices/locality indicating potential year-end overspends against the indicative \nbudgets.  \n \nWhere a practice or locality  puts forward a plan to spend more in one year to free up \nresources in future years (ie. achieve financial balance over a three-year period), the \n 10\nPractice Based Commissioning Governance Framework and Locally Enhanced Service Proposal.  \nWestern Cheshire Primary Care Trust Board Meeting \nth\n28 March 2007                          AGENDA ITEM NO. 2006/07/66   \nPCT will consider this as part of their wider financial responsibilities but the first priority \nmust be to ensure balance at year-end. \n \nA PCT-wide risk-sharing pool to handle high cost individual care or unplanned in year \nvariations in activity and cost will be established.  Department of Health guidance refers \nto a top-sliced fund of between 3% and 5% of indicative budgets.  The PCT intends to \ndevelop a list of high cost, low volume HRGs for which practices can apply to have their \nactivity funded from the risk-sharing pool.  The budget for these specific HRGs will be \ntop-sliced from individual practice budgets based on historic activity levels.  All PbR \nactivity outside of this prescribed list will be attributed to practice budgets. \n \nFreed up resources can be used by practices on premises development only with the \nspecific approval of the PCT. \n \nThe first part of the LES payment (95p per registered patient) is payable to the practice \non production of a Consortium Practice Based Commissioning plan agreed between \nthe Consortium and the PCT. This payment is to support its involvement in Practice \nBased Commissioning.  \n \nThe second part of the LES payment (a minimum of 95p per registered payment) is \npayable if the practice achieves the objectives set out in the plan, and should be paid \nfrom the resources that the plan will have released against the total indicative budget \nheld by the practice. These monies are intended for reinvestment in patient care or \nother practice activity that supports the delivery of plan objectives. \n \nIf the plan releases more resources than are needed to pay the second LES payment, \nthen the practice and Consortium would be entitled to redirect resources into services \nvia an agreed commissioning plan, for the benefits of patients for up to 70% of these \nresources. The PCT would use the remaining 30% to meet wider needs across the \nPCT area. \n \nIt is worth noting that if a practice delivers all the objectives set out in the plan agreed \nwith the PCT, but the resources freed up do not cover the second LES payment, then \nthe practice may still be entitled to the second LES payment in full. The PCT when \nagreeing plans will ensure that they are robust in identifying achievable levels of freed-\nup resources. \n \nThe Department of Health?s intention is that 30% of freed up resources should be used \nby the PCT to meet a wider health need across the whole PCT area. Where a PCT is in \ndeficit at year-end, the first call on the 30% will be to cover such overspends but only \nas a last resort. \nWhere practices free up resources above the second LES component, they can agree \nwith the PCT a greater value of freed up resources to be reinvested in patient care. \n \n2.6.2.4 Support for Practices \n \nThe first component of the LES will be payable to practices agreeing to take part in \nPbC in 2007-8 and assist the production of a Consortium commissioning plan. \n \nThe second component of the LES will, on delivery of the plan by 31 March 2008, be \npayable when the PCT year end position is determined.  \n \n \n 11\nPractice Based Commissioning Governance Framework and Locally Enhanced Service Proposal.  \nWestern Cheshire Primary Care Trust Board Meeting \nth\n28 March 2007                          AGENDA ITEM NO. 2006/07/66   \n \n2.7. BUSINESS PLANNING PROCESS \n \nThe Consortium and practices will complete the business plan as commissioners of \nservices and not as providers. \n \nBusiness plans, once approved by the PCT, will then form the basis of a \nPCT/Consortium/practice agreement. \n \n2.8.  PUBLIC AND PATIENT INVOLVEMENT \n \nThe Primary Care Trust acknowledges the importance of getting patients involved in \npractice-based commissioning, as law (Health and Social Care Act 2001. Chapter 15. \nSection 11.1) now requires public involvement and consultation.  It is the legal duty of \nall health service commissioners to ensure that ?persons to whom those services are \nbeing or may be provided are, directly or through representatives, involved in and \nconsulted on the planning of those services, the development and consideration of \nproposals for changes in the way those services are provided and decisions affecting \nthe operation of those services?.  In response to this legal requirement, in 2007-08, the \nPrimary Care Trust will ask all practice-based commissioners (whether working \nindependently or in a locality or consortia) to outline within the Practice Based \nCommissioning Plan their arrangements for seeking the views of and engaging with \ntheir patients and the public. The implementation of these plans will form part of the \njudgement from the PCT on the success of the PBC commissioner development plans. \nThe PCT, Consortium and practices should consider how to use practice patients \nforums and PPI infrastructures that the PCT have in place already as and new and \ninnovative ways of engaging local patients. \n \n2.8.1 Patient Surveys \n \nEach of the GP practices undertakes an annual patient survey, as do many of the PCT \nclinical services. The results and findings from these surveys can provide intelligence \non local people's perception of services.  There will also be opportunities to develop \nsurveys relating to issues identified by locality business plans. \n \n2.8.2 Practice Based Patient Groups \n \nSome of the PCT's practices have patient groups; with support offered to the remaining \npractices should they wish to develop one.  This provides a practice-focused group of \npeople who can be asked their views about local services and improvements that can \nfeed directly in to the PBC agenda. \n \n2.8.3 Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) Forum \n \nThe PCT has developed a constructive working relationship with the PCT PPI Forum, \nand worked jointly with them on several initiatives.  The PCT PPI lead will keep the \nForum informed about the development of Practice Based Commissioning business \nplans. \n \n2.8.4 Health Equalities Overview and Scrutiny Committee \n \nWhere Business plans propose a 'substantial variation' to current service provision the \nplans will need to be shared and discussed with the Cheshire County Council Overview \n 12\nPractice Based Commissioning Governance Framework and Locally Enhanced Service Proposal.  \nWestern Cheshire Primary Care Trust Board Meeting \nth\n28 March 2007                          AGENDA ITEM NO. 2006/07/66   \nand Scrutiny Committee. The PCT has developed a working relationship with the \nOverview and Scrutiny Committee and will support practices/localities with this process. \n \n2.9 MANAGING THE POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF PRACTICE COMMISSIONER AND \nPROVIDER ROLES \n \nBusiness plans should be developed on the basis of clinicians commissioning services \non behalf of their practice populations and not as potential providers of services. \n \nClinical engagement in the identification of health needs and the proposals for service \nredesign is crucial to the success of Practice Based Commissioning. Clinical \ninvolvement in developing service specifications is also important to ensure that the \nPCT procures the right level and type of service. \n \nIt is however highly likely that local clinicians either on a practice or consortia basis will \nwish to extend their provider role in response to local business plans. \n \nIn order to manage any potential conflicts of interest and avoid legal challenges, the \nPCT will undertake the procurement and performance management of contracts, \ninvolving appropriate clinical input. This will be conducted in line with the PCT Standing \nFinancial Instructions (SFI) and the guidance issued by the NHS Purchasing and \nSupply Agency.  \n \n 13\nPractice Based Commissioning Governance Framework and Locally Enhanced Service Proposal.  \nWestern Cheshire Primary Care Trust Board Meeting \nth\n28 March 2007                          AGENDA ITEM NO. 2006/07/66   \n3.

Bu?n gyfnod hynod brysur - yr adfyfyrio gofalus, beirniadol a?r cynllunio \nstrategol i ddechrau, ac yn dilyn hynny, buddsoddi a gweithredu i atgyfnerthu sefyllfa?r \nBrifysgol fel sefydliad cynaliadwy sy?n cyfoethogi bywyd cenedlaethol Cymru. Dros y \ndeuddeg mis diwethaf neilltuwyd llawer o amser ac ymdrech yn gweithredu strwythur \nacademaidd newydd y Brifysgol, a pharatoi ar gyfer yr Adolygiad Sefydliadol a gynhaliwyd \ngan yr Asiantaeth Sicrhau Ansawdd yn yr hydref.\nYmysg y buddsoddiadau sylweddol iawn a wnaed gan y Brifysgol roedd cyllid ar gyfer \nprosiectau amrywiol megis rhaglen ryngwladol Ysgoloriaethau Arloesi Tywysog Cymru; creu \nCadeiriau Ymchwil Prifysgol Cymru sydd wedi?u lleoli mewn sefydliadau prifysgol Cymreig \na Llyfrgell Genedlaethol Cymru; datblygu presenoldeb gwe rhyngweithiol i wasanaethu \nanghenion ein myfyrwyr, staff a chyn-fyfyrwyr ledled y byd; penodi tri Dirprwy Is-\nGanghellor ac am y tro cyntaf, creu Cyfadran Academaidd i?r Brifysgol, y mae ei thri Deon \na saith Uwch-ddarlithydd wedi dechrau ar y gwaith o angori gweithrediadau rhyngwladol y \nBrifysgol.\nMae?r egni a?r dalent a gyfrannwyd gan ein staff wedi arwain at gynnydd rhagorol yn ystod y flwyddyn ddiwethaf, yn enwedig \nyn y broses o ddatblygu?r Strwythur Llywodraethu Academaidd a Fframwaith Academaidd Cyffredin newydd ar gyfer graddau \nymchwil (gyda?r olaf yn cael ei gwblhau mewn cydweithrediad ? sefydliadau eraill y Gynghrair). Rydym wedi dathlu hanner can \nmlynedd o gynadleddau a gweithdai addysgol yng Ngregynog, wedi dyfarnu Cymrodoriaethau Addysgu cyntaf Prifysgol Cymru \nac wedi croesawu t?m Cyswllt Myfyrwyr newydd. Mae?r Brifysgol hefyd yn falch o fod yn yrrwr allweddol wrth sefydlu dau brosiect \nmawr newydd: y Gymdeithas Ddysgedig i Gymru a Chyfrifiadura Perfformiad Uchel Cymru.\nFel y byddwch yn sylwi, mae bron pob un o?r gweithgareddau hyn yn ymwneud ? chreu sylfaen gadarn ar gyfer gwaith pellach, \ngan addo dyfodol prysur a chynhyrchiol - a digon o waith yn 2011. Yn y cyfamser hoffwn ddymuno egwyl braf i chi dros y Nadolig \na Blwyddyn Newydd dda iawn.\nYr Athro Marc Clement, Is-Ganghellor\nAr y gweill....\n14 ? 16 Rhagfyr:  Cynhadledd Ymchwil Flynyddol SRHE ? Casnewydd\n16 Rhagfyr:  Seminar lFHE: Determining the Educational Character: What is the role of the Governing Body? - Llundain\nI?ch dyddiadur\n11 Ionawr:  Gr?p Diddordeb Arbennig Profiad Ymgeisydd yr AUA - Manceinion\n18 Ionawr:  Cyfarfod UWASF - Wrecsam\n1Myfyrio am gydnabod cyflawniadau myfyrwyr\nY mis diwethaf fe dreuliais i ddiwrnod yn yr Amwythig mewn seminar o?r enw Recognition, the Diploma Supplement and HEAR. \nRoedd yn canolbwyntio ar gyflwyno ideolegau ac arferion Atodiadau Diploma a?r Adroddiad Cyrhaeddiad Addysg Uwch (HEAR).  \nMynegodd nifer o siaradwyr, gan gynnwys Mr Huw Morris, Cofrestrydd Academaidd Prifysgol Abertawe, fanteision Atodiadau \nDiploma a?r enw da a geir o fod yn ddeiliad llabed Atodiad Diploma.\nRoedd enghreifftiau o Brifysgol Bournemouth yn dystiolaeth bellach o gadernid Atodiadau Diploma a?u goblygiadau i waith \nsicrhau ansawdd yn y sector. Roedd y rhain yn cynnwys astudiaeth arolwg am ymwybyddiaeth myfyrwyr a chyflogwyr o \nAtodiadau Diploma, oedd yn dangos y bwlch cyfathrebu rhwng ymarferwyr a rhanddeiliaid. Er ein bod wedi clywed y byddai \ndeunyddiau hyrwyddo ar gael yn y dyfodol agos iawn, bydd angen dilysu effeithiau?r deunyddiau hyn mewn astudiaethau yn \ny dyfodol. Mae hyn o ddiddordeb penodol i mi oherwydd mae?n dangos y diffyg cyfathrebu sydd rhwng gweithredwyr a rhan-\nddeiliaid yn y sector. Mae?n sicr yn ystyriaeth bwysig i Brifysgol Cymru wrth iddi barhau ??i hymdrechion i ymglymu ??i myfyrwyr \nac astudio?r heriau o sicrhau tystiolaeth o gywerthedd academaidd.\nCafwyd cryn drafod am gyflwyno HEAR ymysg cyfranogwyr y seminar, oedd yn cynnwys gweinyddwyr o brifysgolion Cymru a \nLloegr. Er gwaethaf barn datblygwr y Ganolfan Cofnodi Cyflawniad, fod HEAR \nyn fwy cynhwysfawr nag Atodiadau Diploma, roedd llawer o gyfranogwyr yn \nmynegi pryder a oedd yn  gydnaws yng nghyd-destun addysg ryngwladol/fyd-\neang.\nYn gyffredinol, roedd y seminar yn codi syniadau newydd am ddulliau o \ngyflawni cydnabyddiaeth. Bydd trafodaethau am y gwahaniaethau rhwng \nHEAR ac Atodiadau Diploma yn parhau hyd nes y bydd materion cydnawsedd \nwedi?u datrys. Mae?n ymddangos bod datblygiad HEAR a?i r?l yn y sector \naddysg uwch yn aneglur, ond mae?n bendant werth cadw golwg ar y sefyllfa.\nDr Chung-Hsuan Greg Liang\nRhwydwaith Myfyrwyr Llundain\nUn o?r canfyddiadau allweddol o ymdrechion y llynedd i gyfathrebu?n fwy effeithiol gyda?n \nmyfyrwyr oedd bod myfyrwyr yn ein canolfannau cydweithredol yn dymuno cael mwy o \nfewnbwn i siapio eu profiad addysgol, ynghyd ? gwell cyfleoedd ymglymu. I fynd i?r afael ? hyn, \nmae?r t?m cyswllt myfyrwyr wedi sefydlu Rhwydwaith Myfyrwyr Llundain i ddod ? myfyrwyr sy?n \nastudio am ddyfarniadau Prifysgol Cymru yn un o?r 17 canolfan gydweithredol yn ardal Llundain \nat ei gilydd.\n \nY syniad yw creu llais unedig a fydd yn rhoi adborth i ni o brofiad dysgu?r myfyriwr yn y rhan-\nbarth hwn. Hefyd rydym ni am helpu ein cynrychiolwyr o blith y myfyrwyr o?r canolfannau hyn i \nffurfio rhwydwaith a allai helpu i gefnogi hyfforddiant perthnasol ar gyfer y math hwn o weith-\ngaredd. Fel rhan o hyn, cynhaliwyd ein cyfarfod cyntaf ddydd Mercher 24 Tachwedd a threuliodd \nmyfyrwyr o?r canolfannau cydweithredol yn Llundain y dydd gyda?r t?m cyswllt myfyrwyr, ein \nllyfrgellydd, Ms Bronwen Blatchford ac yn bwysicaf oll, ei gilydd.  \nCafwyd trafodaethau helaeth, oedd yn cwmpasu amrywiaeth o bynciau, gan gynnwys sut i \nwneud y defnydd gorau o?r cyfleusterau llyfrgell ar-lein a?r gwahanol fathau o adborth \nmyfyrwyr sydd ar gael. Gadawodd llawer o?r cyfranogwyr ? chynlluniau gweithredu ar gyfer \ndatblygu a gwella?r dulliau adborth yn eu sefydliadau.\n \nYn gyffredinol, roedd yn ddigwyddiad llwyddiannus a difyr. Casglwyd adborth da a fydd o fudd i \nPC wrth ddatblygu ac rydym ni?n awyddus i ddechrau cynllunio?r cyfarfod nesaf yn Llundain, ym \nmis Chwefror 2011.

new research\n\nHamstring problems among sports men and women are very common but now new research from the University could help prevent top rugby union stars picking up the injury.\n\nThe study, involving elite English Premiership clubs and the senior England team, aims to identify how clubs currently treat and prevent hamstring injuries among their players - and to suggest new methods of preparing players in the future to minimise the chances of picking up hamstring problems.\n\nSadie Jones, a lecturer and PhD researcher at the University's Centre for Sports Studies, is carrying out the research in conjunction with top clubs such as Gloucester, Saracens and Wasps as well as the Rugby Football Union (RFU), the sport?s governing body.\n\n'Little detail is known about current practice in the prevention and treatment of hamstring injuries in elite English rugby union and there does not appear to be consensus as to what constitutes best practice,' she said.\n\n'I'll be working with all the Premiership Rugby Union clubs to gather data on the management of hamstring injuries but it is already clear that they represent a major concern.\n\n'The research will involved talking to doctors, physiotherapists and strength and conditioning specialists to build the first-ever comprehensive audit of current treatment and prevention practice. From this audit, I will aim to provide suggestions for a best practice approach to prevention.' \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nContact: pressoffice@kent.ac.uk\n\nStory published at 10:02am 4 May 2011\n                          \n\n                          \n                            \n                              \n\t\n\t\n        \n        Follow us on Twitter\n\n                                          For all the latest press releases and comment stories\n\n                                  \t@UniKentNews\n\n\n                                  Find out who else to follow by looking at @UniKent's lists\n\n                                  News archive\n\n                                  Search through our news stories dating back to 2008\n\n                                  \n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \n                                  \n\n                                \n\t\n\n\n\n                            \n\n                            ?\n\n                          \n\n                          \n\n                        \n\n\n\n\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\n\t\t\t \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tCorporate Communications\n\n\t\tThe University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent, CT2 7NZ, T: +44 1227 764000\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLast Updated: 25/07/2012\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\tKent on facebook\n\tKent on twitter\n\tKent on linkedin\n\tKent on youtube\n\tKent on flickr\n\tKent on rss\n\n\n\tSocial media at Kent\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t?

The Royal Commission, based in Aberystwyth, is working in partnership with the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust (IGMT) to save this outstanding visual record of industrial buildings and townscapes for future generations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the help of volunteers, the collection has been catalogued, and high-quality scanning will ensure that superb digital images will be available online through Coflein (the Royal Commission’s online database), and both the Ironbridge and People’s Collection Wales websites. In addition, exhibitions, public talks and an authoritative publication are planned for 2012 to further publicise the collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFalcon Hildred is a highly accomplished artist who has dedicated his working life to recording the buildings and landscapes of nineteenth-and twentieth-century industry, producing works of high aesthetic, historic and social value. He has recorded in detail technological and engineering change and a rapidly disappearing way of life. The drawings record Blaenau Ffestiniog (the artist’s home since 1969 and a place he has recorded extensively), and a number of industrial towns in Wales and England. These include Cardiff, Newport and Swansea, as well as Grimsby, Coventry, London and Birmingham.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA major exhibition of selected originals will run from late September 2012 to April 2013 in the Coalbrookdale Gallery at Ironbridge with further touring exhibitions being planned from 2013 onwards. Digital versions of the exhibition will be shown at the Royal Welsh Show and the National Eisteddfod in 2013. A book highlighting the significance of the collection and the artist will be published in September 2012. This publication and the research for it will be the basis for a series of new educational and outreach sessions at Ironbridge led by the Museum’s education staff and their volunteers. Educational material will also be generated for the People’s Collection Wales website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommenting on the award, Peter Wakelin, Secretary of the Royal Commission, said “The acquisition of this collection represents a lifetime’s recording work being safeguarded for the future. Falcon Hildred gives us inspiring new ways of looking at historic buildings and landscapes that readily engage everyone from small children to architects and heritage experts. It is great news that this fantastic resource will be now available to all in perpetuity.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplaining the importance of the HLF support, Steve Miller, CEO of the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust said “We are immensely grateful to the Heritage Lottery Fund for their support in acquiring this amazing collection.  We are looking forward to working with the Royal Commission to ensure that as many people as possible can enjoy the work of a brilliant and unique artist whose documenting of the industrial age is truly breath-taking”.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes to Editors:\n\n\n\n\nThe Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales is the investigation body and national archive for the historic environment of Wales.

The Walking Your Way to Health initiative aimed to improve health through the promotion of regular brisk walking.\n\n    \n\n\n    Its initial focus was on older people and those with cardiac problems, primarily in Community First areas. The funding partners were CCW, the New Opportunities Fund, the Assembly Government and the British Heart Foundation. Local Authorities take the lead in forming local partnerships.\n\n\n    The Walking Your Way to Health initiative in Denbighshire, known as Footloose, is a programme of led walks of 30 minutes and over, with a primary focus on inactive and/or socially isolated individuals. The local partnership, set up at the start to run the programme included Denbighshire County Council who managed the project, Denbighshire Local Health Board, National Public Health Service and Conwy & Denbighshire NHS Trust. The scheme started by targeting Rhyl and, in particular, the two Communities First areas in the town. The scheme expanded into a deprived ward area of Denbigh and then through groups and organisations into other areas of Denbighshire.\n\n\n    A team of 45 trained volunteers lead the walks in their local area. By the end of the three year scheme (the scheme ended in December 2006), 2636 different individuals took part in 681 programmed guided walks. In total there were 13526 participants. Other organisations also took part in the scheme and requested training so that they could lead their own walks. These included the Local Health Board who launched lunchtime walks from St Asaph Business Park and Stanley Hospital. These 'custom' walks accounted for over 4500 participants. Denbighshire County Council has distributed 35,000 self-guided walk leaflets and has logged 133 features about the project in the local media over the 3 years. Other features of the initiative included an incentive scheme to encourage regular walking, GP awareness-raising events and special longer walks.\n\n\n    The scheme is hoping to continue with new funding under the Sports Council for Wales, Let's Walk Cymru initiative. However, the scheme could operate on a smaller scale through the network of volunteer leaders but this will be less successful as the co-ordinator role is vital for continuity, motivation and development.\n\n\n    The key features for success of the scheme included partnership working, a full time co-ordinator, the targeting of groups in or at risk of poor health and the use of volunteers.\n\n\n    \n      Contact Name Katrina Day\n\n      Contact_Role Footloose coordinator\n\n      Contact Telephone 01745 356197\n\n      Contact Email Katrina.day@denbighshire.gov.uk\n\n      Contact Address Denbighshire County Council\n\n      County Hall\n\n      Wynnstay Road\n\n      Ruthin\n\n      LL15 1YN \n\n      Website www.denbighshire.gov.uk\n\n\n      \n\n       \n\n    \n\n  \n\n",

After that it took a little while before the rest of the tries came bowling in,?and a massive?six more were scored, bringing the first half try total for the Blues?to seven.\n\nThe second half was slower, and a lot looser.?Since the game was already won the Blues just tried to open things up and throw the ball. They kept up a good solid defence at all times and made sure nothing got past them. One try was scored by the prop Taufa'ao Filise which was converted to take the score to 58-0.

          "Microsoft Word - Item 6.2 Community Strategyv2.doc \n \n \nMeeting of South Gloucestershire Primary Care Trust Board \nTo be held on: Wednesday 23rd June 2010 \nLocation: NHS South Gloucestershire, 8 Brook Office Park, Emersons Green \n \n \nAgenda item: 6.2 \nSouth Gloucestershire���s Sustainable Community Strategy \n1 Purpose \n \nThis paper presents a summary review of the Consultation Draft of the SCS on behalf of the \nPCT. A copy of the Consultation Draft was circulated to Board members two weeks ago. The \nSCS has been produced by the South Gloucestershire Partnership (SGP). The present \nConsultation Draft already incorporates several comments which were fed back following the \ninitial stage of the review. \n \nThe focus of the review has been to ensure that health aspects are well represented in the \nstrategy and that the commitments placed on the PCT are appropriate. The review consists of \nthe high-level comments presented here and a more detailed set of marked-up comments \nincluding editorial comments.  \n \n2 Recommendations \n \nThe Board are asked to agree the high-level review for feedback to the South SGP by Monday \nth\n27 June 2010. Copies of the detailed marked-up comments are available on request.  \n3 Background ��� South Gloucestershire���s Sustainable Community Strategy. \nThe strategy presents a clear vision for the future of South Gloucestershire to 2026. The \ncurrent version is an update of the February 2008 version and a further update is planned in \nthree years time. The South Gloucestershire Partnership (SGP) has led the development of the \nvision and priorities in the Sustainable Community Strategy and will monitor their \nimplementation, reporting progress.  The SGP also oversees the three yearly review and \nupdate of the Sustainable Community Strategy.  \n \nThe programme for producing the Sustainable Community Strategy is given in Appendix 1. \n \n4 Discussion of issues ��� Health Aspects of the Sustainable Community Strategy \n \nThe strategy identifies seven priority themes each with its own set of specific objectives. The \nobjectives are aspirational and will depend on more detailed action plans for their delivery.  The \npriority themes are wide-ranging and cover the full spectrum of SGP activity, as follows: \n \n1. Investing in children and young people  \n2. Being healthier  \n3. Modernising health and community care services  \n4. Managing future development  \n5. Promoting safer and stronger communities  \n6. Valuing the environment  \n7. Maintaining economic prosperity  \nIf you need this document in a different format, please telephone Lucy Jones on 0117 3302 468 \n \nG:\\Communications Team\\Website updates\\17 June\\Item 6.2 Community Strategyv2.doc Board Paper Page 1 of 6 South Gloucestershire Primary Care Trust: Briefing on Sustainable Community Strategy \n \n \nTransport is included as part of priority theme (4) ���managing future development��� and is recognised \nas a cross-cutting theme relevant to all the priority themes. \n \nAlmost all of the priority themes are affected by a predicted growth in the South Gloucestershire \npopulation. The review has identified that growth predictions are not consistently reflected \nthroughout the strategy. In one part of the text, it is stated that the growth proposed by the draft \nRegional Spatial Strategy (RSS) is not sustainable or deliverable but it is not clear what other \ngrowth predictions are being applied elsewhere in the text. The review will seek clarification on this \npoint. \n \nHealth aspects are represented directly by priority themes (2) and (3). The specific priorities within \nthese themes were drafted by the Directors of Public Health, Primary Care and Adult & Social \nCare. The commitments reflect the strategic plans and priorities of the PCT under the following \nheadings: \n \n��� Being healthier  \no Healthy lifestyles \no Inequalities in health \no Threats to health \n \n��� Modernising health and community care services  \no Quality of life \no Positive contribution \no Exercising choice and control \no Freedom from discrimination and harassment \no Economic well-being \no Personal dignity and respect \no Modernisation \n \nThere are no significant outstanding comments on ���modernising health and community care \nservices���. The priorities under ���being healthier��� clearly reflect the intent of the Public Health \nDirectorate but two additional points are proposed to strengthen and clarify the proposals. The \nfirst is to mention certain key healthy lifestyle behaviours explicitly (i.e. tobacco control, \nsensible drinking, healthy eating, being physically active, etc.).  The second is to emphasise \nthe importance of partnership working (in line with the draft Health Improvement Strategy) in \npreventing ill-health and reducing demand on services by maximizing the benefit gained from \ncollective resources. \n \nAll of the other priority themes (1, 4, 5, 6 and 7) have some bearing on health. \n \nPriority theme (1) ���investing in children and young people��� represents health aspects well \nfollowing the inclusion of previous comments. Only minor comments are outstanding. \n \nThe review of priority theme (4) ���managing future development��� finds that health aspects could \nbe represented more strongly and in particular a commitment should be made to exploit the \npivotal role planning and design play a in tackling sedentary lifestyles, obesity and health \ninequality (e.g. through enabling active travel). In addition, new housing development and \nregeneration provide opportunities to ���build in��� health from the start and to improve existing \nenvironments. \n \nThe review of priority theme (5) ���safer and stronger communities��� finds that health aspects are \ngenerally well represented and in particular the commitments to increase employment and \nreduce derivation in Priority Neighbourhoods are welcomed as these will address the \ndeterminants of health and help reduce health inequalities. Only minor comments are \noutstanding. \nG:\\Communications Team\\Website updates\\17 June\\Item 6.2 Community Strategyv2.doc  \n Board Paper Page 2 of 6 South Gloucestershire Primary Care Trust: Briefing on Sustainable Community Strategy \n \n \nThe review of priority theme (6) ���valuing the environment��� finds that the specific objectives \nwould have inherent health benefits. Only minor comments are outstanding. \n \nPriority theme (7) ���maintaining economic prosperity��� is relevant as it improves wider \ndeterminants of health. This driver could be mentioned as part of ���setting the scene���. There are \nno outstanding comments on the specific objectives. \n \n5 Financial implications  \nNo financial implications for NHS South Gloucestershire relate to this paper. \n6 Implementation and Review of Progress \n \nThe programme for producing the Sustainable Community Strategy is given in Appendix 1. \n \n7 Legal implications \nThere are no legal implications for NHS South Gloucestershire in relation to the SCS. \n \n8 Risk Implications \nThe risk of negative health implications arising from the SCS (and the risk of missing \nopportunities to improve health) should be reduced by NHS South Gloucestershire engaging in \nthe consultation process. \n \n9 Implications for health inequalities \nThe review has sought to ensure that health inequalities are appropriately addressed in the \nSCS. \n \n10 Implications for equalities  (Black and Other Minority Ethnic/Disability/Age Issues) \nAs part of the SCS process, an Equalities Impact Assessment will be completed. \n \n11 Consultation and Communication including Public Involvement \nThe first consultation draft South Gloucestershire���s Sustainable Community Strategy has \nrecently been published for key stakeholder consultation.  Stakeholder comments are to be \nincorporated and a second draft published for public consultation by mid July 2010. \n \n12 Links to: \n \n Tick as Element Explanation / Comment \napplicable \nStrategic Objectives ���   \nStandards for Better    \nHealth \nWCC Competency     \nUse of Resources    \n \n13 Conclusions \n \nG:\\Communications Team\\Website updates\\17 June\\Item 6.2 Community Strategyv2.doc  \n Board Paper Page 3 of 6 South Gloucestershire Primary Care Trust: Briefing on Sustainable Community Strategy \n \nIn conclusion, the Consultation Draft of the SCS already includes most of the relevant \nhealth aspects. A limited number of insertions are proposed by this review to strengthen \nth\nand maximize the health opportunities. These will be fed back to the SGP by Monday 27 \nJune 2010 for inclusion in the consultation process together with more minor comments.  \n \n \n \n \nPrepared by: \n \nNatalie Field, Deputy Director of Public Health \n \nPresented by Dr Chris Payne, Director of Public Health \n  \n10 June 2010 \nG:\\Communications Team\\Website updates\\17 June\\Item 6.2 Community Strategyv2.doc  \n Board Paper Page 4 of 6 South Gloucestershire Primary Care Trust: Briefing on Sustainable Community Strategy \n \n \nAppendix 1:  \n \nUpdate of the Sustainable Community Strategy (SCS) Project Schedule 2010 \n \n  \nPhase 1 - Seek approval of timetable for update of the SCS Deadline \nNovember 09 ��� February 10 \n \nrd\n��� Chief Officers Management Team 3 November 2009 \nth\n14 December 2009 \n��� Executive Briefing \nth\n��� LSP Chief Officers��� Group 25 January 2010 \n  \nPhase 2 ��� Produce draft updated Sustainable Community  \nStrategy for consultation  \nMarch 2010 ��� June 2010 \nth\nAdvise SGP Board, Exec members, COMT, LAA and SCS 17 March 2010 \ntheme leads of suggested programme (by email) \n  \nth\nUpdate LSP Chief Officers��� Group and agree outline project 17 March 2010 \nplan \n  \nth\nUpdate SGP Board  9 April 2010 \n  \nWork with LSP Chief Officers��� Group, LAA and Community By 16th April 2010 \nStrategy Theme Leads, Chief Officers and relevant  \nExecutive Members on amending relevant priorities.

For many of these patients there is no cure: it is more a matter of managing pain and disability so that they can lead as full and healthy a life\nBut, for most people, problems that therapists treat can be avoided by leading a healthy lifestyle and being sensible about how you use your body.\n\nIf you are a therapist who would like to work for the Kent and Medway NHS, please go to our job opportunities pages. Website links related to therapy, with sites mainly catering for professionals, are available on the therapists page in the For Professionals section.\n\n\n\n\nMore informationRoyal Victoria Hospital\n\nOpen times\n\n\nNot currently available\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere service is basedRoyal Victoria Hospital\n\nAddress\n\n\nRoyal Victoria Hospital,\nRadnor Park Avenue,\nFolkestone,\nKent,\nCT19 5BN.\n\n\n\n\n\nWaiting times\n\n\nNot currently available\n\n\n\n\nBook your appointmentSelect an option\nHealthSpace websiteHealthSpace website\nTown / areaFolkestone\nTrustSelect provider trust\nSiteRoyal Victoria Hospital\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t?

The effectiveness of schools in Wales\n\tPublication Date: 01-12-1998\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVisit this website\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nThis paper addresses the issue of using raw-score indicators to compare the performance of groups of educational establishments.\n\nDespite the growth of sophisticated, some might say over-sophisticated, ways of estimating the value-added to a performance by an institution such as a school, raw-score comparisons continue to be made by researchers, journalists and, most frighteningly, by policy-makers. In Wales, whole programmes of improvement measures and targets have been predicated upon the unproved notion that schools in Wales are under-performing, that students are 'schooled to fail', that the majority of secondary schools in Wales--English-medium comprehensives--should be looking to English schools and Welsh-medium schools for their models of improvement strategies. Similar forms of comparison have more recently been used to suggest that the compulsory learning of Welsh hinders the learning of other modern languages. The substantive purpose of this paper is to argue that all such comparisons are rhetorically misleading, and to show that under closer analysis the differences and effect-sizes claimed by the advocates of these positions are statistically insignificant. The lack of difference is so easily discernible in the light of background factors, that one wonders why politicians, some academics and the media continue to cite the differential effectiveness of schools in Wales in support of their preferred programmes of action.\n\nOxford Review of Education, Vol. 24, No. 4 (Dec., 1998), pp. 459-472\n\n\tAuthorsGorard, S.\n\tPublisherRoutledge, part of the Taylor & Francis Group\n\tTypeJournal article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   The Higher Education Academy, c/o Higher Education Wales/Addysg Uwch Cymru, 2 Caspian Point, Caspian Way, Cardiff Bay, Cardiff, CF10 4DQ\nTel: +44 (0)2920 471 520 Email: wales@heacademy.ac.uk\n\n\t© Copyright 2012\n\t\n                        Sitemap\n                    \n\t\n                        Privacy Policy\n                    \n\t\n                        Legal Disclaimer\n                    \n\t\n                        Printable version\n                    \n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Intersectionality will provide a particular frame of reference in considering relationships throughout the course.\n\n \n\n?This training will have particular appeal for qualified therapists who are wishing to develop their practice skills in working with couples and other relationship configurations. Ideally, applicants will have ongoing opportunities for working with clients in relationships, and will draw on this learning throughout the course.\n\n \n\n?The course will provide an understanding and application of an integrative model of therapy, drawing on systemic, psychoanalytic and transpersonal approaches. Opportunities will exist for consideration of psychosexual therapy and particular sexual practices relating to gender and sexual diversities will also be examined\n\nDates:\n\nSat 14 Sept ?\tIntroduction to Psychosexual Therapy with Gender and Sexual Diversities day 1*\n\n \n\nSun 15 Sept \tIntroduction to Psychosexual Therapy with Gender and Sexual Diversities day 2*\n\n \n\nSat 28 Sept \tBisexuality In The Therapy Room*\n\n \n\nSun 29 Sept \tUnderstanding Polyamory and Non-Monogamies*\n\n \n\nSat 5 Oct \t\tDip Relationship Therapy day 1\n\n \n\nSun 6 Oct \t\tDip Relationship Therapy day?2\n\n \n\nSat 19 Oct \tUnderstanding Kink and BDSM*\n\n \n\nSun 20 Oct \tWithout Condoms*\n\n \n\nSat 2 Nov \t\tDip Relationship Therapy day?3\n\n \n\nSat 16 Nov \tI'm Too Sexy: Understanding Sexual Compulsivity in Gay and Bisexual Men*\n\n \n\nSun 17 Nov \tAsexualities: Intimacy and Desire*\n\n \n\nSat 7 Dec \t\tDip Relationship Therapy day?4\n\n \n\nSat 11 Jan \tDip Relationship Therapy day?5\n\n \n\nSun 12 Jan \tDip Relationship Therapy day?6\n\n \n\nSat 8 Feb \t\tDip Relationship Therapy day?7\n\n \n\nSat 8 March \tDip Relationship Therapy day 8\n\n \n\nSat 5 April \tDip Relationship Therapy day?9\n\n \n\nSat 10 May \tDip Relationship Therapy day 10\n\n \n\nFri 6 June \t\tDip Relationship Therapy day 11?

data sources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey points\n\n        \n\t15% of 16-year-olds in 1999/00 did not obtain 5 or more GCSEs at any \n\tgrade or vocational equivalent ('Level 1').  By 2009/10, \n  this proportion had fallen to 10%.\n\t51% of 16-year-olds in 1999/00 did not obtain the higher threshold of 5 \n\tor more GCSEs at grade C or above or vocational equivalent ('Level 2').  By 2009/10, \n  this proportion had fallen to 36%.\n\tThe rate of reduction is - at around a third - similar for both \n\tthresholds.  Note, however, that at least part of these reductions \n\tsince 2005/06 has been due to a widening of what is included as a \n\t'vocational equivalent'.\n\tBecause of precise issues of definition (what is included in \n\t'equivalents', what pupils are included, what schools are included, etc), it is not at all clear that \n\tthe results in Wales are completely comparable to those in England (which is \n\twhy there is no graph with such a comparison).  \n\tComparison with the equivalent \n\tindicator for England does, however, suggest that:\tFor both thresholds, the rate of reduction in Wales has \n\tactually been somewhat slower than its English equivalent.\n\n\t\n\tThe proportion in Wales not obtaining the higher threshold was similar to \n\tits equivalent in England a decade ago but is now noticeably \n\thigher.\n\n\tThe proportion in Wales not obtaining the lower threshold has been \n\thigher than its equivalent in England throughout the last decade and, \n\tindeed, is higher than that in any of the English regions.\n\n\n\n\t\n\tThe proportion of pupils failing to obtain at least 5 GCSEs at any grade \n\tor vocational equivalent ('Level 1') has been falling at a similar rate in all groups of schools, whatever their number of pupils from \n  disadvantaged backgrounds.  In absolute \n\tterms, however, the fall has been greatest for those schools with high \n\tnumbers of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.  So, for example, among the tenth of schools with the highest proportion \n  entitled to free school meals, the proportion of pupils failing to get 5 GCSEs \n  fell from 28% in 1999/00 to 19% in 2008/09, a fall of 9 percentage points.  \n\tWhat all this means is that, whilst there is still substantial gap between performance in schools with many pupils \n  from disadvantaged backgrounds and performance in other schools, this gap is \n\tless than it was a decade ago.\n\tTwice as many pupils in Blaenau Gwent do not obtain 5 or more GCSEs or \n\tvocational equivalent as in some other authorities.\n\n\ntop\n\n\nGraph 1:

first graph shows the proportion of students (defined as \npupils aged 15 at 31 August in the calendar year prior to sitting the exams) \nnot obtaining five or more GCSEs (or vocational equivalent) at grade C or above \n(termed the 'Level 2' threshold by the Welsh Assembly Government).  The data is split \nbetween those who obtained less than \nfive GCSEs (termed the 'Level 1' threshold by the Welsh Assembly Government) and those who obtained 5 or more GCSEs but less than 5 at grade C or above. \n\nThe data source for the first graph is the \nWelsh Assembly Government's publication entitled \nExamination results in Wales and \nits predecessors.  The data covers all schools \nin Wales.  The lower threshold - Level 1 - is understood to be effectively \nthe same as 'fewer than 5 GCSEs of any grade (or equivalent)'.  The higher \nthreshold - Level 2 - is understood to be effectively the same as '5 or more GCSEs (or equivalent) but less than 5 at grade C or above'.  \nUp to 2005/06, the only 'vocational equivalents' included were GNVQs and NVQs \nbut, from 2006/07, all qualifications approved for pre-16 and 16-18 use in Wales \nare included.  This widening of definition has meant the inclusion of a \nlarger range of qualifications and thus a lowering in the proportions not \nachieving the particular thresholds.  Note that the proportion with no qualifications is not \nshown as this data is no longer published.\n\nThe second graph compares the proportion of students \nfailing to obtain the Level 1 threshold for groups of schools with differing\nproportions of pupils receiving free school \nmeals.  For each year's data, both the results and the proportion receiving \nfree school meals relate to that year.  The grouping of the schools has \nbeen chosen to best illustrate the differing trends.\n\nThe data source for the second graph is school-level data \nfrom the National Assembly for Wales (the data is not publicly available).  It \ncovers all local authority maintained secondary schools.  Where either GCSE \nresults or free school meal data for particular schools for particular years is \nnot known, these schools have been excluded from the analysis for that year.\n\nThe third graph shows the \nproportion of students who fail to obtain the Level 1 threshold - five or more \nGCSEs or equivalent - by local education \nauthority.  To improve its statistical reliability, the data is the average \nfor the latest three years.\n\nAs with the first graph, the data source for the third graph is the \nWelsh Assembly Government's publication entitled \nExamination results in Wales \nand its predecessors.\n\nNote that none of the graphs provide a comparison between Wales and the \nEnglish regions.  This is because, with Wales now publishing only their results \nagainst Level 1 and 2 thresholds, it is not at all clear that the data is directly \ncomparable.\n\nOverall adequacy of the indicator: medium.  While the data \nitself is sound enough, the choice of the particular levels of exam success is a \nmatter of judgement.\n\n\ntop\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n      \nPoverty Indicators\n\n      \n\n\tUnited

Workshops are not directed by the school curriculum however you will find many ways to link the content and ideas with learning objectives.\n\nWe aim to work particularly with pupils who express a particular creative interest or aptitude. We invite them to take responsibility for their future direction by negotiating challenges and being active participants in the success of their workshop. We hope that workshops will develop confidence and critical thinking by encouraging a questioning and playful response, and offer an opportunity for pupils to find a voice that may not have been apparent before.\n\nReachOutRCA offers an invaluable opportunity for teachers to work alongside those at the forefront of contemporary art and design practice, giving them observation and participation time outside the demands of a curriculum-led day. By working with teachers as well as pupils we aim to contribute to increasing diversity in higher education and widen the reach of our programme. \n\nPlease contact us at reachout@rca.ac.uk to discuss opportunities for working together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tContact Us?| How to Use This Site?| Accessibility?| Privacy and Cookies\n\n\n                      \n                      \n\t\t\t\t  \n\n\n                \n              \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                 \n                 \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n            \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n",

B. Jukes for a geological survey of Newfoundland. Feels Jukes?s application would have best chance of success if Sedgwick, his Professor at Cambridge, wrote a letter. \n\n\n\n\nTranscription\n\n\n?\n\n?\n\nMy dear Sedgwick\n\nI talked to several members of the Council on Wednesday, about Mr Jukes? appointment, & all seemed to think it would be a very good thing if he has the zeal & courage to go.? You probably may not be aware that he addressed a letter to me (as Secret. of the Soc.), applying to the Council to recommend him to the Governor of Newfoundland.? After deliberation, the Council agreed that it could not, as a body, take such a recommendation on itself, & accordingly I was directed to write to Mr Jukes to this effect, & at the same time to express the wish of the Council, that his application might be successful.? At the suggestion of some present, I told him the best recommendation he could send to the Governor, would be from you, (if you were so disposed), as being the Professor at Cambridge.? And it was in consequence of this, I presume, that Mr Jukes wrote to you.? If he intends going I shall be most happy to assist him, with any suggestions or advice which might occur to me, or in any other way.? Mr Whewell, moreover, said he should be ready, to give him a recommendation to the Governor, as he was acquainted with Mr Jukes, when at Cambridge.? Mr Greenough said his knowledge of him, was too slight for this, but nevertheless he seemed to think him a very proper person.? I shall be happy to do anything, you may wish to further such an undertaking, and I feel the more bound to do so, as I in similar circumstances, received much assistance, from Many.?\n\nBelieve me | Most truly yours? | Chas.

This Annual Health Check looks at how the trust  performed in the 2006/2007 financial year, and is the second year in which these  ratings have been used to measure the overall performance of PCTs nationally.\n\nThe Health Check looks at the performance of a trust in two main  areas:\n\n \n\nQuality of Services: This covers the range of services  and the way a trust is run. It also covers how well it met a range of core  standards and how well it meets existing and new targets.\n\n \n\nUse of  Resources:This looks at how well a trust manages and plans its  finances, how it monitors the money spent and how it makes sure it offers good  value for money through its services.\n\nThe views of the local  community including Buckinghamshire County Council Overview & Scrutiny  Committee and the PCTs Public and Patient Involvement Forum are also included in  the overall rating assessment.\n\nThe PCT was awarded a ?weak? rating  for the Use of Resources by the Healthcare Commission, partly as a result of an  end of year deficit in March 2007. Whilst this rating is a disappointing one for  the PCT, since the information for the Annual\n\nHealth Check was  gathered in March 2007 the PCT has made significant progress\n\nin addressing  these historical financial issues and has put plans in place to achieve  sustained financial stability.\n\nIt?s strategy ?Preparing  Buckinghamshire PCT for the Future? (available at www.buckpct.nhs.uk ) outlines  five key objectives for improving the health and well being of the local  population, including managing the PCT?s healthcare contracts effectively and  delivering high quality yet cost effective prescribing services to ensure  optimal value for money.\n\nFinancial and risk management processes have  been reviewed and improved to achieve a healthier financial position by the end  of 2007/2008. However, because of the way in which the Use of Resources rating  is calculated, it is likely that these actions will not fully be reflected in  the Use of Resources score until 2008/2009.\n\n \n\nIn addition,  Quality of Services was rated as ?fair? because the PCT did not meet a  sufficient number of its national targets, particularly in reducing adult  smoking rates (69% of trusts failed to meet this target) and improving outcomes  for patients with long term conditions, for example by providing community  matrons (77% of trusts failed to meet this target). This rating again  reflects the position as ofthe end of March 2007, a period of  considerable organisational change. The PCT has made substantial progress in  improving its performance since then, notably in reducing cancer wait times and  increasing access to primary care.\n\nThe PCT performed particularly  well in the following areas:\n\n\tSupporting people with substance misuse problems\n\tReducing mortality rates in breast cancer and heart disease\n\tReview of diabetes patients in primary care\n\n\nAlso included in the overall assessment this year were reviews of the  PCT?s Public Health services, and services for patients with diabetes. The PTC  received a ?fair? rating for both  reviews.\n\n \n\nIn addition  all safety standards were met by May 2007 and by July 2007 the PCT had met all  the remaining quality standards, highlighting the high standards of safety and  quality we have now achieved.\n\nThe PCT is working in partnership  with other health providers, notably Buckinghamshire Hospitals NHS Trust, South  Central Ambulance Trust (formerly Two Shires Ambulance Trust) and the  Oxfordshire & Buckinghamshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust to ensure  a shared understanding of the challenges we face and an agreement on priority  areas for joint action.\n\n \n\nJanet Fitzgerald, Chief Executive for  Buckinghamshire PCT said: ??2006/2007 was a difficult year for the PCT and the  pressures on our Trust show no signs of easing.? Although we are pleased to have  been awarded a ?fair? rating for the quality of our services, we recognise that  there is still much work to do. ?There have been notable successes within some  of the standards we did achieve, and since the assessment was carried out we  have made considerable advances in many areas. For example, the PCT is on track  to meet or exceed its targets for reducing the number of cases of  healthcare-acquired infections like MRSA and Clostridium ?Difficile. We are  confident that the PCT can build on these and other successes to improve its  quality rating still further next year. We are aiming to achieve an improved Use  of Resources rating by 2008/2009?.\n\n?While these ratings give a  more rounded picture than the previous star ratings did they cannot reflect the  incredibly hard work staff have put in to meet patient expectations and new  standards. We will be looking at the areas where we have\n\nnot performed as  well as we could. The challenge for us all in the next two years will be to do  better still, and continue the improvement journey that the PCT has already  begun?.\n\n?We will continue to work to deliver quality services and the  Trust and its staff are committed to treating the people of Buckinghamshire well  and providing the best possible healthcare?.\n\nFor more information contact:\n\nRichard Burton\n\nCommunications Manager\n\n01494 552 256 \n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n        Page Options\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        Syndication: RSS | Atom\n\n\n        \n\n        \n        Information\n\n        Published: 18 October 2007\n\n        Updated: 27 January 2009\n\n        \n\n\n        Tags: Healthcare Commission Annual Health\n\n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n    \t\n        \t\n            Contact us | \n            FOI | \n            Jobs | \n            Privacy | \n            Disclaimer | \n            Site map | \n            Site accessibility | \n            NHS Choices | \n            NHS Direct | \n            Twitter \n              \n                 |\n            Facebook \n              \n                 | \n            RSS \n              \n                \n        \n        \n\n    \t\n        Copyright ? 2010 NHS Buckinghamshire\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\t\n    \n    \tWycombe: 3rd Floor, Rapid House, 40 Oxford Road, High Wycombe, HP11 2EE, 01494 552 200\n\n    \t\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The creation of new trauma care networks will help patients by increasing survival rates, shortening recovery times and reducing disability from injury. This is because major trauma centres have the specialist staff, equipment and technology on one site to treat these serious and/or life threatening injuries.\n\nBy developing a region-wide trauma care system we can ensure that everyone in the West Midlands has access to the same high quality trauma care services.\n\nThe West Midlands Strategic Commissioning Group agreed that establishing 3 major trauma centres plus the Birmingham Children?s Hospital as the major trauma centre for children, is the preferred option.\n\nMore details about this can be found in the accompanying??Engagement Briefing.\n\nWe would value your views about the proposal to establish a West Midlands trauma care system. Please read the Engagement Briefing which explains more about this and then complete the questionnaire online at??http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/majortrauma or you can send us your views by email to??info@legacy.benpct.nhs.uk.\n\nYour feedback will be greatly appreciated.
