This is a brief experiment aiming to find traces of the initial development of platform emulation systems, via our current full-text search index of the historical UK web.

## Traces ##

Most of the early hits for 'emulation' brings up results for terminal emulation, or in some cases, things like Floating Point Unit (FPU) emulation. However, some evidence of platform emulation also appears:

* 1996:

## Summary ##

There is clear evidence of the development and distribution of emulators in 1996 on the UK web. Some of the Spectrum emulators seem quite well established by this time, so it seems likely that we would have to track back a few more years to get to their initial releases.

To do so, we would have to reach into the time before the web went mainstream (our web archive holds very little content prior to 1996). Full-text search of Usenet or BBS archives, or of the [Internet Archive Software Collection](https://archive.org/details/software) would probably be required.
