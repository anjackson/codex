It is fantastic news for athletics that the Mayor should want to invest in the Norwich Union London Grand Prix.\n\n\n“The meeting at Crystal Palace is one of the biggest in the world and this money means that we can work even harder to increase the meeting's standing on the international stage.\n\n\n“London needs major sporting events and it is very encouraging to have Mayor Livingstone's involvement and support\"\n\n\nJade Johnson, Great Britain's silver medallist at the Commonwealth Games & European Championships views the Norwich Union London Grand Prix as a crucial date in the sporting calendar:\n\n\n\"As a Londoner, I know how much I value Crystal Palace and the Norwich Union London Grand Prix. I used to attend meetings as a young girl and some of those great nights helped inspire me to get involved in athletics. There's no doubt that London's children need big events to fuel their enthusiasm for sport and I welcome Ken Livingstone taking such an interest in athletics.\n\n\n“Crystal Palace is the home of athletics in Britain and investment from the Mayor is hugely encouraging.\n\n\n“Children, particularly, can be inspired by sport - and with growing fears over obesity amongst school children, anything that encourages them to take an interest in all sports has to be viewed as vital. Athletics - running, jumping, throwing - is the basics of all sports and its importance to health can't be under-estimated\"\n\n\n\n      \n      Notes to Editors\n\n        \n\n\nNotes to editors\n\n\n1. The Mayor will host a press conference with Jade Johnson and David Moorcroft at 10 am, Tuesday 28th January in London’s Living Room, City Hall\n\n2. The sponsorship package is worth £75,000 including a £15,000 contribution from the London Development Agency\n\n3. The Crystal Palace Grand Prix usually attracts capacity crowds of 17,500, with more female and ethnic minority sports fans than usual for a sporting event. \n\n The 2003 Norwich Union LONDON Grand Prix will be held on 8th August.\n\n\n\n      \n       \n        \n        Related Press Releases\n\n        \n        The Mayor has appointed Chris Smith as Chair of the London Cultural Consortium\n\n        \n        Mayor launches public consultation for London's first ever strategy for culture\n\n        \n        Mayor's ten-year plan framework for creativity and culture in the capital\n\n        \n        City Hall Goes Live for unique festival of arts and culture\n\n        \n        The Mayor promotes culture as central to London's economic and social wealth\n\n        \n      \n\n      \n    \n\t \n\n\n\n\n\tTerms and conditions\n \t\n      Accessibility\n\t\n      Privacy \n\n\n\n\t    Top \n      of page\t \tHome  |  About  |  City \n      Hall  |  Contact  |  FAQ  |  Help  |  Jobs  |  Site map   \n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n",

At this stage the OFT has not reached a decision on whether a reference for a more in-depth investigation by the Competition Commission is warranted.?\n\n?On 25 May 2006 the OFT announced it was considering a market study of UK airports. Since that time the OFT has reviewed the issues involved and has consulted the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). It has also held briefing meetings with relevant parts of government including the Department for Transport (DfT). \n\nThe main factors that have influenced our decision to conduct a market study are:\n\n\tthe importance of airports to UK productivity and consumers \n\n\tthe high local market shares of BAA and Manchester Airport \n\n\tthe need for significant investment in new airport infrastructure \n\n\tthe potential for identifying remedies to any competition concerns we find \n\n\tthe OFT is best placed to undertake this study. \n\n\nThe OFT has published a short document outlining why UK airports meet the criteria for launching a study, and the focus and timescales of the study.\n\nDownload UK airports?(pdf 109 kb).\n\nThe OFT intends to examine the scope for benefits to arise from enhanced competition between airports (eg via divestment of airports) or from enhanced competition within airports (eg via divestment or long term lease of terminals or runways within an airport).\n\nIn examining these issues we will be considering the potential for greater competition between airports or terminals, the potential benefits of enhanced competition both in the short term (such as through quality, service and price) and in the longer term (such as through greater incentives to invest in capacity). We will also look at the constraints which may limit increased competition, such as short-term capacity constraints, longer-term planning restrictions, price regulation and the restrictions on trading of landing/take-off slots at airports.\n\nThe OFT currently intends to publish the findings of the study in late 2006. If we find that a market investigation reference is warranted, a reference to the CC could be made, following consultation. Our market investigation reference guidelines? lay out the duties of the OFT in this respect.\n\nGiven the limit to the resources and time available to the OFT and the OFT's decision to carry out only a short study at this time, the OFT will not be contacting all potentially interested parties. We will be directly contacting specific bodies to obtain evidence we believe necessary to reach a conclusion on what course of action the OFT should adopt.\n\nHowever, the OFT welcomes relevant submissions on this topic and?they should be sent to:\n\nAirport study (6th Floor)\nOFT\nFleetbank House\n2-6 Salisbury Square\nLondon EC4Y 8JX\n\nThey can also be emailed to: airports.study@oft.gsi.gov.uk\n\nDeadline for comments: Friday 18 August 2006\n\nSee press release\n\nBack to index of cases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\tmore business information\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\nMarket studies\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ access keys\n| home\n| what's new\n| site map\n| advanced search\n| complaints procedure\n| skip ]\n\n\n\n\n",

PALOMARES at sea off Anzio, Italy. The previous few days had been spent in the “Meddy”, waiting for the greatest “Armada” in history to assemble for the second invasion of Italy, at Anzio Beach-Head. (The first had been at Salerno, further south.)\n\nEventually all the ships were in place, and the huge convoy steamed for Anzio, led by H.M.S. Palomares, a tripod masted ship especially fitted with all the latest R.D.F. equipment and the most advanced ship of this nature in the world. (R.D.F. standing for Radio Direction Finder, the forerunner of Radar.)\n\nWe were off Anzio a little before dawn in a most terrific thunder storm. At dawn the invasion started, and soon all hell was let loose. H.M.S. Palmare’s job was to detect the approach of planes, and pass this information to other ships in the convoy. To do this, the closer we could get to the shore, the better, but the whole of the bay was mined, and eventually we were hemmed in on all sides. To get out of this situation we were exploding the mines by gunshots.\n\nThat night, there was hardly a lull in the “Red alert” all hands on deck, action stations. When there was a lull, a mug of “Ki” (naval term for cocoa) was quietly appreciated below decks.\n\nAs the night wore on, up and down, up and down, began to take it’s effect, and with hardly time to have a sip of “Ki” in between action stations, some began to feel they wanted to ignore the order. I was one of them.\n\nSo far I had faithfully answered the call, others had not, one or two missing out for just once, then back in line. Then came the time, nearly out with exhaustion and a mug of hot “Ki” in my hand, I wanted to ignore the order. Everybody rushed to action stations, except me.\n\nI was a Petty Officer at the time, and therefore in the Chief and Petty Officer’s mess. This was situated below decks in the stern. There was only one entry-exit way, through a water tight door. One could not get out once the water tight door had been closed from outside, and all water tight doors had to be closed on the call to action stations. The Chief Shipwright called, as he prepared to close the water tight door, “You coming Ted?” “No, not this time”, I said, and he closed the door. I sat there, “Ki” in hand, relaxing, then began to think how quiet it was. Suddenly the silence was broken by the heavy metal of the water tight door being opened. “You sure you’re not coming Ted?” I thought for a few seconds, (the exhaustion had slightly gone by now), “Yes, OK, I’m coming,” I said and made for the door.\n\nI stood there waiting for the door to be closed, then we ran up the companionway together. Half-way up, the most horrific explosion rocked the ship, and bits and pieces were flying everywhere.\n\nA mine had hit astern, where our mess had been, where I had been sitting locked in, less than a minute before, the deck rolled up like an opened sardine can.\n\nA marvellous escape, yes, but what, or who, prompted the Chief Petty Officer Shipwright to throw me that lifeline?\n\n© Copyright of content contributed to this Archive rests with the author.

The money would be found from £4 billion worth of efficiency savings already earmarked by Shadow Chancellor Oliver Letwin.\n\n\n\nLaunching the latest policy initiative at a press conference in central London, Mr Howard said: \"People will face a clear choice at the election: Conservatives who will give pensioners dignity, security and respect by increasing the state pension and cutting their Council Tax or Mr Blair, who will forget them and raise their Council Tax.\"\n\n\n\nHe added: \"Under Labour the Council Tax, the most painful of all Mr Blair's stealth taxes, will hit £2,000 for a typical family.  It will be particularly hard for the older generation, people who live on fixed incomes. Many of them served our country at her greatest hour of need, preserving liberty, freedom and Britain's independence for future generations.  Those who have given so much must surely be given their due.  \n\n\n\n\"The next Conservative Government will take action to relieve the Council Tax burden for millions of pensioners.  I will give every home where the adults are sixty five and over a fifty per cent Council Tax discount up to a maximum of £500. This will ensure that five million pensioners have their Council Tax bills cut.\"\n\n\n\nMr Letwin declared: \"Mr Blair claimed he had 'no plans to increase tax at all.' But council tax has soared by 70 per cent since 1997. It is right that we should use a third of the £4 billion available for tax cuts in our first Budget to help the vulnerable and to reverse one of Mr Blair's most unfair stealth taxes. We will halve council tax for millions of pensioners. Mr Blair would double it.\"\n\n\n\nPolicy detail\n\n\n\n- Under the scheme, pensioners over 65 will self-certify on their council tax form, in the same manner as a single person household would register for the single person's discount. No group will be penalised with higher council tax bills in order to finance the discount. \n\n\n\n- The discount will apply to pensioners 65 and over, in the same way as the existing higher income tax personal allowance for over 65s.\n\n\n\n- The tax cut will benefit households where one or more occupants is over 65, but where no adult is under 65. \n\n\n\n- The presence of people under 18 will not count against the eligibility of the household for the discount.\n\n\n\n- The discount will be on top of any existing discounts, for example, the single person's discount or the disabled person's discount, and be applied to the current net bill. \n\n\n\n- Council tax benefit recipients who currently pay some council tax will also receive a 50% reduction off their current net bill.\n\n\n\n- Conservatives will protect existing benefits for pensioners, including the Pension Credit, winter fuel allowance, free prescriptions, concessionary travel and TV licences.\n\n\n\nDownloads\n\n\n\nRead the newspaper advert from the Sunday Telegraph and Sunday Express (PDF format - requires Adobe Reader).\n\n\n\nRead Conservatives' manifesto chapter on policies for older people (PDF)\n\n\n\nRead the Action for Pensioners leaflet (PDF)\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t Send to a friend \t Print\tAbout Rt Hon Michael Howard QC MP >>\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t RELATED NEWS\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\tNew house price tax: Northern Ireland first; now Scotland; England next!\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\tNew Bill to transfer power from central government to local communities\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\tNow the Census snoopers invade your privacy - with a threat of £1,000 fines\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\tGood schools?

THere is a lot of prophetic speculation which you know about so I won't go into it.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHe Scripture teaching is straightforward:\n\n\n\n\n\n1 THess. 4:13Brothers, we do not want you to be ignorant about those who fall asleep, or to grieve like the rest of men, who have no hope. 14We believe that Jesus died and rose again and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him. 15According to the Lord's own word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left till the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep. 16For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. 17After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. 18Therefore encourage each other with these words.\n\n\n\n\n\n5:1Now, brothers, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, 2for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. 3While people are saying, \"Peace and safety,\" destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. \n\n\n\n\n\n    4But you, brothers, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. 5You are all sons of the light and sons of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. 6So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be alert and self-controlled. 7For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. 8But since we belong to the day, let us be self-controlled, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. 9For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. 10He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him. 11Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing.\n\n\n\n\n\n2 THess. 1:3We ought always to thank God for you, brothers, and rightly so, because your faith is growing more and more, and the love every one of you has for each other is increasing. 4Therefore, among God's churches we boast about your perseverance and faith in all the persecutions and trials you are enduring. \n\n\n\n\n\n    5All this is evidence that God's judgment is right, and as a result you will be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are suffering. 6God is just: He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you 7and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful angels. 8He will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. 9They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the majesty of his power 10on the day he comes to be glorified in his holy people and to be marveled at among all those who have believed. This includes you, because you believed our testimony to you.\n\n\n\n\n\nI see in these Scriptures tribulation of believers (persecution) before Christ returns, then resurrection to glory when Christ returns to vindicate his people & judge the wicked. THe wicked will then suffer tribulation in hell.\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tIan\n\n\n\nJoined: 23 Dec 2004\nPosts: 1191\n\n\t\tPosted: Sat Aug 20, 2005 12:32 pm    Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tTHe \"Nobody Left Behind\" book is a careful examination of prophecy. \n\n\n\n\n\nI have given away 5 copies & the only adverse response has been from Mike. \n\n\n\n\n\nYou can read about it here.

Most readers would instantly prescribe diet and\nexercise, but would probably not have the numbers immediately to hand to press\nhome any arguments about whether diet and exercise worked or not. A new\nsystematic review and meta-analysis [1] provides them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystematic\nreview\n\n\n\n\nThe\nreview set out to answer the question whether a lifestyle education programme\ncompared with conventional education improved glucose levels or incidence of\ndiabetes in people at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Two outcome\nmeasures were sought. The change in glucose values two hours after a 75 g oral\nglucose load at baseline, and more than six months later. The other outcome was\ndiabetes incidence. Subjects had to have impaired glucose tolerance, impaired\nfasting glucose, or borderline values, according to standard criteria.\n\n\n\n\nTrials\nhad to be randomised, and searching was limited to English language papers\npublished to November 2004.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\nNine\nstudies were included, eight with information on plasma glucose, and five on\ndiabetes incidence. Seven  involved diet and exercise, and two diet alone;\ncontrols were generally conventional counselling or advice. Trials enrolled 80\nto 3,000 subjects, with follow up from six months to six years; five larger\ntrials had follow up of three years or longer. \n\n\n\n\nThe\naverage age of patients in the trials ranged from 39 to 57 years, and the\naverage BMI from 24 to 31 kg/sq m. Baseline two hour plasma glucose after oral\nload averaged 8-10 mmol/L in individual studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlasma\nglucose\n\n\n\n\nThe\nprime end point was the difference between the two hour plasma glucose from\nbaseline to one year or more. Results for individual studies are in Figure 1.\nOverall, there was a reduction in two hour plasma glucose after an oral load by\n0.8 mmol/L (95% confidence interval 0.4 to 1.3 mmol/L).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Change in plasma glucose at 2 hours after oral load from baseline to one year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiabetes\nincidence\n\n\n\n\nThe\nincidence of diabetes reported in five studies lasting one to six years is\nshown in Figure 2. The weighted mean duration was 3.6 years. The incidence of\ndiabetes was 28% with control (7.8%, or 1 in 13 per year), but only 15% with\ndiet and exercise (4.2%, or 1 in 24 per year). The relative risk was 0.6 (0.5\nto 0.7), and the number needed to treat was 7.4 (6.2 to 9.4) to prevent one\nperson developing type 2 diabetes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Incidence of diabetes over one to six years (mean 3.6 years)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\nThis\nis good evidence, with consistent reductions both in glucose levels and in\ndiabetes incidence over reasonably long periods of time. The reduction of\ndiabetes incidence by half may even understate the case. While the average\nduration was commendably long, at 3.6 years, continued use of a healthy\nlifestyle should continue to generate benefits. A 10-year NNT can be calculated\nat 2.6, for instance. \n\n\n\n\nPut\nanother way, if people in the studies continued to develop diabetes at the same\nrate, after 10 years 8 out of 10 in the control group would have developed\ndiabetes, compared with only 4 out of 10 with the intervention. And of course,\nwe have no information about adherence, so we only know about the effects of\ntreatment on average. It is likely that individuals who really changed their\nlifestyle and stuck to it could reduce their individual risk of developing\ndiabetes to much lower levels. The message is, yet again, that the best way of\navoiding seeing your doctor, except socially, is to eat fruit and vegetables,\nhave a good walk, and perhaps enjoy a nice glass of wine when you get back.\n\n\n\n\nReference:\n\n\n\n\n\tK Yamaoka, T Tango.

In total 957 Expressions of Interest were registered, spanning a wide range of disease areas.  These were invaluable in informing the focus of this call as well as future initiatives.  \n\nThe call for full proposals specifically invites innovative, exciting and high-quality applications for the early testing of novel treatments or interventions in human participants.  It is anticipated the £15 million will be used to fund approximately 20-30 proposals, with the study costs estimated to range between £300,000 and £800,000.\n\nColin Blakemore, Chief Executive of the MRC said: &#8220;The MRC Expressions of Interest exercise has shown that the research community is enormously interested in this area of medical research.  Analysis of the responses has revealed some important streams of research &#8211; particularly in biomarkers and public health research &#8211; which we intend to address with additional funding at a later date.  The Call for Proposals represents an exciting opportunity to boost patient-based research in the UK.&#8221;\n\nThe investment is part of a co-ordinated national initiative involving partners of the UK Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC), including the MRC, The Wellcome Trust, Wolfson Foundation, British Heart Foundation and the Health Departments, who together have committed £82 million to build capacity in experimental medicine in the UK.\n\nTo apply, full applications should be submitted by 17 November 2005 and funding decisions will be made in March 2006.  To submit a full research proposal and for further guidance, visit the MRC website on www.mrc.ac.uk/experimental_medicine_call.  Any queries relating to the proposal call should be emailed to experimentalmedicine@headoffice.mrc.ac.uk.\n\nFor further information, or to arrange an interview, contact the MRC Press Office on 020 7637 6011\n\nNotes to Editors\n\n1. Experimental medicine¹ is defined as investigation undertaken in human beings to identify mechanisms of pathophysiology or disease, to test the validity and importance of new discoveries or treatments.\n\n2. The Medical Research Council (MRC) is a national organisation funded by the UK tax-payer. Its business is medical research aimed at improving human health; everyone stands to benefit from the outputs. The research it supports and the scientists it trains meet the needs of the health services, the pharmaceutical and other health-related industries and the academic world. MRC has funded work which has led to some of the most significant discoveries and achievements in medicine in the UK. About half of the MRC&#8217;s expenditure of more than £500 million is invested in its 40 Institutes, Units and Centres. The remaining half goes in the form of grant support and training awards to individuals and teams in universities and medical schools.

and\n\n\n(d) provide for the application of specified provisions of the Food Safety Act 1990 (regulation 6).\n\n\n\nArticle 5 of the Commission Regulation provides that preserved, deep frozen or frozen spinach already on the market on 15th February 1997 which does not conform to the provisions of the Regulation may continue to be marketed until stocks are exhausted.\n\n\nA Compliance Cost Assessment of the effect that these Regulations would have on the cost of business is available from the Food Contaminants Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Ergon House c/o Nobel House, 17 Smith Square, London SW1P 3JR.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n[1] \n1990 c. 16;

          " \n \n \n \nAccording to the Department of Trade and Industry,  \n \n \n“a social enterprise is a business with primarily social \nobjectives whose surpluses are principally reinvested for that \npurpose in the business or in the community, rather than \nbeing driven by the need to maximise profit for shareholders \nand owners.” \n \n \nSocial enterprise is for anyone who wants to start a business and considers \nsocial and environmental impact as core objectives. Whereas the private \nsector is held accountable for increasing economic return for shareholders, \nand the voluntary sector is charged with increasing public benefit, social \nenterprise is a business model that aims to deliver across a range of \neconomic, social and environmental outputs.   \n \nSocial enterprise has great potential in the following areas: \n   \n• Ensuring financial sustainability for the voluntary and community sector \nby identifying opportunities for earned income  \n• Increasing first time employment opportunities for those on the margins \nof the labour market (long term un-employed and those with physical, \nlearning, or mental health disabilities)  \n• As a model for public service delivery, both as a way to engage in the \nexternalisation of local authority services and to develop local suppliers  \n• Assisting entrepreneurs to bring social and environmentally produced \ngoods and services to niché markets and solutions where there is \nmarket failure  \n• Achieving corporate social responsibility goals for the private sector  \n• Creating new models of employee ownership and participation in the \nprivate sector \n \n"],

\n \n\t \t\n(a) jointly by the company and the Inland Revenue,\n\t \t\n(b) in writing,\n\t \t\n(c) to the Special Commissioners.\n\t \t    (3) The notice of referral must specify the question or questions being referred.\n \n\t \t    (4) More than one notice of referral may be given under this paragraph in relation to an enquiry.\n \n\t \t    (5) For the purposes of this paragraph the period during which an enquiry is in progress is the whole of the period- \n \n\t \t\n(a) beginning with the day on which the Inland Revenue give notice of enquiry into the return, and\n\t \t\n(b) ending with the day on which the enquiry is completed.\n\tWithdrawal of notice of referral\t    31B (1) The Inland Revenue or the company may withdraw a notice of referral under paragraph 31A by notice in accordance with this paragraph.\n \n\t \t    (2) Notice of withdrawal must be given- \n \n\t \t\n(a) in writing,\n\t \t\n(b) to the other party to the referral and to the Special Commissioners,\n\t \t\n(c) before the first hearing by the Special Commissioners in relation to the referral.\n\tEffect of referral on enquiry\t    31C (1) While proceedings on a referral under paragraph 31A are in progress in relation to an enquiry- \n \n\t \t\n(a) no closure notice shall be given in relation to the enquiry, and\n\t \t\n(b) no application may be made for a direction to give such a notice.\n\t \t    (2) For the purposes of this paragraph proceedings on a referral are in progress where- \n \n\t \t\n(a) notice of referral has been given,\n\t \t\n(b) the notice has not been withdrawn, and\n\t \t\n(c) the questions referred have not been finally determined.\n\t \t    (3) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (2)(c) a question referred is finally determined when- \n \n\t \t\n(a) it has been determined by the Special Commissioners, and\n\t \t\n(b) there is no further possibility of that determination being varied or set aside (disregarding any power to grant permission to appeal out of time).\n\tEffect of determination\t    31D (1) The determination of a question referred to the Special Commissioners under paragraph 31A is binding on the parties to the referral in the same way, and to the same extent, as a decision on a preliminary issue in an appeal.\n \n\t \t    (2) The determination shall be taken into account by the Inland Revenue in reaching their conclusions on the enquiry.\n \n\t \t    (3) Any right of appeal under paragraph 30 or 34(3) may not be exercised so as to reopen the question determined except to the extent (if any) that it could be reopened if it had been determined as a preliminary issue in that appeal.\".\n \n\n\n\t \t    (2) This paragraph applies in relation to an enquiry under Part 4 of Schedule 18 to the Finance Act 1998 (c. 36)- \n \n\t \t\n(a) in relation to which notice of enquiry is given after the passing of this Act, or\n\t \t\n(b) which is in progress (within the meaning of paragraph 31(5) of that Schedule) immediately before the passing of this Act.\n\t \t\n\n\n \n\n\t \t\n\n\t \t\n\n\n\n\t \t\n\t \t\nOther UK Acts | \nHome | \nScotland Legislation | \nWales Legislation | \nNorthern Ireland

BT completed its termination of the contracts of 279 London engineering workers last week. BT plans to close its FirstCall division next March, where over 1,000 permanent BT staff have been redeployed after cuts elsewhere in the company.\nUnion leaders in the CWU called a lobby over the attacks last week, with around 30 people attending. Much more is needed if the company is not to get away with being able to sack people at will.\n\n\t\n\n        Return\n        to index \n\n        \n\n\n\n\n",

Ten further \ncases have been reported since the last update (3), giving a total of 20 cases since July 2003 (figure 1). The most recent onset \ndate was 20 February 2004. Cases are spread across England, Scotland, and Wales, with some clustering in the north west and \nmidlands of England (figure 2).  Four of the cases reported that they obtained their heroin through a dealer from Liverpool. Twelve \ncases are in females, and eight in males; the median age is 33 years. All but two cases had severe tetanus (grade 3; table 1); one \npatient is known to have died. \nFigure 1 Cases of tetanus in injecting drug users by week of onset, England, Wales, and Scotland: 1/7/2003-26/2/2004CDR Weekly, Vol 14 no 9: News\nFigure 2 Cases of tetanus in injecting drug users, England, Wales, and Scotland: 1/7/2003-26/2/2004\n \nTable 1 Severity grading of tetanus* \nGrading of severity \nMild to moderate trismus and general spasticity, little or no dysphagia, no \nGrade 1 (mild):\nrespiratory embarrassment\nModerate trismus and general spasticity, some dysphagia and respiratory\nGrade 2 (moderate):\nembarrassment, and fleeting spasms occur.\nSevere trismus and general spasticity, severe dysphagia and respiratory \nGrade 3a (severe): difficulties, and severe and prolonged spasms (both spontaneous\nand on stimulation).\nThe same as for severe tetanus plus autonomic dysfunction, \nGrade 3b (very severe):\nparticularly sympathetic overdrive.\n*Reference (7)\nTo date, information on the tetanus immunisation status is available for ten cases. Of these, three cases reported not to have been \nimmunised at all, and five had had less than the recommended five doses. For two cases, both with severe disease, parental recall \nsuggested that they had received five doses of tetanus in their lifetime. Levels of tetanus immunity are available for eight cases, of \nwhich seven had non-protective levels at the onset of their illness consistent with the diagnosis and with their reported \nimmunisation status. The single case with tetanus who had protective antibody levels, had mild disease (severity 1; table 1). \nClostridium tetani was isolated from one case and tetanus toxin detected in two others. \nThe current cluster of tetanus in IDUs could be explained by contamination of heroin with tetanus spores at any stage during the \nproduction, distribution, storage, cutting, or injecting. The observation that no cases have been reported from elsewhere in Europe \nis consistent with contamination occurring within the United Kingdom (UK). The widespread distribution of cases within the UK \nsuggests that contamination is occurring relatively high up the heroin supply chain. Current descriptive information on the cases \nsuggests that subcutaneous injection of heroin is a contributing factor, which is consistent with previous reports on clostridium \ninfections in IDUs (4, 5). The predominance of women and older injectors among cases in the current outbreak was also found in \nthe cluster of severe illness and death among IDUs that occurred in England in 2000. This pattern can be explained by such \nindividuals being more likely to inject subcutaneously or intramuscularly, due to difficulties in accessing veins (4, 6). Information for \ninjecting drug users on how to prevent clostridium infections is available on \n<http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/tetanus/advice_to_idu_271103.pdf> and <http://www.iduoutbreak.abelgratis.com/>.\nPrior to this incident, tetanus infection in IDUs was uncommon in the UK, with only two cases reported between 1984 and 2000 (7). \nIt is too soon to conclude whether the current cluster is an isolated incident, or reflects a genuine change in the UK epidemiology of \ntetanus as occurred in the United States, where the proportion of IDUs among cases of tetanus increased from 2-5% between 1982 \nand 1994 to 15-18% between 1995 and 2000 (8). \nTwo of the cases in the current cluster were reported to have received five doses of vaccine, suggesting that despite this their \nantibody levels were insufficient to protect against the amount of toxin produced. Generally, those who are exposed to the risk of \ntetanus through injury are recommended to receive tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) even if fully vaccinated (9). This recommendation \nis impracticable for IDUs who may be at recurrent risk through regular injection. The question remains unanswered whether IDUs \nmight benefit from regular boosters to ensure protection from ongoing contamination of heroin and/or from exposure to other CDR Weekly, Vol 14 no 9: News\nsources. Despite this, it is of prime importance that IDUs who have not received five doses of tetanus-containing vaccine or are \nunsure about their vaccination status, should be offered additional tetanus-low dose diphtheria (Td) vaccination. Health \nprofessionals in regular health care settings and drug services should therefore ask IDUs about their tetanus immunisation status. \nMany IDUs will require at least one booster. Unvaccinated IDUs should be encouraged to complete a primary course of Td \nvaccination followed by two further boosters. \nInformation for health professionals (including testing of heroin and paraphernalia) is available at \n<http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/tetanus/menu.htm>.  Complete documentation and diagnosis of all cases of tetanus is \nnecessary to inform future prevention strategies. The Health Protection Agency’s Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre \n(HPA-CDSC) has alerted accident and emergency (A&E) departments, infectious disease units, microbiologists and intensive \ntherapy units (ITUs), and would welcome reports of any person with clinical evidence of tetanus. (Clinical evidence of tetanus \ninfection is defined as mild to moderate trismus and one or more of the following: spasticity, dysphagia, respiratory embarrassment, \nspasms, autonomic dysfunction.) \nPlease report cases using the surveillance form that can be downloaded from the HPA website at \n<http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/tetanus/tetanus_idu_quest.pdf> to Joanne White, CDSC, email: \n<joanne.white@hpa.org.uk>, tel: 020 8200 6868 ext 4446, fax: 020 8200 7868).  Please note that in addition to national reporting, \nclinicians are required by law to notify the case to the proper officer of the local authority (usually the consultant in communicable \ndisease control [CCDC]) if they suspect tetanus. \nReferences\n1.HPA.

The latter consisted predominantly of serogroup W135 \n(9/27) followed by serogroup Y (6/27), and ungrouped (6/27). CDR Weekly, Vol 14 no 9: Immunisation\nOver half (53%) of all confirmed cases were in children aged under 5 years. Serogroup B accounted for 92% of these \ninfections, serogroup C accounted for 1%, and other serogroups for 7%. Two serogroup C infections occurred in this age \ngroup of children (figure 2). Both children had received the MenC vaccination and were documented vaccine failures. \nFigure 2 Serogroups of N. meningitidis identified in cases in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland by age: weeks 40-\n52, 2003 \nMeningococcal disease attributed to serogroup B, and unconfirmed cases, have increased this quarter compared to the \nequivalent period in the previous year (figure 3). Serogroup B increased by 30% (334 cases compared to 232 in 2002) and \nunconfirmed cases increased by 2% (362 cases compared to 353 in 2002). In contrast to last quarter, other serogroups \ndecreased by 7% (27 cases compared to 29 in 2002). Additionally, there has continued to be a reduction in the observed \nnumber of cases of meningococcal disease due to serogroup C. The latter serogroup decreased from 20 to nine compared \nto the equivalent period in 2002, suggesting the positive impact of the MenC vaccination programme in reducing \nmeningococcal disease caused by serogroup C. \nFigure 3 Number of cases of meningococcal disease due to serogroups B, C, and other serogroups: January 2002 \nto December 2003 CDR Weekly, Vol 14 no 9: Immunisation\nRoutine surveillance data have shown increases this quarter compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Clinical \nnotifications increased by 12% (376 compared to 329 in 2002), and laboratory reports by 21% (481 compared to 382 in \n2002). \nThe last two quarters are the first, in recent years, to note an increase in serogroup B meningococcal disease when \ncompared to the same time period in the previous year. The increase this quarter is validated by an observed increase in \nroutine surveillance data, however, it is still too early to tell if this is the start of a new trend.\n* Regional enhanced surveillance of meningococcal disease (ESMD) began on 1 January 1998 in five regions of England and was \nextended to include all English regions, Wales, and Northern Ireland from 1 January 1999. The national enhanced surveillance system \nrelies upon consultants in communicable disease control (CCDC) reporting confirmed and probable cases of meningococcal disease \noccurring in their district each week.

They make provision with respect to the accounts and audit of bodies whose accounts are required to be audited in accordance with Part II of the Audit Commission Act 1998 (other than health service bodies, local probation boards and Passenger Transport Executives). They also make provision in respect of the summary statement of accounts that the Greater London Authority is required to prepare under section 134 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999.\n\n\nThe Regulations supersede the Accounts and Audit Regulations 1996 (as amended) which, together with amending Regulations, are revoked from 1st April 2003.\n\n\nThese Regulations differ in a number of respects from the previous Accounts and Audit Regulations. Of particular note among the changes are the following: a new explicit requirement for authorities to be responsible for their financial management and system of internal control (regulation 4); a requirement for authorities to follow proper internal audit practices (regulation 6); an increase in the financial threshold above which parish councils are required to prepare income and expenditure accounts from ?50,000 to ?100,000 (regulation 9); and the bringing forward of the deadlines for approval and publication of statements of account for principal authorities in a phased way (regulations 10 and 11).\n\n\nRegulation 1 provides that the Regulations shall come into force on 1st April 2003 and that they apply in England only.\n\n\nRegulation 2 deals with the interpretation of the terms used in the Regulations and their application.\n\n\nRegulation 3 deals with the revocation of the Accounts and Audit Regulations 1996 (and amending Regulations), which currently govern the regulation of accounts and audit in the bodies to which these Regulations apply.\n\n\nRegulation 4 imposes a new requirement on relevant bodies, making it explicit for the first time that they are responsible for ensuring that their financial management is adequate and effective and that they have a sound system of internal control which they regularly review.\n\n\nRegulation 5 makes provision in respect of the accounting records and control systems that are to be kept by the bodies to which these Regulations apply.\n\n\nRegulation 6 makes provision in respect of the internal audit system that should be maintained in respect of the bodies to which these Regulations apply.\n\n\nRegulation 7 makes provision with respect to certain of the bodies to which these Regulations apply regarding the preparation of a statement of accounts for each year. This obligation does not apply to parish councils or parish meetings of parishes not having separate parish councils whose gross income or expenditure (whichever is higher) for the relevant year is, and for the preceding two years was, less than ?500,000.\n\n\nRegulation 8 makes provision with regard to the summary statement of accounts that the Greater London Authority is required to prepare under section 134 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999.\n\n\nRegulation 9 makes provision with respect to the accounting statements that must be prepared by certain of the bodies to which these Regulations apply, not being bodies covered by the requirements set out in Regulation 7.\n\n\nRegulation 10 makes provision in respect of the signing and approval of the various forms of accounts required to be prepared under these Regulations.\n\n\nIn the case of bodies subject to the obligation to prepare a statement of accounts under regulation 7(1) of these Regulations the date by which the accounts must be approved is 30th June following the end of the relevant financial year.\n\n\nAt present this obligation has to be met by 30th September following the end of the relevant financial year. In order to assist the relevant bodies to adjust to the new timetable, the timetable is to be phased in over the next three years.\n\n\nIn the case of parish councils or parish meetings of parishes not having separate parish councils which are obliged to prepare accounts in accordance with regulation 9, the date by which they must be approved will be 30th September following the end of the relevant financial year, which is the current obligation.\n\n\nRegulation 11 makes provision in respect of the publication of statements of accounts prepared under regulation 7. The date by which they must be published is 30th September following the end of the relevant financial year.\n\n\nAt present this obligation has to be met by 31st December following the end of the relevant financial year. In order to assist the relevant bodies to adjust to the new timetable the timetable is to be phased in over the next three years.\n\n\nRegulation 12 makes provision in respect of the publication of accounts required to be prepared under regulation 9. The date by which they must be published is 31st December following the end of the relevant financial year, which is the current obligation.\n\n\nRegulation 13 makes provision in respect of the exercise of the rights of local government electors. Under the provisions of section 15(2) of the Audit Commission Act 1998 a local government elector or his representative is entitled to question the auditor about the accounts and under the provisions of section 16(1) a local government elector may attend before the auditor and make objections with respect to certain matters in respect of the accounts. This regulation provides that the auditor shall appoint a date on or after which these rights may be exercised and that he shall notify the relevant body or, if appropriate, the chairman of the parish meeting, of that date.\n\n\nRegulation 14 makes provision in respect of arrangements to be made for the public inspection of accounts and other documents. They must be available for public inspection for 20 working days before the date appointed by the auditor under the provisions of regulation 13.\n\n\nRegulation 15 provides that the accounts and other documents made available for public inspection shall not be altered after they have been made so available, except with the consent of the auditor.\n\n\nRegulation 16 makes provision in respect of the publication of information relating to the right of public inspection of accounts and other documents. The information must be made available to the public at least 14 days before the start of the period during which the accounts and other documents are to be made available pursuant to regulation 14.\n\n\nRegulation 17 makes provision in respect of the contents of any written notice of a proposed objection that a local government elector gives the auditor.\n\n\nRegulation 18 makes provision in respect of giving notice that an audit has been concluded and that the accounts are available for inspection by local government electors.\n\n\nRegulation 19 makes provision in respect of the publication of the annual audit letter that relevant bodies receive from their auditor.\n\n\nRegulation 20 makes provision in respect of joint committees, joint boards, combined authorities and National Park Authorities regarding the deposit of certain documents relating to their accounts and audit with each constituent authority.\n\n\nRegulation 21 makes provision relating to the notice that must be given by a relevant body in the event that the Audit Commission for Local Authorities and the National Health Service in England and Wales directs an auditor to hold an extraordinary audit of the accounts of that body.\n\n\nRegulation 22 declares that the contravention of certain regulations is an offence, as provided for by section 27(4) of the 1998 Act.\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n[1]\n1998 c. 18.back\n\n[2]\n1999 c. 29.back\n\n\n[3]\nThe Secretary of State's functions under the 1998 Act, so far as exercisable in relation to Wales are transferred to the National Assembly for Wales; see article 2 of, and Schedule 1 to, the National Assembly for Wales (Transfer of Functions) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999/672).back\n\n\n[4]\n1972 c. 70.back\n\n\n[5]\n1989 c. 42.back\n\n\n[6]\nS.I. 1996/590 as amended in relation to England by the Accounts and Audit (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2001 (S.I. 2001/3244), the Local Authorities (Capital Finance and Accounts) (England) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000/3237), the Local Government Act 1988 (Competition) (Revocations) Regulations 1997 (S.I. 1997/2747) and the Development Commission (Transfer of Function and Miscellaneous Provisions) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999/416).back\n\n\n[7]\n1977 (c. 49).

[24 February 1903]  Up at 6.30 and went to the Pagoda which \nwas now full of people, pink and green robed.  The women mostly \nwear a pink scarf  round their necks.  Earrings often of rubies, and their \nfaces powdered.  Saw a charming little lady exquisitely dressed in a \npink skirt walking up the temple stairs with two servants behind her \ncarrying baskets - of offerings?  We tried all the gongs in turn - I \nsuppose these seller people are temple slaves.  Upstairs it was \nenchantingly secular with just enough devotion.  I saw one little lady \npraying and smoking alternately.  There were phonographs which \nattracted much attention even from the monks.  Food sellers and \nflower sellers whose shop was a big umbrella.  We saw the famous \nbig bell which was fished from the bottom of the river, but either the \nman didn't use a big enough hammer or the bell has suffered from its \ndipping, for it didn't sound nice.  The enormous mass of tiny temples \nand things is due I imagine to temple building being a short cut to \nNirvana.  In one image house is an enormous reclining Buddha; in \nanother a painted carving representing apparently English soldiers.  \nCame in to breakfast.  Afterwards shopped while H [Hugo] went to \nCapt Kincaid.  At lunch Mr Lowis came to see us, very pleasant a thin \nbusy lawyer.  Settled our plans.  Mr Lowis came again at 4.30.  Tea \nwith the Kincaids, called on Lady White who was out and went back to \nthe Kincaids with whom we drove into the Park, past all the \nmonasteries, round lawns and lakes set with canna in full flower, with a \nview of the Shway Dagon across the water and a red dull sunset \nbehind.  Driven back by a swarm of white ants.  Capital tiny ponies.  \nAfter dinner talked to Mrs Foster and the Booms (the Austrians) and \nwe all smoked a cheroot!  Not bad. \n \n\n\t\nLAST ENTRY\n\t\nNEXT ENTRY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It may seem alarming that this is not the case in the UK, but for the nation’s 10 million registered disabled people and 11.4 million older people who are losing their sight, hearing or dexterity, the fundamental right to have consumer choice is often not a possibility.\n\"These guidelines benefit business as well. Solutions that make products and services accessible to as many people as possible normally benefit all users, meaning that businesses broaden their customer base while developing a reputation for being user-friendly.\"\n\nAntony Rabin, a deaf person comments on how inclusivity benefits everyone: “When I am getting public transport and a platform change is announced, I do not know about it. But at the same time, neither does anyone else who is listening to their personal stereo or ipod. If announcements were also visually displayed, all commuters, not just the deaf ones, would be well informed. I hope that businesses take up these guidelines for equality to customer service and consumer choice.”\nTo purchase a copy of BS7000-6:2005 (standard or large, 14 point, version), please contact BSI Customer Services:\n\nTelephone: +44 (0)20 8996 9001\nFax: +44 (0)20 8996 7001\nEmail orders@bsi-global.com\n\n\nNotes to editors\nFor more information please contact:\nSherylin Thompson\nSenior Media Relations Officer, RNID\nTelephone: 020 7296 8138\nEmail: Sherylin.thompson@rnid.org.uk\nKristen Allen\nBSI, Public Relations Officer\nTelephone: 020 8996 7248\nMobile 07717 451 990\n\tBS 7000-6:2005 will help organisations comply with the Disability Discrimination Act, 1995, that came fully into force in October 2004.\n\tInclusive design is a comprehensive, integrated design that encompasses all aspects of a product (or service) throughout its lifecycle from conception to final disposal.\n\tThis new standard provides a framework by which enterprises, public sector and not-for-profit organisations, as well as executives and design practitioners, can understand and respond to the needs of diverse users without stigma or limitations.\n\tThe standard concentrates on the management of inclusive design and the two main sections contain guidance at the organisation and project levels.\n\tBS 7000-6:2005 is £122 or £61 for BSI subscribing members (P&P £3.90 UK, £5.45 overseas and free P&P to BSI subscribing members)\n\n\nRNID is the largest charity representing the 9 million deaf and hard of hearing people in the UK.

That situation changes constantly, so you could say it is more like a snapshot than a movie. Although the method of producing a balance sheet is standardised, there can be a certain element of subjectivity in interpreting it. Different elements of the balance sheet can tell you different things about the how the business is doing.\n\nThis actionlist gives an overview of a balance sheet and looks at a brief selection of the more interesting figures that help with interpretation. It's important to remember that a lot of these figures do not tell you that much in isolation, it is in trend analysis or comparisons between businesses that they talk more lucidly.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis content is available to subscribers only.

Babar’s future is in the hands of the home secretary.\n\nBabar Ahmad has been held in prison under the act since August 2004. The US claims he is a “terrorist” because he helped run websites supporting rebels in Chechnya and Afghanistan.\n\nThe Free Babar Ahmad campaign is promoting an emergency meeting in the House of Commons at 6pm in Committee Room 11 on Monday 4 July — US Independence Day — to highlight the unjust nature of the extradition arrangements.\nFor more details on Babar’s case, and information on how to help, go to  www.freebabarahmad.com \n\n\t\n\t\t\t© Copyright Socialist Worker (unless otherwise stated).

This flexible form of support will cover a wide variety of work, from a two-year pilot project to a programme of research for five years or even longer. Scientists will be able to specify the work they want to do and the resources and time that they need to do it.\n\nCooperative Group Grants will be replaced with a simpler scheme of Collaboration Grants, awarded as supplements to Research Grants, to provide infrastructure support for networks of collaboration with other research groups, supported by any funding agency.\n\nThe existing Physiological Medicine and Infections Board (PMIB) and the Molecular and Cellular Medicine Board (MCMB), which currently deals with immunology, will be divided to create a new Infections and Immunity Board (IIB). MCMB will retain its present name, but PMIB will become the new Physiological Systems and Clinical Sciences Board (PSCSB). This is one of a number of indicators of the strengthened commitment of the MRC to clinical research.\n\nAll five MRC boards will be given their own budgets and will have new responsibilities for developing their complete scientific portfolios and contributing to strategic planning.\n\nProfessor Colin Blakemore, Chief Executive of the Medical Research Council, said: &#8220;We&#8217;ve taken a long hard look at our existing funding structures and concluded, after consulting widely with the scientific community, that introducing simpler and more flexible funding schemes will better reflect scientific needs and opportunities. Decisions about the duration of awards, as well as the scale of support, will depend on the scientific case presented in applications.\n\n&#8220;The more flexible schemes will also offer greater opportunities for working and funding in partnership with charities, other research councils and the health departments.\n\n&#8220;There&#8217;s a pressing need to strengthen clinical research in the UK. All the MRC boards will continue to fund clinical research, although the new Physiological Systems and Clinical Sciences Board will have a special responsibility for translational research.\n\n&#8220;The New Investigator Awards, announced last month, will help build up the research careers of younger investigators &#8211; another key priority for the MRC.\n\n&#8220;The changes go hand-in-hand with an organisational commitment to greater clarity and openness about MRC&#8217;s scientific policies and procedures. We&#8217;re also putting in place mechanisms for involving the whole research community in developing our strategic thinking and our policies.\n\n&#8220;We hope the changes will aid the MRC&#8217;s mission to improve human health.&#8221;\n\nA sub-committee of the MRC&#8217;s governing body, the Council, will monitor and evaluate the new schemes and will guide the MRC&#8217;s strategic planning.\n\nThe new grant schemes are detailed on the MRC web site at www.mrc.ac.uk.\n\nProfessor Blakemore added: &#8220;These changes will help us respond to the needs of the research community. Also, we&#8217;ll be able to award more for research grants next year than over the past three years, and we&#8217;ve put in place mechanisms to avoid dramatic fluctuations in grant funds in the future. We&#8217;ve also made a bid in the current Spending Review for an increase in our budget, to enable us not only to sustain support for existing world-class medical research in this country but also to make a full contribution to the strengthening of clinical research, for the benefit of patients.&#8221;\n\nIn the current financial year (2003/4), the MRC expects to spend approximately £100m on new research grants, of which £10m is ear-marked money from the 2002 Spending Review. In the coming financial year (2004/5) the MRC expects to spend approximately £168m on research grants, of which £43m is ear-marked money from the 2002 Spending Review and £5m will fund the New Investigator Award Scheme. All the figures represent the full lifetime value of the awards (ie. the full five year cost of a five year grant).\n\nENDS\n\nFor more information contact the Press Office on 020 7637 6011.\n\nNOTES TO EDITORS\n\n*The New Investigator Award was launched in January\n\nMore information on the MRC&#8217;s commitment to clinical research\n\n\tBack to page top\n\n©2006 Medical Research Council\n\nContact the MRC   | Freedom of Information and Data Protection Policy\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout MRC : Public Interest : Funding : Current Research : Strategy :\nPublications : Sitemap : Help : Search\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\tBack to the top | Print This Page\n\tAbout MRC : Public Interest : Funding : Current Research : Strategy : Publications : Sitemap : Help : Search\n\n\t©2006 Medical Research Council\nContact the MRC \n  | Freedom of Information and Data Protection policy  \n \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n",

          "Sobre la cuestión del Saar\n\n\n\nSobre la cuestión del Saar[1]\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPublicado el 4 de noviembre de 1933\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nLa posición del partido [Comunista] oficial y de la KPO\n(brandleristas) sobre la cuestión del Saar[2] me\nparece propia de la cobardía seudorradical, especie de cobardía de ningún modo\npoco común. Naturalmente, nosotros tenemos que estar a favor de un Saar soviéti­co,\nes decir plantear la necesidad de la toma del poder. Pero en ningún lado se\nfijó la fecha de esta conquista, mientras que la del referéndum está muy\nprecisamente señalada en el Tratado de Versalles. Esto significa que el partido\nque lucha por un Saar soviético les debe a los obreros una respuesta al\ninterrogante de cómo votar en 1935.\n\n\nColaborar en la práctica, a través del referéndum, con la\nAlemania hitlerista, significa, teóricamente hablando, poner el misticismo\nnacional por encima de los intereses de clase, y en el plano psicológico\naplicar una política realmente canalla.\n\n\nNaturalmente, sólo los traidores pueden exigir en este\nmomento la anexión, pues eso significa sacrificar los intereses más concretos y\nvitales de los trabajadores alemanes del territorio del Saar, al abstracto\nfactor nacional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1]\nSobre la cuestión del Saar. The Militant, 4 de noviembre de 1933.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[2]\nEl Saar, región occidental de\nAlemania y una de las más ricas cuencas carboníferas de Europa, formaba parte\nde Francia en el siglo XVIII; el Tratado de París de 1815 la repartió entre\nPrusia y Bavaria. Después de la Primera Guerra Mundial, el Tratado de Versalles\nle quitó el Saar a Alemania poniéndolo bajo la administración de la Liga de las\nNaciones y le otorgó a Francia el control de las minas de carbón. Se tomaron\nmedidas para convocar, en 1935, al pueblo del Saar a un referéndum en base a\ntres alternativas: 1) la continuación de la autonomía estatal, 2) la anexión\npor Francia, 3) la devolución a Alemania En 1933 la conquista del poder por los\nnazis en Alemania introdujo, como es obvio, un nuevo elemento en este panorama.\nLos socialdemócratas alemanes, que hasta entonces estaban por la devolución del\nSaar a Alemania, cambiaron de posición en favor del apoyo a la autonomía.\nAunque por razones deferentes, Trotsky y la Liga Comunista sostuvieron la misma\nposición. Esta breve nota de Trotsky es una réplica a las declaraciones que\nhicieron los stalinistas en el verano y el otoño de 1933, que al principio\ntrataron de eludir la esencia de la cuestión con un despliegue de radicalismo\nverbal pero finalmente se decidieron en favor de la devolución a Alemania.\nPosteriormente, los stalinistas cambiaron de línea y se pronunciaron en favor\nde la autonomía, ea decir, contra la anexión por Francia y la devolución a\nAlemania. Pese a la oposición stalinista y socialdemócrata, el 13 de enero de\n1935 la población del Saar votó por inmensa mayoría volver a Alemania.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Now some exciting new physiotherapist-led developments look to spark a new era in pulmonary rehab.\nPulmonary rehab programmes significantly improve breathlessness and people's ability to carry out their daily tasks, research shows. As a result, they are now recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Effectiveness, yet programmes continue to be scarce. A survey by the British Lung Foundation in 2002 showed that 10,000 patients a year had access to pulmonary rehabilitation - a figure that falls far short of the 900,000 patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) each year. \nDr Rachel Garrod is a reader in physiotherapy at St George's Hospital and Kingston University. Having carried out extensive reviews of research into existing programmes, she believes that community rehab is the way to expand services. 'While there is potential to increase delivery within hospital settings, developing services in the community gives greater scope for boosting capacity. \nIt provides a user-friendly environment that is available, accessible and cost-effective, and it's also something that we know patients want.' Professor Sally Singh, head of cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation at Leicester's Glenfield Hospital, agrees that there is a significant lack of provision for patients needing pulmonary rehab. The big problem is that there is no recognised training programme for either health professionals or exercise instructors working in the community. \n'Unlike cardiac rehab, no national service framework exists for pulmonary rehab, hence there is a significant lack of provision and funding in this area,' she explains. But a breakthrough is in the pipeline. Working with the British Lung Foundation and the University Hospitals of Leicester trust, Professor Singh has been developing a community-based phase IV course on pulmonary rehab for exercise instructors. The programme - to be held at Loughborough College - looks set to go ahead after receiving funding from the Coalboard Regeneration Scheme. It is based on the cardiac rehab model, which has been developed by the British Association for Cardiac Rehabilitation (BACR) and is now being run successfully as an approved phase IV training programme. Modules will cover similar topics to the BACR course including physiology, medication, acute and chronic respiratory disorders, exercise prescription, monitoring, progress evaluation, health behaviour changes and emergency procedures.\n'Traditionally exercise professionals and the leisure industry are worried about working with patients in the community who have been undergoing rehab in hospital,' Professor Singh says. 'Our aim is to provide a nationally recognised course to give exercise instructors the knowledge, skills and confidence to deliver much-needed exercise training to this group of patients.'  Another pulmonary rehab scheme developed by physios is currently under review for accreditation by the Register of Exercise Professionals (see Frontline, 14 February 2006). Targeted at intermediate-level fitness instructors who are leading maintenance programmes in the community, the course was put together by physios at the Royal Surrey County Hospital, Guildford. If successful, the aim is to launch it nationally later this year.\nProfessor Singh believes that with better training for exercise professionals in place, there is scope for fast-tracking low-risk patients out into the community, so that they bypass hospital programmes - something that is currently being researched in cardiac rehab at Glenfield Hospital. Sally also stresses the importance of sharing knowledge and information if professionals are to support each other. \nIn Trent, she and colleagues have set up a multidisciplinary consortium on pulmonary rehab to discuss key issues and gather information about local service provision. The findings echo wider research showing that provision is poor and that there is a need for further training among health professionals as well as exercise instructors. \nA new MSc module on pulmonary rehab - the first of its kind - should help to address this. Based at the University of Coventry, where Sally is also professor in pulmonary and cardiac rehabilitation, it will run from the beginning of 2007. 'This is a higher-level course aimed at physios as well as other healthcare professionals. Its focus will be on assessing patients, delivering rehabilitation and developing holistic programmes of care that address the wide-ranging needs of patients.' \nDelivering pulmonary rehab programmes in the community is all about working closely with exercise professionals, Lauren Moore believes. As joint coordinator of the Lambeth and Southwark pulmonary rehab team, based at King's College Hospital, London, she heads a team that includes a BACR-trained fitness instructor, Denise Grant. As well as running pulmonary rehab classes alongside a physio or technical instructor, Denise runs long-term maintenance classes independently. 'Having a fitness instructor in the team is extremely beneficial as they bring expertise in the field of exercise physiology,' Lauren explains. 'Denise has helped us standardise the \"warm up\" and \"cool down\", and is excellent at advising other team members on exercise queries for complex patients. Many patients also have cardiac problems, so she is well-equipped to help us exercise them safely.' \nFor the past three years, physios and nurses in Glasgow have also been training exercise professionals to work alongside them in community rehab classes and to run long-term maintenance classes independently. Elaine Mackay heads the pulmonary rehab service in Glasgow. 'Most exercise coaches have been involved in running 50-plus exercise classes, so they have a basic understanding of working with older people, but we then have to build on this with more specific training about issues such as COPD, breathing control and appropriate exercise,' she explains. Delivery of the eight-week rehab courses is highly structured, with the exercise coaches, physios and nurses each having their own role. As in Lambeth and Southwark, the coaches are responsible for warming up and cooling down patients, and supervising those who are about to move into phase IV maintenance, hopefully ensuring a seamless transition, Elaine says. 'The aim is to provide a rehab programme tailored to the needs of each individual. Everyone has their own exercise diary and individual programme, and we monitor each patient's progress closely.' Running alongside the exercise component are education sessions on diet, pacing and other issues, delivered by a dietician, occupational therapist and clinical psychologist. One concern is that around a third of patients referred for rehab choose not to attend. Elaine notes: 'Those who do attend are highly motivated, but we need to look at why so many people choose not to.'\nExercise coaches in Glasgow will need to be trained differently over the coming months due to big changes in how phase IV exercise classes are organised. Rather than focusing on programmes for specific conditions, the classes will focus more on different intensity levels of exercise. 'There is a lot of overlap which is set to increase if new programmes keep being added,' explains Elaine. The shift should streamline the whole process and make it simpler for people to use. Amanda Dryer, a clinical specialist in respiratory physiotherapy on secondment from Manchester Royal Infirmary, is setting up a community exercise programme targeted at patients with mild-to-moderate COPD. 'Those taking part in the pilot were assessed and briefed thoroughly beforehand, and it was explained how this sort of programme could help them. We felt this was crucial in maximising compliance and motivation.' Patients attend the local leisure centre twice a week for an hour of exercise and an hour of education on topics such as stress management, breathing techniques and management of medicines. Reassessments are to follow shortly. The unofficial results are encouraging. 'People are feeling more positive about what they are capable of, and are doing more - for instance walking rather than catching the bus. We now need the proper results to back up these observations.' The six-week programme, which is being funded by Amanda's local PCT, is being developed in partnership with Alpha, a local sports and leisure development group that was already running subsidised classes in the area. Two physios (herself and another senior colleague) and two fitness instructors work alongside each other on the programme. 'The instructors are very much involved in tailoring exercises to individual patients and ensuring that they equate to goals set at the beginning of the programme.' With so many important developments in the pipeline, what of the future? Rachel Garrod comments: 'Ten years ago patients with chronic lung disease were told not to exercise. Things have moved on significantly, and the case for pulmonary rehab is now widely accepted. But more resources desperately need to be pumped into this area of rehab and into encouraging patients to seek wider access to activities after rehab, such as cheap membership of leisure facilities, and other activities such as walking clubs, dancing and gardening clubs. Physios also need to be aware of the vital role that they can play in improving the quality of these people's lives.'\nThe art of inspiration\nPulmonary rehabilitation programmes can be organised anywhere: inpatient, outpatient or community settings, or at home, yet the community provides the most capacity because it is user-friendly, accessible and cost effective, says Dr Rachel Garrod. The key principle is that programmes must adhere to current pulmonary rehab standards in terms of sufficient exercise intensity, frequency (twice weekly) and duration (at least seven weeks), and include appropriate healthcare professional supervision. Programmes also work best when they involve a multidisciplinary team, Dr Garrod believes. Physios are key to providing effective exercise programmes. Nursing input is needed to help patients understand medication needs, oxygen therapy assessment, vaccines and the importance of early therapeutic management of exacerbations. \nOccupational therapy helps to address relaxation and pacing approaches, while dieticians also play a key role due to complex nutritional requirements. Another important member of the team is the clinical psychologist who can help with a cognitive behavioural approach to address issues such as underlying fears of breathlessness.\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nGarrod R and Backley J [2006].

This is my report under section 88(2) of the Fair Trading Act 1973 (the Act) on the outcome of the negotiations with FirstGroup on the terms of the?undertakings arising from the MMC's report. \n\nRecommendation\n\nI believe that the undertakings attached to this submission satisfy the requirements set out by your predecessor in 1998 and, on that basis, can be accepted. If you decide to do so, the signed undertakings should be published in accordance with section 88(2A) of the Act. \n\nTiming \n\nUrgent. These undertakings, while already being applied to some extent, should be applied in full as soon as possible. \n\nBackground\n\nThe reference and MMC report\n\nThis merger was completed in June 1996 and brought together the two major bus operating companies in central and south east Scotland. The merger was referred to the MMC on 23 September and the MMC reported in January 1997 that the merger operated against the public interest. The MMC recommended that FirstGroup (FirstBus as it was at the time) should be required to divest one of its three operating companies in the area, Midland Bluebird, together with one of the four Glasgow depots of SBH. The Glasgow depot would have to include a network of routes (and buses) representing at least 20% of SBH's turnover in Glasgow. \n\nThe then Director General (John Bridgeman) recommended acceptance of the MMC's findings and recommendation as to remedy subject to some marginal changes. The then Minister for Corporate and Consumer Affairs announced on 24 January 1997 that he accepted Mr Bridgeman's advice and requested that he obtain undertakings to this effect. \n\nFirstGroup's initial response to this announcement was that it was considering a judicial review of the MMC's findings and recommendation. In particular, FirstGroup was concerned about the reliance that the MMC had placed upon statements from Stagecoach that, because of FirstGroup's now dominant position, it would not enter the Glasgow bus market. FirstGroup's concern was given some force when Stagecoach did then enter the Glasgow bus market in March 1997, albeit in a limited way. Following the General Election and change of government in May 1997, FirstGroup made a formal approach to the (new) Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs, Nigel Griffiths MP, requesting that he reconsider his predecessor's decision to accept the MMC's report and my predecessor's advice \n\nThe Minister then asked John Bridgeman to consider and advise on FirstGroup's request that the remedy be reconsidered in the light of the alleged changes to the bus market in Glasgow since the MMC had reported.\n\nReview of the Scottish bus market and MMC's findings\n\nThe OFT carried out an extensive review of the Scottish bus market and John Bridgeman advised, on 13 November 1997, that while the divestment of the Glasgow depot (and routes) was no longer required, FirstGroup should be required to dispose of Midland Bluebird. The Secretary of State replied on 10 March 1998, indicating that she was minded to seek behavioural undertakings from FirstGroup, rather than making the recommended divestment and asked for advice on the composition that such undertakings might take. John Bridgeman responded on 6 April with an outline of the offer of undertakings made by FirstGroup but re-iterating his preference for a structural remedy. The point was made that the undertakings would be seeking to regulate the bus fares for a substantial proportion of the total population of Scotland and would entail significant monitoring costs for the OFT.\n\nThis did not change the Secretary of State's mind and on 31 July 1998 she announced that she had decided to seek a package of behavioural undertakings from FirstGroup, rather than divestment of Midland Bluebird. The undertakings were intended to regulate prices and minimum service levels, and included restrictions on fare and frequency changes, journey intervals and competition against tendered services. The Director General was asked to negotiate undertakings to this effect. \n\nThe undertakings\n\nOne of the main difficulties in seeking to negotiate these?undertakings has been that such a behavioural remedy was substantially different from the structural remedy that the MMC had recommended. As a consequence, the MMC report itself, in considering remedies intended to address the adverse effects which it had identified, did not address behavioural remedies to any great extent. The OFT, therefore, lacked significant information about the behavioural issues which the undertakings were intended to address. To some extent, therefore, my officials have been negotiating from a position of weakness- with some knowledge and experience of the operation of bus markets generally, but little specific information about behaviour in the specific market. This has required rather more discussion of the detail of the undertakings than might otherwise have been the case.\n\nThe two main elements of the undertakings are: a fare cap covering most of FirstGroup's First Glasgow (formerly SBH), Midland Bluebird and Lowland operating areas; supported by a package of essentially anti-predation undertakings covering the Midland Bluebird and Lowland area. The fare cap undertakings are themselves supported by necessary undertakings not to change, without consent, a range of matters including fare types, fare stages and zones, and peak fare periods.\n\nThe fare cap undertaking operates in two parts: first, a fare freeze for a period of 12 months and then a requirement that the increase in the basket of fares in any Fare Year will, effectively, not exceed the change in the RPI index in the preceding year. Because of differences in the way in which fares are set and applied, it has been necessary to allow for separate fare 'baskets' for each of the First Glasgow area and the Midland Bluebird/Lowland area. The latter has, moreover, been slightly refined to allow for a dispensation where Midland Bluebird and Lowland fares are of the same type and value. This is because, due to the different nature of the journey (Midland Bluebird being a largely urban area and Lowland much more rural), FirstGroup may not be able to increase the same fares at the same rate (or at all). \n\nUntil the undertakings have been formally accepted, as a gesture of good faith FirstGroup has sought to apply the principles of the fare cap undertakings since September 1997 in the case of First Glasgow, and since February 1998 for Midland Bluebird and Lowland. There have been some fare increase for FirstGroup companies, limited by the fare cap undertakings, since then. \n\nUnfortunately, there was an information breakdown within the local management at Midland Bluebird/Lowland, who calculated and applied a fare increase in September 2000. Technically, FirstGroup would not have been permitted, under the terms of the undertakings as drafted, to make a fare increase at this time since the full increase allowable in that Fare Year had already been applied in February 2000. \n\nWhile there might be a case for arguing that, following this error, the price cap undertakings should start again- at least for Midland Bluebird/Lowland- this would, in my view, have been unfair on FirstGroup. The company had already foregone any fare increase in the fare freeze period and limited one subsequent fare increase in accordance with the undertakings. We therefore sought to reword the undertakings to allow FirstGroup to bring its operating companies to a common fare increase date by acknowledging but limiting the \"interim permitted increase\" applied in February and September 2000.\n\nMy officials have reviewed the fare increases calculated and applied by FirstGroup to date and are satisfied, subject to the points mentioned above, that these have been made correctly and within the terms and spirit of the draft undertakings.\n\nThe package of anti-predation undertakings apply only within the Midland Bluebird/Lowland area. These include the requirement that FirstGroup shall not reduce its fares and frequencies on routes where a competitor ceases to operate a bus service as a result of action on the part of FirstGroup. The undertakings also provide that FirstGroup shall ensure that any new commercial bus services are evenly spaced between those of a competitor and that it will not provide or operate a new commercial service in competition with a tendered service which it had applied unsuccessfully to run. The undertakings also require that FirstGroup shall not reduce its commercial mileage within the Midland Bluebird/Lowland area to below 95% of that at the date of the undertakings.\n\nAssessment\n\nClearly these undertakings are both broad and complex. They seek to remedy a loss of competition with a regulatory framework of controls- the fare cap applying to a combined area containing some 45% of the population of Scotland. In his letter of 6 April 1998 John Bridgeman outlined his concerns about this approach and so I do not need to repeat them here. Suffice to say that I share those concerns, which have, to some extent, been borne out by the time it has taken to finalise the terms of these undertakings. \n\nDuring the course of these negotiations FirstGroup sought to have the price cap increased after year 3 to the change in RPI+1%. It subsequently withdrew this request when it was suggested that this might delay the consideration of the undertakings. As my predecessor recognised, it is a general feature of such price caps that they tend to be inflexible and unable to respond to exogenous increases in specific costs, such as changes in fuel and duty rates. The price cap, if set too low, might also inhibit investment, for example in new vehicles or in higher quality services or infrastructure. More recently FirstGroup has again mentioned the possibility of reviewing the level of increase permitted by the undertakings at some point in the near future. A review strictly in line with the Secretary of State's views in 1998 could mean that the undertakings might not be reviewed until late 2006 (i.e. not later than five years after they are dated). However, FirstGroup has been applying the principles of the fare cap in Glasgow since September 1997 and, by the time of the next fare increase in September 2002, will have been operating the fare cap in Glasgow for five years. In view of this, rather than including a sunset clause in the undertakings, we propose to write to FirstGroup once the undertakings have been signed setting out our intention, subject to your agreement, to review the operation of the fare cap in Glasgow by September 2002. This may suggest there will be an on-going need to reconsider the level of the price cap, which would significantly add to the monitoring costs to be incurred by the OFT, and the cost to business, but it is an inevitable consequence of this type of undertaking.\n\nIn drafting the undertakings we have sought to reduce the level of monitoring required- for example, by placing a positive obligation on FirstGroup regarding the spacing of bus services (clause 7 of the undertakings) - but there are still a significant number of 'consent' provisions. I am advised by FirstGroup that most of the rationalisation of the former SBH operations has been completed. \n\nYou should also be aware that the OFT has recently received a complaint from Lothian Regional Transport (LRT) - the municipal-owned operator of buses in and around Edinburgh - alleging predatory behaviour on the part of FirstGroup in the supply of bus services in Edinburgh. The complaint is still under consideration and we have, as yet, taken no view on the matter. These undertakings do not, however, apply to bus services within the City of Edinburgh. The price cap element of the undertakings may, however, restrict FirstGroup's ability to cross-subsidise loss making services in Edinburgh with higher fares for the rest of its services in central and south east Scotland. To that extent, therefore, these undertakings may be relevant to the consideration of the complaint from LRT.\n\nConclusion\n\nI believe that the attached?undertakings meet the requirements for the behavioural undertakings set out by the Secretary of State in 1998 and which my predecessor was requested to obtain. The parties have indicated they are content with the terms of the undertakings and have signed them in advance to indicate commitment to them. \n\nIf you agree that these undertakings are satisfactory, I recommend that you accept and date them and that they be published in accordance with section 88(2A) of the Act, in due course.?\n\nBack to mergers advice index page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\tmore business information\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\nMergers FTA\n\n\n\n\nInvitations to comment\n\n\n\n\nAdvice\n\n\n\n\nDecisions\n\n\n\n\nCase history\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ access keys\n| home\n| what's new\n| site map\n| advanced search\n| complaints procedure\n| skip ]\n\n\n\n\n",

The studies responded to concerns raised in earlier work by IIED that markets for watershed services were being promoted without adequate consideration of their costs and benefits. Studies carried out for four countries or regions – the Caribbean, India, Indonesia and South Africa – included an assessment of key watershed management issues and needs; potential market actors; the policy and institutional context; and interest in and demand for market-based approaches.\n\tLinks:\tView PDF report  (367k)\n\n\n      \n\n      Copyright © 2005 International Institute for Environment and Development.\n\n  All rights reserved. \n\n  3 Endsleigh Street, London WC1H 0DD, email: info@iied.org.\n\n  tel: +44 (0) 20 7388 2117, fax: +44 (0) 20 7388 2826.\n\n  UK Registered charity no. 800066.\n\n       Contact\n            the Web Developer | Legal\n      Notice\n\n    \t\n   \n\n      \n      New Publications Publications \n        Help \n\n      \tView some of our flagship publications: \n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n      IIED's Publication Catalogue: From Words to Action:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          view PDF (1.31Mb)\n\n  To obtain a hard copy please email:\n\n  info@earthprint.com \n\n      \n\n      \n\t  \n\t  \n\n\t\t\n           \n\n          \n\n           \n\n        \n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n",

In deciding to move to other challenges, Peter leaves behind him a legacy of having made a seminal contribution to creativity and learning for young people. I think we'll all be looking forward to his next big project.'\n\n\n\nTessa Jowell, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, added:\n\n\n\n'Projects as ambitious and complex as Creative Partnerships are made or broken in their first couple of years - preparation is all.  Peter Jenkinson has made Creative Partnerships work, has made a reality of the theory and he deserves all our thanks for that.'\n\n\n\nPeter Jenkinson said:\n\n\n\n'As founding National Director of Creative Partnerships it has been my great privilege to be involved in setting up a programme that is having such a profound impact on the lives and aspirations of young people and equally of the cultural and creative partners involved.  I am confident that Creative Partnerships will continue to go from strength to strength.'\n\nNotes for editors: \nAbout Creative Partnerships\n\nCreative Partnerships provides school children across England with the opportunity to develop creativity in learning and to take part in cultural activities of the highest quality. The idea behind Creative Partnerships is a simple one – to animate teaching and learning and to enrich school life by making best use of the UK's creative wealth. Based at Arts Council England, Creative Partnerships has an unique approach to working with schools. It first helps schools to identify their individual needs and then enables them to develop long-term, sustainable partnerships with organisations and individuals from the cultural and creative sectors including architects, theatre companies, museums, cinemas, historic buildings, dance studios, recording studios, orchestras, film-makers, web-site designers and many others. \n\n\n\nCurrently there are over 1,600 projects under way in schools involving 1,500 creative and cultural organisations and individuals.  Students have been involved in nearly 4 million hours of Creative Partnerships activity.\n\n\n\nFor its first two years' work (April 2002 – March 2004), it received £40 million from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), working closely with the Department for Education and Skills (DfES).  In June 2003, the DCMS and the DfES confirmed a further £70 million investment for 20 new Creative Partnerships areas – in addition to the 16 currently running – to be created by 2006.\n\n\n\nwww.creative-partnerships.com\n\n\n\nFurther information from:\n\nDavid McNeill, Director of Press and Public Affairs on 020 7973 6458 or 07884 311034 (mobile)\n\n\nCreative Partnerships\n\nLinks\n\tCreative Parternships website\n\n\n\n\t\n\n  \n\n  \n   \t Sitemap \n\t Terms & conditions \n\t Accessibility \n\t Recruitment \n\t Contact us \n\n\n  \n\n   \n\n \n\n",

A total of 115 interviews were conducted (35 non-farmers and 80 farmers) in six study areas in England.  By comparing responses from the current survey to those recorded for the same farms in 2001/02 the researchers were able to explore the restructuring trends and the nature of associated social implications.\n\n      The results of the survey suggest the following key findings\n\n      \ta consolidation of existing restructuring trends\n\tfew farmers appear to be planning to leave the industry in the next five years\n\tfarmers identified as \"active adaptors\" tend to be younger, highly educated and operate large farm business often alongside other business interests\n\tthose who have actively restructured their business, and frequently stepped off the agricultural treadmill, identified benefits in terms of reduced stress, more time for family activities and the opportunity to get away from the farm\n\tin general, farmers are less socially active than non-farmers\n\tamongst the farming population, \"active adaptors\" are more likely to be involved in community based organisations\n\tnon-farmers were more likely than farmers to think that farmers played an economically and socially important role in the community.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n        \n\n\n      Download the report:-\n\n      \tFull report \n           \n          [703KB]\n\n            \n\n        \n\tExecutive Summary \n           \n          [87KB]\n\n\n    \t\n\t\t\t \t\t\n\t\t\t \tPage last modified:\n      2 February, 2006\n      \n\n      Page published: 31 January 2006 \t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\tTop | Help | Feedback | Access Keys | Copyright/Terms | Privacy\tDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\n\n\n",
