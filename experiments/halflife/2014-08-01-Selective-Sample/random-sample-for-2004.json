It is not a \nstatement of government policy but rather a paper to encourage \nfeedback and ideas on what should become UK policy. The document \ndescribes actions that the UK Government is proposing need to be \ntaken as part of the global response to the epidemic.  \n \nThis Consultation Document continues the discussion initiated by the \nUK Government’s Call for Action on HIV/AIDS and will serve as the basis \nfor a far-reaching consultation with civil society, NGOs, international, \nmultilateral and donor bodies, the private sector and developing country \nGovernments. The new Strategy will be published later this year.  \n \nThe primary question being posed during this period of consultation is: \nwhat role should the UK Government play in the global response to \nHIV/AIDS? In particular: \n \n• How best can the UK Government work with its partners? \n• What is the best balance between UK led action and our support of \ninternational action? \n• What is the best balance between multilateral, bilateral and research \nactivity? \n• What should be the balance of work with Government, civil society \nand the private sector?  \n• What should be the balance between prevention, treatment and care, \nand impact mitigation? \n• How should the UK focus its attention between emerging epidemics \nand highly affected countries?  \n• How much attention should be given to Middle Income Countries \n(especially those risking greater impoverishment because of \nHIV/AIDS)? \n \nAPRIL 2004 \nDEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT \n2 CONSULTATION DOCUMENT \nNOT UK GOVERNMENT POLICY \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n1. HIV/AIDS is a major threat to development and the elimination of world \npoverty. No region of the World is unaffected. Whilst the most serious \nepidemics are in Southern Africa, emerging epidemics elsewhere, \nespecially in Asia and Eastern Europe, are growing rapidly and pose a \nsignificant threat. By 2010 there will be more Asians living with HIV than \nAfricans. \n \n2. Over recent years – and especially since 2001 – there have been \nsignificant shifts in the international communities response to HIV/AIDS. \nThis has included: greater international advocacy; increased political \nleadership; substantial increases in global funding; significant international \ninterest in lowering drug prices; and considerable research efforts focused \non the development of new technologies and solutions. However, the \nglobal response to date remains inadequate. We are not on track to \ncontain the epidemic, and in turn, this threatens our ability to achieve all of \nthe Millennium Development Goals. . \n \n3. HIV/AIDS is an exceptional challenge requiring an exceptional response. \nRecognising this, on World AIDS last year, the UK Government published \nits Call for Action on HIV/AIDS. It described the Prime Minister’s strong \ncommitment to the global fight against HIV/AIDS and represented the first \nstep in an intensification of effort the UK to tackle the epidemic. The UK’s \nnew strategy on HIV/AIDS to be published later this year will describe how \nthe whole of the UK Government – led by DFID – is geared to support the \nglobal effort to tackle the epidemic.  \n \nBox 1: Roles and comparative advantages of different UK Government \nDepartments  \n \nThe Department for International Development leads the UK’s efforts to tackle the \nepidemic in the developing world. DFID will build on its strong network of country offices, \nthe technical skill of its staff and leadership role within the international community. DFID \nhas a traditional strength of supporting responses which are pro-poor, equity based, \ngender sensitive, targeted, evidence based and help strengthen nationally owned \nsystems.   \n \nThe Foreign and Commonwealth Office provides high-level political leadership in \ntackling HIV/AIDS both bilaterally, through the work of British Ambassadors and their \nstaff through the world and multilaterally through our engagements in the UN, G8, EU \nand New Partnership for Africa’s Development. \n \nThe Department of Health’s action to combat HIV/AIDS is centred on the epidemic in \nEngland and focuses on policies relating to sexual health and HIV. DH leads on the \nUK’s relationship with the World Health Organisation.   \n \nHM Treasury ensures adequate levels of finance for HIV/AIDS responses, including new \nmodels (e.g. International Finance Facility) and leads on the UK’s engagement with the \nInternational Monetary Fund and World Bank. \n \nThe UK Government’s workforce, especially all those posted overseas, are supported by \nan effective HIV/AIDS workplace policy covering prevention and care. \nAPRIL 2004 \nDEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT \n3 CONSULTATION DOCUMENT \nNOT UK GOVERNMENT POLICY \n \n \n \n4. The UK Government cannot and does not attempt to work in isolation. \nThere is a clear international framework in place for action on HIV/AIDS. \nThe UK will continue to work towards the key international targets set in \nthe UNGASS Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS including: 25% \nfewer infections by 2005; three million people on treatment by 2005; \nachieving the “three ones”; and slowing progress of HIV/AIDS by 2015. To \nachieve these goals, each actor involved in HIV/AIDS – civil society, \nNGOs, international, multilateral and donor bodies, the private sector and \ndeveloping country Governments – must work to their comparative \nadvantages to play a complementary and effective role. Tough choices will \nneed to be made at the global, regional and country level about where the \nUK - and others - should prioritise effort and resources.  \n \nBox 2: The role of the UK Government within an international context \n \nThe UK Government’s response to HIV/AIDS will be set firmly within the international \ncontext. In all of the areas for action proposed in this consultation document, we will \nwork closely with other development partners, focusing our own efforts where we can \nadd most value.  \n \nThe UK Government will continue to work through a mixture of channels: including our \nbilateral country and regional programmes; through multilateral bodies such as the EC, \nthe World Bank, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) and UN \nagencies, who all have an important part to play. We will also work with research bodies.  \n \nThe choice of where best to focus the UK’s efforts between these will depend on which \nelements are is best placed to take action and public-private partnerships. For example, \nwhilst investing in the UK’s bilateral programmes can provide finance and support \ncatalytic approaches, working with the UN harnesses their unique convening function. \nIndividual UN agencies also bring their own specialist skills. These include co-ordination \n(UNAIDS), advocacy (UNAIDS, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNIFEM), technical advice (WHO) \nand delivery (UNICEF). The UK encourages its international partners to play to their \nstrengths, working as part of a coherent overall effort.  \n \n5. This consultation document is structured around five key areas which the \nUK Government considers essential to the global response:   \n \nI. Focusing on the poor \n \nII. Scaling up evidence-based interventions  \n \nIII. Building effective national responses \n \nIV. Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the international response \n \nV. Investing in long-term solutions \nAPRIL 2004 \nDEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT \n4 CONSULTATION DOCUMENT \nNOT UK GOVERNMENT POLICY \n \n \nI. FOCUSING ON THE POOR  \n \n6. The UK’s ambition to eliminate global poverty underpins our commitment \nto addressing HIV/AIDS and to supporting national responses that reach \nand benefit the poor, not the most affluent. Our global approach to \nHIV/AIDS therefore stresses that national strategies need to be pro-poor, \ngender and equity focused and designed in such a way as to reduce \nstigma and discrimination. Towards these ends, the global response \nshould: \n  \nSupport HIV/AIDS programmes that help reduce poverty  \n \n7. HIV/AIDS both causes and is driven by poverty. Unlike other diseases, the \nHIV/AIDS epidemic is particularly devastating as it disproportionately \nimpacts upon both the most productive - who provide economic growth - \nand the poorest in societies.  HIV/AIDS impacts upon the capacity, and \nproductivity of households as well as public and private sectors. \nPreventing, treating and mitigating the effects of HIV/AIDS will reduce \nthese impacts and contribute to poverty elimination. Poverty also \nincreases vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Women and girls living in extreme \npoverty, for example, are more likely to exchange sex for money and \ngoods to survive.  In order to prevent households from falling into chronic \npoverty, responses should support national efforts to develop or extend \nsocial protection programmes in the most affected countries. These \nprogrammes will need to consider the effectiveness and feasibility of cash \ntransfers as a sustainable means of supporting the most vulnerable. \n \nScale up efforts to address gender inequalities caused by the epidemic  \n \n8. Women and girls are biologically, socially and economically more \nsusceptible to HIV/AIDS than men.  Responses should support work with \ngovernment and civil society partners to reduce the factors that exacerbate \nwomen’s and girl’s vulnerability, including promoting women’s rights to \npolitical voice, reproductive health and the inheritance and ownership of \nland. Responses should support efforts to ensure education for girls, \nprioritise efforts to reduce gender-based violence including sexual abuse, \nand scale up efforts to work with men and boys to tackle gender \ninequalities. Responses should also involve working with governments and \nother donors to ensure that national polices and programmes address the \nimpact of HIV/AIDS on women and girls. \n \nSupport strategies that promote an equitable response to HIV/AIDS   \n \n9. Marginalised groups, defined by poverty, gender, ethnicity, age, sexuality, \ndisability or other social factors are particularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS and \nits impacts. Our primary goal should be to ensure that vulnerable and poor \npeople are able to access the information, resources and services they \nneed to prevent, treat and mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS. Responses \nshould ensure equitable access to treatment, including Anti-Retrovirals \nAPRIL 2004 \nDEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT \n5 CONSULTATION DOCUMENT \nNOT UK GOVERNMENT POLICY \n \n \n(ARVs), and care. Responses should support strategies that address the \nrights and needs of marginalised populations. This will require a pro-active \nstance on equity, ensuring the inclusion of disempowered groups, \nlegislative and policy reform, and supporting civil society activities.  \n \nWork to reduce stigma and discrimination related to HIV/AIDS  \n \n10. Freedom from discrimination is a fundamental human right. The United \nNations Commission on Human Rights has confirmed that discrimination \non the basis of HIV/AIDS is prohibited. Stigma and discrimination against \npeople with HIV/AIDS and marginalized populations constitute one of the \ngreatest barriers to preventing, treating and addressing impact of \nHIV/AIDS. Responses should work with civil society, and the private and \npublic sectors to empower people living with HIV/AIDS and marginalised \npopulations; address institutional discrimination in public and private \norganisations; educate people about HIV/AIDS, and support work on \nlegislative reform. Responses should continue to advocate with \ngovernments to ensure that they meet their international obligations on \nhuman rights, including reducing stigma and discrimination.  \n \nAPRIL 2004 \nDEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT \n6 CONSULTATION DOCUMENT \nNOT UK GOVERNMENT POLICY \n \n \nII. SCALING UP EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS \n \n11. There is no single solution for tackling HIV/AIDS. The stage and nature of \nthe epidemic varies across the world. In the worst affected countries \nHIV/AIDS is reversing the development gains of recent years and is the \nmajor obstacle to poverty reduction. Elsewhere there is a time-limited \nopportunity to prevent emerging and concentrated epidemics from \nspreading widely.   \n \n12. Across the spectrum of the epidemic’s stages urgent action is needed \nnow.   Leadership will be vital. Political leaders can dramatically influence \nthe course of the epidemic – for good or ill. Yet while high-level political \nleadership is essential to create an encouraging environment, leadership \nis also pivotal at other levels of society. Faith based leaders have a unique \ncontribution to make, as do leaders in the private sector, traditional \nleaders, community leaders, people with HIV/AIDS and women leaders.  \n \n13. Responses need to be proportional to the need and must therefore be \nadapted to reflect country and regional differences. Choices need to be \nmade about the combination and scale of interventions necessary to \ncontrol the epidemic in each situation.  The basic ingredients of an \neffective response are known: prevention, treatment & care, and \nalleviating the impact on societies. When effectively combined these \nelements have the ability to change the course of the epidemic - but only if \nimplemented in timely fashion and appropriately taken to scale. The global \nresponse should: \n \nStrengthen the effectiveness and coverage of prevention efforts \n \n14. Prevention is the mainstay of any effective response. Urgent action is \nneeded to avert the devastating consequences of widespread HIV \ninfection in countries with emerging epidemics, and to limit spread in \ncountries with established epidemics. We must learn from experience and \napply the evidence of successful intervention. The preventive interventions \nwe know work must be taken to scale.  Prevention programmes require \nleadership and change at the political, community, household and \nindividual levels. Global responses should be informed by evidence and \ninvolve: \n \n• A broad range of biomedical and behavioural responses including: \nongoing epidemiological and behavioural surveillance to better \nunderstand the epidemic; condom promotion and marketing; HIV/AIDS \neducation for young people including life skills and peer education; \nmass and participatory communication; preventing and treating \nSexually Transmitted Infections; blood safety; post-exposure \nprophylaxis; access to male circumcision; and, prevention of mother to \nchild transmission.  \n \nAPRIL 2004 \nDEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT \n7 CONSULTATION DOCUMENT \nNOT UK GOVERNMENT POLICY \n \n \n• Improved access to comprehensive reproductive health rights and \nservices. At the local level, sexual and reproductive health services are \nthe cornerstone of efforts to enable people, especially young people, to \nmake informed, safe and healthy choices. Only about one in five \npeople at risk have access to prevention information and services. \nMore needs to be done to better integrate services for HIV/AIDS and \nreproductive health so that they are complementary and not \ncompetitive.  \n \n• Policy development and targeted interventions to contain the epidemic \nby focusing on vulnerable population groups including: injecting drug \nusers, sex workers, men who have sex with men, mobile populations, \nprisoners and others at high risk. Responses should support harm \nreduction measures for injecting drug users particularly in emerging \nand rapidly accelerating epidemics in Asia and Eastern Europe.  \n \n• Programmes that address the underlying causes of vulnerability and \naim to change the environments in which people have little choice but \nto take risks that may expose them to HIV infection.  Effective \nmeasures include increasing girl’s access to education, supporting \ncommunity mobilisation, securing land rights for women, confronting \nstigma and discrimination and action around livelihoods strategies. \nResponses should support civil society initiatives to increase the \nengagement and voice of people affected by HIV/AIDS, and \nmarginalised populations.  \n \n• Increased access to confidential voluntary counselling and testing, \nwhich serves as a fulcrum between strengthening preventive efforts \nand delivering treatment and care.  Voluntary counselling and testing \nneeds to be taken to scale and rolled out equitably. Testing must \nremain voluntary and confidential, and not involve coercion \n \nSupport efforts to provide increased, and eventually universal, access to \ntreatment and care  \n \n15. Responses should support efforts to provide increased, and eventually \nuniversal, access to treatment and care for people with HIV/AIDS, as part \nof the WHO / UNAIDS ‘3 by 5’ goal to provide anti-retroviral therapy to 3 \nmillion people in developing countries by the end of 2005.. The rationale \nfor this is based on equity considerations, improved effectiveness of \ntreatment programmes in resource poor settings, significant changes to \nthe costs of treatment, and a greater understanding of the fundamental \nimportance of care in effective responses to HIV/AIDS, to restore hope, to \nreinforce prevention efforts, to prolong life and reduce the numbers of \nchildren growing up without carers. \n \n16. Internationally there is now recognition that treatment and care are \nessential components of a comprehensive response. Whereas previously \nthe emphasis in programme design and implementation was firmly on \nAPRIL 2004 \nDEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT \n8 CONSULTATION DOCUMENT \nNOT UK GOVERNMENT POLICY \n \n \nprevention efforts, there is now increasing recognition that treatment is a \nkey component of the response and that care has become a vital and \nnecessary one. Treatment with ARVs is a major prevention and mitigation \nintervention. It can reduce the level of transmission in a population and \ngives people a reason to seek testing. ARV treatment is a pro poor \nintervention as it enables a sick population to maintain economic \nproductivity, reduces ‘short termism’ and asset stripping, prevents or \ndelays widowhood/orphanhood thus preventing the creation of further \nvulnerability to infection. However, this should not mean abandoning \nprevention in order to focus on treatment and care. All elements have to \nbe considered in any response to HIV/AIDS as part of a broad continuum. \nThis will include comprehensive prevention efforts, voluntary counselling \nand testing, anti-retroviral therapy, treatment and prevention of \nopportunistic infections (including TB), home based care, palliative care, \nand impact mitigation.  \n \n17. The global response at the country and regional level should be to \npromote a treatment and care response, within a continuum and working \nin partnership with others, that is pro-poor, equity and gender focused, \nhelps strengthen the systems that deliver health, and supports prevention \nand impact mitigation efforts. Working with civil society and the private \nsector at country level on treatment and care issues is fundamental to an \neffective response.  \n \nDevelop strategies to address the socio-economic impacts of HIV/AIDS  \n \n18. In the worst affected countries, HIV/AIDS is wiping out 50 years of \ndevelopment gains. The immediate impacts of HIV/AIDS illness and death \nare felt at individual and household level through the loss of emotional \nsupport, labour and income. Increased morbidity, mortality and \nabsenteeism for caring and attending funerals will affect civil society, \npublic services and businesses. Projections suggest that, in highly-\naffected countries, there will be long-term impact on saving rates, \ninvestment, markets, services, education and, ultimately on political and \nsocial stability. Global responses should:  \n \nIdentify ways of improving the life chances of young people affected by AIDS  \n \n19. It is not yet possible to predict what long-term effect the epidemic will have \non the generation of children in the worst affected countries who are now \ngrowing up surrounded by death and illness. There are concerns that, in \nsome countries, the effects of HIV/AIDS are generating widespread loss of \nhope and confidence in the future. If left unaddressed, fatalism and \npessimism among young people may increase the risks of social \ndiscontent and, particularly, in countries that are already prone to conflict, \ncould exacerbate existing social and political tensions.  \n \nWork with the public and private sectors to develop and implement strategies \nto mitigate impacts on the labour force  \nAPRIL 2004 \nDEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT \n9 CONSULTATION DOCUMENT \nNOT UK GOVERNMENT POLICY \n \n \n \n20. In some of the most affected countries, HIV/AIDS is having a significant \nimpact on the size and composition of the labour force. This, in turn, is \naffecting the capacity of public and private sectors to function effectively.  \nAt company level, impacts include reduced productivity, loss of skills and \nincreased costs – both undermining performance and profitability. \nSimilarly, HIV/AIDS is weakening the capacity of public services but is also \nplacing new demands on them. Education, health and security sectors are \nall particularly affected.  \n \nSupport orphans and children made vulnerable by AIDS  \n \n21. The epidemic is dramatically reducing life expectancy in the worst affected \ncountries.  It is altering the shape of societies, with a disproportionate \nimpact on young women and on 15-39 year olds. 14 million children have \nalready lost at least one parent to the virus, and the numbers are set to \nrise to 20 million by 2010. Evidence also suggests that orphaning in highly-\naffected countries may be causing early entry into the labour force and \nexacerbating problems of child labour. Like all children, orphans and those \nmade vulnerable by AIDS need to be able to benefit from essential \nservices such as education and health. The impact of orphaning will be \nreduced where treatments are able to prolong the lives of parents and \ncarers. Emphasis will be given to supporting the development of policies to \nprotect and assist orphans and vulnerable children including means of \nexpanding community-based responses to broaden the safety net for such \nchildren. This will involve financial transfers to affected families.  \n \nWork to address the broader impact of HIV/AIDS on social stability, conflict \nand security.  \n \n22. High levels of HIV prevalence can have serious economic, political and \nsocial impact.  HIV rates are suspected to be high in conflict and post-\nconflict countries. Lack of access to information and the breakdown of \nservices create an environment in which HIV/AIDS is easily spread. \nWomen and children may resort to sexual bartering. Conflict conditions \ncan serve to normalise violence, including sexual violence, against \nwomen, children and men. UNAIDS estimates that the prevalence rate \namong some African military personnel is generally three to five times \nhigher than that in the civilian sector and this figure rises during periods of \ndemobilisation. Some military leaders see HIV/AIDS as a huge threat to \nmaintaining the integrity of the armed forces. This has direct implication for \nfuture national security arrangements. HIV/AIDS may also contribute to \nconflict. The impact on individuals, communities and services could lead to \nan increase in social discontent and a decrease in government’s capacity \nto respond. However, there is also evidence in some countries, such as \nUganda, suggesting that HIV/AIDS has not had this effect, serving instead \nas a catalyst for social mobilisation, political engagement and the \nenhanced legitimacy of government and leaders.  \n \nAPRIL 2004 \nDEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT \n10 CONSULTATION DOCUMENT \nNOT UK GOVERNMENT POLICY \n \n \nWork to address the significant impact of HIV/AIDS on food security  \n  \n23. Illness and mortality caused by HIV/AIDS compounds existing problems of \nhousehold and national food security, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. \nResponses should support agricultural development in country and to help \ncreate an equitable international framework for agricultural trade. They \nshould involve close working with FAO, WFP and other relevant \norganisations to improve the planning and management of humanitarian \nresponses to food crises and to ensure that these responses support long-\nterm development efforts, including the additional impacts created by \nHIV/AIDS which require better planning, a faster response, and may need \nto be extended for a longer term. Responses should support efforts to \nincrease the effectiveness of targeting households on the basis of \nvulnerability, rather than HIV status. Given the lack of evidence for the \neffectiveness of targeting on the basis of HIV status, international efforts \nshould aim to improve understanding of the interactions between nutrition \nand HIV/AIDS. The unreliability of data on food security and vulnerability is \none factor that impedes policy planning processes in the agricultural \nsector. Responses should support better data collection and the greater \nresponsiveness of institutions to the changing patterns of vulnerability and \nfood security as the result of HIV/AIDS \n \nWork to address the broader impact of HIV/AIDS on environment and natural \nresource management.  \n \n24. High levels of HIV prevalence can have serious impact on food production \nand agricultural systems, due to the selling of household assets (land, \nanimals etc.) to meet increased medical costs, and reductions in labour to \nmanage the land.  Likewise, common-property resource systems relying \non formal and informal management networks may break down as key \nindividuals succumb \nAPRIL 2004 \nDEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT \n11 CONSULTATION DOCUMENT \nNOT UK GOVERNMENT POLICY \n \n \nIII. BUILDING EFFECTIVE NATIONAL RESPONSES \n \n25. HIV/AIDS is an exceptional challenge demanding an exceptional, but \nsustainable, response built in to long-term planning. Whether addressing \nemerging or advanced epidemics, there is an urgent need to raise \nHIV/AIDS up the political agenda and take programmes to scale at the \nsame time focusing on broader development priorities. The ‘pre-HIV’ \nplanning, management and service structures within many countries are \nnot matched for this challenge and therefore need to evolve. This will \nrequire a pluralistic approach to the way in which aid is delivered. It will \nrequire strengthening health services but also addressing broader service \nand human resource constraints. HIV/AIDS programmes therefore need to \nbe mainstreamed into all sectors, now and in the future, to determine how \neach should respond based on their comparative advantage. Government \naction alone will not suffice. A multi-sectoral approach is required bringing \ntogether government, civil society and private sector responses. Strategies \nneed to be matched to the capacity of each of these actors and integrated \ninto broader development priorities in a particular country’s relevant \nplanning framework, budget or PRSP.  It will also be necessary to adapt \nresponses when working in difficult environments. The global response \nshould: \n \nAdopt a range of approaches to delivering HIV/AIDS aid  \n \n26. A pluralistic approach to aid instruments for HIV/AIDS is required. The \nparticular mix will evolve over time depending on the country context – the \nstage and nature of the epidemic, the national HIV/AIDS response, \ncapacity of different actors and the broader, long-term development \nagenda. While the national HIV/AIDS strategy needs to be part of the \ngovernment’s budget planning process or Poverty Reduction Strategy \nPapers (PRSPs), a rapid response might necessitate support to be \nearmarked to HIV/AIDS or to be channelled outside of government \nfinancial systems, even in countries where general budget support is \naccepted to be the most effective way of providing aid in general. \nHowever, by ensuring the short-term exceptional response is balanced \nwith longer-term mainstreaming and integration in national processes, \nsustainability of the response should be safeguarded. \n \nWork with country governments to strengthen and improve access to \nhealth services  \n \n27. HIV/AIDS can have a severe impact on already weak health systems. It \nplaces increasing demands on all levels of health care delivery and \nsupport infrastructure, including diagnosis, treatment and care of diseases \nand health needs other than HIV/AIDS. In highly affected countries, health \nworkers are faced with a triple burden: dealing with HIV/AIDS in their \nworking lives, potentially being infected themselves, and caring for those \naround them outside work. It is vital that responses to HIV/AIDS do not \nundermine work to provide health services more generally, including in \nAPRIL 2004 \nDEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT \n12 CONSULTATION DOCUMENT \nNOT UK GOVERNMENT POLICY \n \n \nrelation to major diseases like malaria and TB, and on health care \ninterventions such as those promoting maternal and child health. New \nresponses need to build on and strengthen sustainable systems rather \nthan distort resources and policy priorities.  .   \n \n28. In high-prevalence countries in the short-term, HIV/AIDS is likely to require \nan enlargement of the health sector relative to other sectors. While we \nmust not ignore the constraints on the speed at which the sector can \nexpand, well-targeted investments in health services have the potential to \nachieve wider gains in the MDGs for health. There will be a sensible limit \nin the rate at which programmes can expand because of absorptive \nconstraints in health services.  Using many providers and adopting \nstrategies to address bottlenecks, for example in human resources, will be \nimportant in allowing HIV/AIDS programmes to reach adequate scale. \nNon-state actors including community groups, faith based groups and the \nprivate sector will be important in responding to the challenge of HIV/AIDS. \nHowever, it is important to develop health delivery services in such a way \nas to minimise transaction costs of attending clinics and other services. \nMultiple entry points can act as a disincentive to access if poor and \nvulnerable groups have to travel to different locations to receive treatment \nand care for different health care needs. \n \n29. Treatment of HIV/AIDS and opportunistic infections presents particular \nchallenges to national drug procurement, management and supply \nsystems, including in relation to affordability of vital medicines, \nsustainability of financing and rational selection and use of drugs. \nResponses should support efforts to build country capacity around access \nto medicines. These approaches will be consistent with the broader UK \nGovernment Access to Medicines strategy, which is currently being \nproduced. This strategy will outline broad policy and plans for increasing \naccess to medicines for poor communities in poor countries. This will \ninvolve improving the affordability of medicines, increasing research and \ndevelopment into diseases that disproportionately affect poor countries, \nand understanding how developing countries can best work with the \ninternational community to improve access to medicines. \n \n30. A key area related to affordability will be the effective use of the TRIPS \nth\nand Public Health agreement of August 30 2003. National governments \ncan play an important role in partnership with patent based companies in \naccessing differentially priced products, as well as creating the right \nintellectual property regime to allow voluntary licensing and compulsory \nlicensing agreements as appropriate. Effective use of the TRIPS and \nth\nPublic Health agreement of August 30 2003 will be key. High-quality, \neffective and affordable generic competition has an important role to play \nin further reducing the prices of essential medicines for the treatment and \ncare of people with HIV/AIDS, as well as for other diseases particularly \naffecting poor countries. Quality and efficacy issues are of prime \nimportance in relation to all drugs, including generics. Responses should \nsupport efforts to strengthen capacity in medicine procurement, \nAPRIL 2004 \nDEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT \n13 CONSULTATION DOCUMENT \nNOT UK GOVERNMENT POLICY \n \n \nregistration, regulation and monitoring of medicines, and the management \nof intellectual property. \n \nWork with country governments to strengthen access and delivery of \nservices  \n  \n31. Protecting and promoting the livelihoods of people with HIV/AIDS requires \nmore than just effective supply of health services. It requires effective \ndelivery and improved access to a range of services including education, \nagriculture, water, energy and security.  Making these services work \ninvolves not only changing service delivery arrangements but also \nreforming public institutions. It requires making governments accountable \nto their citizens. This implies a focus on changing institutions and systems \nacross government and building demand for services in a sustainable \nmanner. But it also implies putting poor people at the centre of service \nprovision: by improved approaches by which they can monitor and \ndiscipline service providers, amplify their voice in policy making, and by \nstrengthening the incentives for providers of HIV/AIDS services to serve \nthe poor. Responses should support efforts to these ends – to use \navailable resources more effectively by strengthening the public sector and \nreinforcing accountability.  \n \nAddress attrition in human resources for service delivery \n \n32. There is a human resources crisis in many Southern African countries. In \nthe short-term, where HIV risks tipping systems into crisis, responses \nshould support more radical strategies - including better problem diagnosis \n(for example, understanding better the link between HIV, underlying \nsystems failure and migration), special schemes to recruit staff, focused \ntechnical assistance and the training of intermediate cadres. But short-\nterm responses are inevitably insufficient and therefore need to be \nbalanced with a long-term view of human resources and capacity \ndevelopment, addressing problems such as low-pay, migration, \ndeployment and retention as part of wider service delivery systems.  \n \nWork with civil society and private sector to support their role within \nmulti-sectoral strategies \n \n33. Responses should support the scaling up and greater coordination of civil \nsociety initiatives to address HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, care and \nimpact mitigation. Responses should also support the engagement of \nfaith-based organisations that are effectively addressing stigma and \ndiscrimination. Civil society also has an important role in promoting \npolitical voice and participation. Responses should support the \nengagement of civil society, including organisations representing people \nliving with HIV/AIDS, marginalized populations and women’s groups, in \npolicy, planning and implementation processes. The media also has an \nimportant role in tackling stigma and discrimination.  \n \nAPRIL 2004 \nDEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT \n14 CONSULTATION DOCUMENT \nNOT UK GOVERNMENT POLICY \n \n \n34. Responses should support efforts to further increase awareness among \nbusinesses of the impacts of HIV/AIDS as well as dissemination of \nemerging best practice in workplace policies and broader company \nresponse strategies. In particular, responses should support work to \nfacilitate lesson learning between large companies and their suppliers as \nwell as efforts to strengthen the capacity of the informal sector – in which \nmany of the poor are employed – to respond to the epidemic. Furthermore, \naction by the private sector to provide leadership and advocacy for \nGovernment action on HIV/AIDS should be supported, as should public-\nprivate partnerships with Government and civil society to deliver effective \nservices.   \n \n35. Response should continue to work with pharmaceutical companies to help \nmake vital medicines available in developing countries. Research and \ndevelopment into new medicines and preventive technologies and \nstrategies to ensure equitable access to new technologies and medicines \nby the poor should be encouraged. \n \nAdapting to the challenge of working in difficult environments \n \n36. The range of potential partners varies widely country to country.  In \ncountries identified as 'good' policy environments there is often a large \nrange of financing and technical support on offer.  Defining the UK \ncomparative advantage in 'donor crowded' settings is essential, and \nreinforcing the message of the Three Ones, becomes the UK's most \nimportant contribution, ensuring harmonisation of funding, policy and \nplanning, led by government.   \n \n37. In weak and failing states, which contribute significantly to fuelling the \nepidemic, there has to be much better international understanding of what \nworks in poor policy environments.  In some of these settings the UN may \nbe the credible partner, in others civil society may be preferred.   The UK \nresponse at global level in providing support to these key agencies to \nenable them to tackle HIV is difficult environments is essential (e.g. \nUNHCR, WHO through its Health Action in Crises, UNICEF, UNDP and \nothers) \n \nAPRIL 2004 \nDEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT \n15 CONSULTATION DOCUMENT \nNOT UK GOVERNMENT POLICY \n \n \nIV. IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF \nTHE INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE \n \n38. An efficient and effective national response depends on both ensuring \nsufficient resources to tackle the crisis and ensuring that these resources \nare used to maximum benefit. UNAIDS estimates that there is a large and \ngrowing resource gap between global finances available for HIV/AIDS \nprogrammes and estimates of what could usefully be absorbed in low and \nmiddle income countries – US$10.5bn in 2005 rising to US$15bn in 2007. \nHowever, resource flows have increased and since 2001 there has been a \nsubstantial increase in the international response to HIV/AIDS, with many \nnew actors emerging, as well as existing institutions (e.g. the World Bank) \nenhancing their response. In an increasingly crowded arena, a scaled up \n‘exceptional’ response runs the risk of weakening service delivery and \nundermining sustainable interventions. Several countries appear to be \nfacing difficulties in absorbing new finances and will have to manage any \npotential macro-economic impact of HIV/AIDS aid. Support for HIV-\naffected countries must be harmonised at both international and national \nlevels - to ensure resources are used as efficiently and effectively as \npossible.  The global response should: \n \nTake a lead in promoting better harmonisation \n \n39. Better harmonisation is required between donors and recipient countries. \nWorking with UNAIDS, responses should mobilise support for \nimplementing the “Three Ones” principles: one agreed HIV/AIDS Action \nFramework that drives alignment of all partners; one national AIDS \nauthority, with a broad-based multi-sectoral mandate; and one agreed \ncountry-level monitoring and evaluation system.  \n \nEnsure that macroeconomic policies support effective responses  \n \n40. Funding flows must be managed to avoid instability but medium term \nexpenditure ceilings should not be unjustifiably tight.  Countries sometimes \nfeel pressure to be too tight in the face of new aid.  New flows of aid \nshould be made in a transparent, predictable and smoothly disbursing \nmanner as possible. Erratic and unpredictable flows would cause damage \nto macroeconomic stability and also to the HIV/AIDS programmes they are \nsupposed to support.  Responses should encourage medium and long-\nterm sustainability in the level of flows from all major donors and support \nthe work of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to handle \nraising and targeting aid for HIV/AIDS in macroeconomic policy dialogue. \n \nIncrease the capacity of countries to absorb new funding  \n \n41. Responses should support efforts to better understand the constraints on \ncountry’s absorptive capacity. They should also  increase the capacity of \ncountries to absorb new HIV/AIDS funding and for this to be used \neffectively. This will involve integrating the national HIV/AIDS strategy and \nAPRIL 2004 \nDEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT \n16 CONSULTATION DOCUMENT \nNOT UK GOVERNMENT POLICY \n \n \nensuring transparency with the central budget and PRSP planning \nprocess. It will also include addressing the potential of civil society and the \nprivate sector to work alongside national governments. \n \nAPRIL 2004 \nDEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT \n17 CONSULTATION DOCUMENT \nNOT UK GOVERNMENT POLICY \n \n \nV. INVESTING IN LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS \n \n42. It is crucial that immediate action to take evidence-based strategies to \nscale is balanced with a longer-term view of how to tackle the epidemic.  .  \nIn the first instance, substantial effort, commitment and resources is \nrequired to sustain the prevention, treatment and care, and impact \nmitigation programmes being taken to scale now. The stock of \ninternational best practices should also be updated and disseminated as \nknowledge increases. More research is required aimed at developing \nbetter HIV treatments and diagnostics for poor people, children and \nwomen. Moreover, key elements of an effective response remain \nunknown, and the overall goal of controlling HIV globally will require the \ndevelopment of new technologies for prevention and treatment – including \nvaccines and microbicides.  These approaches will be consistent with \nbroader access to medicines strategies currently being developed. The \nglobal response should: \n \nEnsure stability and sustainability of commitment and resources  \n \n43. International experience shows that prevention efforts need to be \ncontinuous. Risk behaviour can rapidly increase if efforts are not \nmaintained and adapted to changing circumstances – even where there \nare high background levels of knowledge about preventive behaviour.  \nSimilarly, anti-retroviral treatment – including monitoring and adaptation of \ntreatment regimes – once started, needs to be sustained for life.  Even as \nnew strategies and technologies become available the international \ncommunity must work to ensure that these activities are maintained in \ntandem. \n \nIncrease our understanding of effective best practices \n \n44. Further research is needed aimed at increasing our understanding of \neffective best practices. This must be placed in the context of different \nenvironments and effectively targeted to the poor, women and \nmarginalised communities.  This will require ongoing research into the \ncultural, economic and policy determinants of vulnerabilities and risk for \nHIV infection and its consequences, and successful responses. \n \nDevelop better HIV treatments and diagnostics for poor people, children \nand women  \n \n45. Current Antiretroviral regimens are not a cure. Some communities will be \nunable to access expanding treatment efforts - or will become unable to \ncontinue to benefit due to drug resistance or side effects.  Responses \nshould support efforts to develop new treatment strategies that meet the \nneeds of the poor, as well as treatments for children with HIV/AIDS, whose \ntreatment needs have not been adequately addressed. \n \nAccelerate progress towards developing new technologies   \nAPRIL 2004 \nDEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT \n18 CONSULTATION DOCUMENT \nNOT UK GOVERNMENT POLICY \n \n \n \n46. Responses should support efforts to identify new technologies to prevent \nHIV.

In 1882 The South Staffordshire Regiment was ordered to march with Lord Wolseley to the relief of General Gordon who was besieged in Khartoum. They entrained at Cairo with their Staffordshire Bull Terrier \"Boxer\". Unfortunately Boxer leapt from the moving train and was seen lying unconscious or dead at the side of the track.\n\nA few days later when the Regiment encamped at Assiut awaiting orders for the final phase of their march, a very thin and bedraggled dog staggered into their camp and collapsed. Boxer had walked for over 200 miles along the scorching desert railway track to rejoin his regiment, a true soldier.\n\nFrom then on the tradition of having a Bull Terrier as a mascot continued with the battalions until after the Second World War. In 1949 the 6th Battalion the North Staffordshire Regiment were presented with a Bull Terrier for being the highest recruited infantry battalion in the Territorial Army.\n\nOn the 25th May 1949 the 6th North Staffords sent a Company size group (some 120 men) along with its Corps of Drums and Fifes to the Royal Tournament, which was held that year in Olympia. The mascot Watchman I was pure white in colour and showed little interest in the occasion until the Band and Drums struck up. At which point he raised his head and marched proudly to the thunderous applause of an appreciative audience who had immediately taken him to their hearts. Over the next decade Watchman I attended every parade in which the battalion took part and was presented to Her Majesty The Queen on her visit to Burton-on-Trent on 28th March 1957. He passed away in 1959 and was laid to rest in the lawns opposite the Town Hall in King Edward Square Burton-on-Trent.\n\nSuch was the tradition, interest and good feeling of the people of Burton towards this most popular mascot that in September 1960 Watchman II was presented to the Regiment by the town at a civic parade. Like his predecessor he was to march at the head of the Battalion throughout the next six years of his life and was presented to Her Majesty The Queen on the occasion of the Presentation of New Colours to the 6th North Staffords and 5th South Staffords, and a Guidon to the Staffordshire Yeomanry at Molineaux in the early 1960’s. His last parade was the Honorary Colonels Parade held at St Martins Camp in 1966. The following year the County TA Regiments were reformed and Watchman II went into retirement until his death in 1974 at the age of fourteen.\n\nHe was laid to rest alongside his predecessor at Burton where both are remembered on a commemorative plaque.\n\nThe 3rd Battalion The Staffordshire Regiment was raised in 1988 and it was felt that the time honoured tradition of having a mascot should continue. Consequently a search was made to find a dog with the suitable pedigree and bearing to do justice to the Regiment and County. As an indication of the depth of feeling within the County for the mascot, the people of Burton presented the Regiment with Watchman III in 1988. He served until his death in 1998 and was interred alongside his two predecessors.\n\nWatchman IV was presented to the Regiment as a puppy in August 1998 by the Friends of the Regiment and continues to parade with both the 1st Battalion and the newly formed West Midlands Regiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\nWhilst every effort has been taken to ensure the accuracy of this information, personnel must confirm details through the chain of command or with their Administrative Office before taking any action or making any commitment.\n\t\n\nLast Reviewed: 4 Nov 04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Whatever the ship may be up to, there will be members of the Supply Department at critical points in the action. This will be so whether firing a missile or landing a disaster relief party, or more routinely, entertaining dignitaries or despatching the Ship's mail. \n\n\n\nWhen a ship deploys abroad on an operational task, she sets out to execute a particular mission. It is the task of the Supply Department to ensure that she can remain \"on task\" for as long as is required to see this mission through to conclusion. If we have a product, it is best described as \"sustainability\" - ultimately that which ensures that when the Captain says \"fire\" he hears a \"bang\" and not a \"phut\"! \n\n\n\nTo achieve the range of support we are tasked to deliver, a team of multi-skilled personnel is called for to keep the business of the Ship running as smoothly as possible. It is worthy of note that this team is smaller than those in other classes of similar sized ships in the RN, whilst the overall capabilities of the Type 23 Frigate are much greater. \n\n\n\nOur \"heavy logisticians\" form the Naval Stores Sub Department. Known traditionally as \"Jack Dusties\", they look after the Ship's spare parts to support critical equipment. If a spare is to be held, they look after it, ready to lay their hands on it when required; if one is not, they will know how to obtain one, no matter where the Ship may be, within an acceptable timescale. At the last count, the team held some 41 589 items in their care, to the approximate value of £15M. In peacetime the Stores Accountants serve their customers from the \"tranquillity\" of the Stores Office. In war, (and much against their better judgement!) they fling the doors to the storerooms open to allow immediate access, so crucial to the sustainability of the operational effort. \n\n\n\nThe work of the Galley Staff may seem obvious. However the skill and planning required to cater for 170 hungry and discerning palates, for £1.90 per person per day, possibly for several months and without recourse to Sainsbury's, would focus the mind of any civilian chef! Again, their output varies directly with the Ship's tasking. They may one day be required to cater for an overseas lunch party for visiting dignitaries, hosted by the Captain, and quash the stereotypes of British Catering at a stroke! The next, they may be required to present a sustaining \"potmess\" to the Ship's Company, produced from scratch in less than forty minutes, to be consumed within the same timescale whilst the Ship remains at Action Stations. \n\n\n\nThe staff of the Ship's Office are responsible for most of the other things closest to a sailor's heart beyond food, such as pay, leave, travel and tobacco coupons! Add to this custody of large quantities of cash, in a variety of currencies, and the management of the Ship's correspondence, internal and external, and you have a self filling in tray, a permanent queue of customers, and a lack of time off! \n\n\n\nThe remit of the Wardroom Management Staff far exceeds their traditional role. In addition to day to day management of the Wardroom, they are at the front end of any function in support of Defence Diplomacy, where their style and skill support our nation's enduring reputation abroad. They have also recently assumed accounting responsibility for the Ship's four internal funds that support the Ship's Mess communities. \n\n\n\nOur smallest, but nonetheless crucial Sub Department, is the NAAFI. The key function of its singleton manager has a unique impact on the Ship's sustainability in as much as it directly effects the morale of the Ship's Company. The importance of a Mars Bar as you secure from Action Stations is hard to put into words! \n\n\n\nIt is clear then that the unique requirements of Type 23 Supply Department reflect the range of roles of the Ship itself and span, in each discipline of our business, from routine delivery of quality services in peacetime, to fast reacting provision of life-sustaining functions in war.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\tTop of page \n\n\t\t\tPrint \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t© Crown Copyright 2004.

This paper\n      examines these associations by pooling results from eight large prospective\n      studies.\n\n\n      Bottom line\n\n\n      This paper finds that meat and dairy product consumption, in mid or later life,\n      is not associated with breast cancer risk (although it did not examine the effect\n      of the level to which meat is cooked or cooking method).\n\n\n      Reference\n\n\n      SA Missmer et al. Meat and dairy food consumption and breast cancer: a pooled\n      analysis of cohort studies. International Journal of Epidemiology 2002 31:\n      78-85.\n\n\n      Study selection\n\n\n      Studies were from the Pooling Project of Prospective Studies of Diet and Cancer.\n      To be included, studies had to have at least 200 cases of breast cancer; assessed\n      diet using a comprehensive food frequency questionnaire; and validated the\n      questionnaire. Eight studies were identified with a total of 351,041 women, 7,379\n      of whom were diagnosed with breast cancer over five to ten years of follow-up. Ages\n      ranged from 31 to 90 years.\n\n\n      The following were examined:\n\n\n      Meat\n\n\n      \tmain groups of red meat, white meat, and total meat products;\n\twithin red meat, sub-groups of organ products, processed meats, bacon\n        products, sausage products and two specific foods, ground beef and hot dogs;\n\twithin white meat, sub-groups of poultry, seafood, fish, shellfish and\n        eggs.\n\n\n\n      Dairy\n\n\n      \tmain groups of total dairy fluids and total dairy solids;\n\twithin total dairy fluids, sub-groups of milk products, low fat dairy fluids,\n        low fat non-fermented dairy fluids, high fat dairy fluids, high fat non-fermented\n        dairy fluids, fermented dairy fluids, yoghurt products and four specific foods,\n        skim and low fat milk, whole milk, whole cream and ice cream;\n\twithin total dairy solids, sub-groups of high fat dairy solids, fermented\n        dairy solids, cheese products and two specific foods, butter and cottage\n        cheese.\n\n\n\n      Individual foods were only examined when intake had been assessed in at least\n      five studies. The groups were analysed according to increments of 100g a day (or in\n      a few cases 10g a day when more appropriate) and as quartiles (for main and\n      sub-groups).\n\n\n      Results\n\n\n      Median total meat intake ranged from 25 g/day to 215 g/day between studies (half\n      chicken breast = 86 g); median egg intake from 5 to 22 g/day (1 egg = 50 g); dairy\n      fluids from 203 to 262 g/day (8 oz milk = 244 g); and dairy solids from 23 to 34\n      g/day (1 oz cheese = 28 g).\n\n\n      The results were adjusted for several variables (a total of 14) including age at\n      menarche, menopausal status at follow-up, age at first birth, family history of\n      breast cancer, smoking status, body mass index and alcohol intake.\n\n\n      No associations were found between total meat, red meat, white meat, total dairy\n      fluids, total dairy solids and risk of breast cancer.\n\n\n      For 100 g/day intake increments, the relative risks and 95% confidence intervals\n      were as follows: total meat 1.02 (0.97 to 1.08); red meat 0.98 (0.93 to 1.04);\n      white meat 1.02 (0.94 to 1.11); total dairy fluids 0.99 (0.97 to 1.00); total dairy\n      solids 1.03 (0.95 to 1.11).\n\n\n      Compared with the lowest quartiles of intake, the relative risks and 95%\n      confidence intervals for the highest quartiles were as follows: total meat 1.08\n      (0.98 to 1.19); red meat 0.94 (0.87 to 1.02); white meat 1.02 (0.91 to 1.13); total\n      dairy fluids 0.93 (0.84 to 1.03); total dairy solids 1.01 (0.93 to 1.09).\n\n\n      No associations were found between the meat or dairy sub-groups or specific meat\n      or dairy foods and risk of breast cancer, with the exception of egg consumption\n      (for 100 g/day increment, relative risk 1.22, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to\n      1.45).\n\n\n      Comment\n\n\n      Although an association was observed between egg consumption and breast cancer\n      risk, this association became inconsistent in further analyses, and it is possible,\n      even probable, that the association observed is due to chance. The probability of\n      finding significant results due to chance increases with the number of statistical\n      tests performed; and this analysis examined a large number of food groups and\n      specific foods.\n\n\n      Although no association was observed between meat consumption and breast cancer\n      risk, this paper was unable to assess the effect of cooking method or the level to\n      which meat is cooked (as the majority of studies did not collect this information).\n      For instance, meat cooked at high temperatures (e.g. frying and barbecuing) and\n      welldone meat (especially to the point of charring) contain heterocyclic amines,\n      known to be carcinogenic. However, the overall lack of association observed in this\n      paper suggests that generally, there are no adverse effects of meat in relation to\n      risk of breast cancer.\n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\t\n\tMore About Bandolier\n\n\t\n\tAbout Us \n\n\tfind out more about Bandolier and the team\n\n\n\tContact Us \n\n\tFind out how to contact us.\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\tWant a monthly email alert for what's new?\n\n\t Drop us a line.\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tWe're changing our site!

The focus was still on the 'Marching Season' with Drumcree in particular, in Northern Ireland, with the Battalion on standby ready to deploy in a Public Order role if required. However many Battalion and sporting events and activities have taken place in this  period...........\n\n\n\n\nOn Saturday the 30th June members of the 1st Battalions C (Charlie) Company paraded through the streets of Sherbourne, Dorset with bayonets fixed and with the Battalions Colours flying. They were joined by contingents of the Territorial Army Rifle Volunteers and the Army Cadet Force in exercising their freedom of the town.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe parade culminated with a Church service at Sherbourne Abbey followed by the Annual Regimental Reunuion.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\nThe Anti Tank (Milan) Platoon pictured below have been awarded the coveted title of the Duke of Kent’s Platoon having emerged as victors in the Inter Platoon competitions. The Platoon now proudly wears the Duke of Kent’s Platoon badge and wears a distinctive lanyard when in No 2's service dress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\nPicture above shows a member of the Anti Tank Platoon practicing weapon drills prior to the forthcoming shooting camp.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\nAll members of the 1st Battalion have been completing their annual military tests, ranging from the Law of Armed Conflict, 1st Aid training, through to zeroing their new SA80 A2 Individual weapons in preparation for the Annual Personnel Weapons Test\n\n \n\n\n\t\n\n\n\nPictured above is Lcpl Si Jenkins who is carrying out individual Chemical Decontamination drill.\n\n\n \n\nExercise Elsinore Finn\n\nPrior to departing Niorthern Ireland, 8 Members of the 1st Battalion took part in Exercise Elsinore Finn , a 2 week Sky Diving Expedition to Lake Elsinore in California USA. The weather conditions where perfect with clear blue skies every day, perfect for Sky Diving. UK based expeditions are prone to poor weather conditions, thus preventing jumps taking place. All members of the 8 squad team completed at least 15 freefall jumps, including the novices who up till the exercise had never jumped from a plane before.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\nThe Sky Diving 8 team members.\n\n \n\nExercise Northern Midi\n\n9 members of the 1st Battalion have just spent 3 weeks in Southern France canoeing 240km of the Canal du Midi. The expedition included 12 consecutive days of paddling, with 20kms covered each day in approximately 6 hours.  The team spent each night in camp sites en route. After a hard 240km the team had earned their 2 days of rest and relaxation in Troulouse prior to the long journey (by minibus!) back to Catterick.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise True Grit\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\nPrivate Craig Hayes represented the 1st Battalion at the Army Endurance Motocross competition, Exercise True Grit. This is an annual event open to both miltary and civvilian riders.

The former landing ground at Hylton\n        used during World War One was in course of preparation as the squadron's\n        base, but it was not until September 1932 that any personnel could move\n        to the site. Next month a Gipsy Moth arrived to allow flying training\n        to commence, and in December the first Wapitis were received. These were\n        replaced by Demons. No 607 being redesignated a fighter squadron on 23\n        September 1936. In December 1938 conversion to Gladiators began and these\n        were taken to France in November 1939 to join the Air Component of the\n        BEF. In March 1940 Hurricanes began to arrive and within a few days of\n        the German invasion in May had completely replaced Gladiators. With its\n        airfields overrun, the squadron moved back to the UK to re-equip and\n        in September moved south to defend southern England during the Battle\n        of Britain. In October No.607 moved to Scotland returning south in August\n        1941 for fighter-bomber sweeps, the first taking place on 18 September.\n        In March 1942, the squadron left India and joined No.166 Wing at Alipore\n        on 25 May. At first engaged in escort and defensive duties, the squadron\n        converted to Spitfires in September 1943 and added ground attack missions\n        to its role. It flew Spitfires until the end of the Burma campaign, disbanding\n        on 19 August 1945. \n\n      On 10 May 1946, No.607 reformed at Ouston as a day fighter squadron\n        of the Auxiliary Air Force. After flying Spitfires for five years, it\n        converted to Vampires in October 1950 and was disbanded on 10 March 1957. \n\n      \n\n      A Rolls Royce kestrel V powered Hawker Demon of 607\n          Squadron.

          "EITI: CareEITI: Care\nEXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES TRANSPARENCY INITIATIVE (EITI) \nStatement from ConocoPhillips\nHenry I. McGee III, President, Europe and Africa, ConocoPhillips\nJune 17, 2003\nExtractive Industries Transparency Initiative Meeting\nLancaster House, London\nMadam Chairwoman, distinguished government officials, special guests, ladies and \ngentlemen, my name is Henry McGee, President of Europe and Africa for ConocoPhillips. I \nam pleased to be here today with this most august assembly to discuss this important issue.\nConocoPhillips is an international, integrated energy company, founded in 2002, following the \nmerger of Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Company. Combined, the new company has \nmore than 200 years of experience in the energy industry. The foundation of the new \ncompany is our legacy system of shared values, on which we are committed to setting the \nhighest standard of excellence in everything we do. In particular, our commitment to integrity \nand responsibility seem especially applicable to today’s meeting agenda. Simply put, we are \ncommitted to be ethical and trustworthy in our relationships with all stakeholders, we are \naccountable for our actions, and we make every effort to be a good neighbor and citizen in \nevery community in which we operate.\nConocoPhillips supports the principles of transparency overall, and in the particular, the efforts \nto increase transparency in payment and expenditure reporting from oil and gas production. \nWe believe that improved transparency in government revenues should be matched by full \ntransparency in government expenditures. We are willing to play a part in a responsible, \nvoluntary initiative, in cooperation with host governments as well as all private and state oil \ncompanies, and with the support of the international financial institutions. The Statement of \nPrinciples and Agreed Actions may provide a useful starting point for improving transparency \nover payments and revenues in the oil and gas industries.\nWe appreciate the work that has gone into this effort over the past year toward a balanced \nand workable framework to promote transparency of payments and revenues. We encourage \nclose study of other efforts by the OECD, the UN, IMF and others that has already been \naccomplished in this area, and incorporate lessons learned into the EITI process. We noted \nwith particular interest the G-8 Declaration on Fighting Corruption and Improving \nTransparency.\nWe hope that at the conclusion of this meeting a path forward to further clarification of the \nprocess will be defined and that all stakeholders – all extractive industry companies, \ngovernments, international organizations and non-government organizations – will commit to \nwork together for the benefit of the citizens in all our countries. \nBack to Top\nfile:///A|/eiti_draft_report_conoco.htm [29/07/04 11:52:48]\n",

CHOGMs are the pinnacle events in any Commonwealth calendar and take place every two years in a different country. CHOGMs bring together almost one third of the world's leaders, mostly Prime Ministers and Presidents. A CHOGM is arguably the only international forum where such a diverse group of countries come together to adopt common positions through consensus.\n\n\nCHOGM 2003\n\nThe theme of the present CHOGM, taking place from 5 to 8 December 2003 in Abuja, Nigeria, is 'Development and Democracy: Partnerships for Peace and Prosperity'.  For more information see the CHOGM 2003 website and the Commonwealth Secretariat website:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHOGM 2003\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Secretariat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Meeting of the Committee of the Whole (senior officials) usually takes place six weeks preceding CHOGM in London. Meetings in the margins of a CHOGM include the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) and the Ministerial Group on Small States. Parallel events involving non-government organisations, business and youth also take place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "Microsoft Word - 609800 \n190: Equity shares in social housing: literature review \n \nIntroduction  \nAn international literature review was conducted to further understand the processes associated \nwith asset accumulation and the potential impacts of applying such an approach through the \ndistribution of equity shares to social housing tenants in the UK.  \nKey findings  \n• Assets are essential for those on low incomes to escape poverty. Asset ownership allows \npeople the opportunity to participate as citizens and to contribute economically and socially \nin their communities and to society in general.  \n• Equity shares in social housing could go some way to help address asset and wealth \ninequality but there is a lack of understanding and certainty of the direct impact that asset \naccumulation has on the motivations and behaviour of individuals.  \n• Literature from the US finds that home ownership may generate positive impacts such as \nneighbourhood stability and community involvement. However, the evidence is far from \nconclusive and the US experience may not be directly transferable to the UK. The literature \nalso suggests that length of residence is more important than tenure per se in the \ndevelopment of social capital.  \n• The extension of home ownership to low income groups is not in itself sufficient to \ncounteract neighbourhood decline and deprivation. The extension of home ownership must \nbe pursued in tandem with wider regeneration initiatives.  \n• Literature on employee share ownership schemes finds that they are a marginal factor in \ninfluencing employees attitude and behaviour. However, the literature does indicate the key \nelements needed for the successful delivery of an equity share scheme, such as partnership \nand transparency.  \n• Individual Development Accounts matched savings accounts developed in the US to help \nlowincome families save and accumulate assets could be used as a model to deliver an \nequity share scheme in the UK.  \nBackground to the research  \nAsset building allows individuals the opportunity to make life-enhancing investments, including \nowning a home, undertaking home improvements, starting a business, moving into self \nemployment, or simply providing support for them or their children to access education and \ntraining. Equity shares in social housing can combine individual well-being with broader issues \nincluding wealth and asset inequality, promote equality and choice in housing and social justice, \ntackle financial exclusion and support community-based regeneration. Equity shares therefore:  \n• give social housing tenants an increased stake in their home and society;  \n• improve the wealth position of social tenants;  \n  \n• encourage social housing tenants to take greater interest in their homes and communities;  \n• help social housing tenants to move into home ownership.  \nTenure and Home Ownership in the UK \nHome ownership is an important form of asset accumulation, which provides future returns in \nwealth and income, not only for current owners but as an asset, which can be transferred between \ngenerations through inheritance. Home ownership does not guarantee a positive return on \ninvestment and does entail an element of risk-taking. However, as the dominant housing tenure in \nthe UK, owner-occupation provides financial and wealth-creating benefits that are not available to \nthose who pay rent, either in the social or private rented sectors. Put simply, those in the social \nhousing sector, who pay rent and undertake home improvements, do not necessarily benefit from \nthis outlay, by securing any future financial return or equity release, as tends to be the norm in the \nowner-occupier sector.  \nOwner-occupation has grown in the UK while social renting (particularly renting from local \nauthorities) has decreased. The UK has a higher than average level of owner-occupation in \ninternational terms being the sixth highest in the European Union. The social rented sector in the \nUK is different in composition and function from that in other comparable countries: it serves more \nas a social safety net for low income and vulnerable groups. These groups tend not to benefit from \nwealth creation and asset building opportunities afforded to other middle and higher income \ngroups.  \nThe composition of UK social housing has been influenced by government policy and the impact of \nRight-to-Buy (RTB) especially during the 1980s when some 1.5 million homes were sold through \nRTB. The effect has been an increasing polarisation of housing tenures with local authority rented \naccommodation being residualised and the profile of social renting tenants hollowed out and \nconsidered as the tenure of last resort.  \nEquity shares in social housing might have the desired effect of changing peoples perceptions, \nmaking social renting a more attractive option. This might be problematic as data suggests that \nsocial housing tenants are more likely to be economically inactive and to be on low-incomes than \nthose in other tenures. The poorest wards in England also contain a significantly higher proportion \nof social renters than other tenures. The social rented sector contains higher than average \nproportions of single parents, younger households and relatively few in the 45-64 year old age \ncohort. Black- Caribbean and Bangladeshi households are more likely to be social renters than \nother ethnic groups.  \nAssets and Financial Exclusion \nEvidence suggests that a significant degree of asset inequality exists in UK society and this \noverlaps with issues surrounding financial exclusion, poverty and deprivation more generally. \nResearch has shown that approximately 1.5 million households in Britain (7% of all households) do \nnot hold a current account, nor do they have any savings, credit or insurance. A further 4.4 million \n(20%) are considered to be on the margins of financial services. Those who are seen to be \nunbanked tend to be concentrated in areas of high deprivation. Lack of savings and assets and a \ntendency to experience financial exclusion are associated with a number of social, economic and \ndemographic characteristics that are common among social renting tenants. \nDespite the lack of engagement with mainstream financial services, many low-income households \ndo manage to save, often saving small amounts, through a variety of informal means. However, the \n  \nlack of formal pathways to asset accumulation and the problems associated with financial \nexclusion, does expose vulnerable and low-income households to additional risks and expense. \nResearch methods  \nTo address these issues a comprehensive review of a range of different data and information \nsources, including academic publications, research reports and government publications, was \nundertaken. A number of intellectual disciplines were covered in the review: economics, \nmanagement and business studies, regeneration and housing, psychology and behavioural studies. \nEarly on it became obvious that there was an overall lack of research and information on asset-\nbuilding in general and more specifically, on the use of equity shares as a policy option. To address \nthis problem, the research team accessed and reviewed literature and data from the USA, where the \nmajority of research on asset accumulation has been undertaken and work has been done to assess \nthe economic and social impacts of home ownership.  \nResearch findings \nTheoretical Perspectives on Asset Accumulation  \nAssets are a stock of resources accumulated and held in different forms, such as bank accounts \n(savings accounts), homes, stocks and shares and pensions. Wealth can be seen as the net worth of \nthe assets held by an individual or household.  \nAdvocates of asset-based welfare policy base the grounds for intervention on two principal \nobservations. First, economically, asset accumulation is essential to address poverty. For the vast \nmajority of low-income households, the pathway out of poverty is not through consumption but \nthrough savings and asset accumulation. Second, attitudinal effects: accumulation of assets lead to \nimportant psychological and social effects that are not achieved to the same degree by receiving \nand spending an equivalent amount of regular income.  \nThe research literature identifies the following psychological and social effects of asset holding:  \n• household economic stability;  \n• decreased economic strain on households;  \n• educational attainment;  \n• decreased marital dissolution;  \n• decreased risk of intergenerational poverty transmissions;  \n• increased health satisfaction among adults;  \n• increased property values;  \n• decreased residential mobility;  \n• increased levels of civic participation;  \n• existing theories of savings and asset accumulation may be classified into three broad \ncategories: economic theories, psychological and sociological, and behavioural theories.  \n  \nFor the most part, mainstream economic theory has ignored the savings behaviour of low-income \nhouseholds. As savings is determined as a residual left over after consumption has been satisfied, \nthe motivations for savings behaviour are assumed to be the same for both low-income households \nas it is for middle and high income households.  \nIn contrast to economic theories, psychological and sociological theories emphasise the notion of \npreferences and motivations and how savings behaviour is conditioned by attitudes and cultural \nnorms. Importantly, these approaches consider savings as a deliberate proactive decision, rather \nthan a residual form of consumption.  \nBehavioural theories combine some elements of both economic and psychological approaches to \nshow how individuals create their own incentives and constraints rather than just responding to \nexternal pressures.  \nThe institutional approach to savings, highlights the role of institutions formal and informal \nrelationships and rules in the process of asset accumulation. Institutional theories focus on the \nextent to which individuals savings behaviour is conditioned by the institutions through which they \nsave and that savings behaviour does respond to certain incentives. Four institutional variables are \nassumed to influence savings patterns and asset accumulation: access, information, incentives and \nfacilitation. Very simply, for those who have access to formal and structured savings opportunities, \nappropriate financial education, attractive savings incentives, and mechanisms of facilitation will \nsave a greater percentage of their income. In effect, those on low incomes will respond to \ninstitutional opportunities, incentives and disincentives, and given the right choices and structures, \nthey will save.  \nOne conclusion to be drawn from the review of the theoretical literature is the lack of knowledge \nand understanding of the precise impacts and effects that assets have on the behaviour and \nmotivations of individuals. More research is required to understand the incentives of asset \naccumulation, especially for lowincome households and the long term effects of asset accumulation \nand whether people would prefer to spend now any form of savings/assets/equity shares, over \nconsumption later because their present circumstances and needs are so pressing?  \nAsset Accounts - Incentive Schemes in Employment \nEmployee share ownership schemes (ESO) provide insights into the effects of incentives on \nindividual and collective perceptions, attitudes and behaviour.  \nThe literature review identified significant limitations with the evidence examining ESOs and \ncomplexities are raised when considering the many different types of ESO schemes and the various \nfunctions, which they can fulfil. Overall, share ownership appears to be a marginal factor \ninfluencing employees attitudes when compared to other issues (e.g. job security). However, \nindividual employees do not feel that they are in a position to affect share prices due to factors \nbeyond their control. ESO schemes have the greatest positive impact on employees attitudes when \nthey see direct financial benefits, and when they feel genuinely involved in company decision \nmaking.  \nKey lessons drawn from the research on ESO for equity shares include the following:  \n• the need for a partnership between tenants and landlords in operating such a scheme;  \n• the need to design behavioural conditions carefully;  \n• the need for clear eligibility rules and transparent administration;  \n  \n• the need for careful marketing and effective communication to heighten tenants \nunderstanding;  \n• the need to address the potential inequalities involved in conferring equity shares in high \ndemand compared to low demand areas.  \nIndividual Development Accounts \nThe majority of research on asset accounts, including Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) \nhas been undertaken in the USA. IDAs are matched savings accounts, designed to help low-income \nfamilies save and accumulate assets. The key goals for the use of IDAs include home ownership, \nmicroenterprise and education and training.  \nThere is growing international interest in IDAs. Distinct asset based initiatives are being discussed \nand implemented in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. In Canada, the Government is sponsoring \na major IDA demonstration project, Learn$ave, to assist low-income Canadians to build their \npersonal savings and access educational opportunities. Taipei, Taiwan, and the Bureau of Social \nServices has launched a privately funded, three year IDA initiative. Pilot IDA projects are \nbeginning to emerge in Sweden, Mexico, Singapore and Puerto Rico.  \nAt the time of the research there were over 250 communities across the USA with IDA \nprogrammes, with another 100 in development. The American Dream Demonstration (ADD) is the \nfirst large-scale test of IDAs and will run for a five-year period. Key lessons identified through \ninterim evaluations of IDAs programmes and the ADD include the following:  \n• improves access to financial services for low-income families and marginalised groups \nethnic minorities, women;  \n• helps to raise awareness of the importance of money management, financial literacy and \neducation;  \n• supports high return quality of life investments, such as education and training, self-\nemployment and home ownership;  \n• alters the behaviour and perceptions of individuals and family members towards a culture of \nsaving and investing in their own futures; and  \n• stimulates enterprise creation through support for micro-enterprises.  \nWhile the final evaluation of the national IDAs demonstration project is still to be completed, there \nis limited evidence on the impacts that IDAs have on peoples perceptions and behavioural patterns. \nEvidence from one evaluation of an IDA programme indicates positive benefits from the use of \nIDAs. Further analysis is required but there is scope to investigate ways in which an IDA \nprogramme could be used as a model to support equity shares in social housing in the UK context.  \nAssessing the Impacts of Asset Accumulation and Home Ownership \nThe majority of claims regarding the effects of home ownership and the empirical evaluations of \nthese, tend to come from the USA. While there are positive benefits from home ownership, there \nare important political, policy and cultural differences between America and the UK regarding \ntenure. Although a high proportion of British householders aspire to owner occupation, this tenure \ndoes not have the same intensity of attraction which it has acquired in the United States.  \n  \nIn purely economic terms, home ownership generally appears to be a good investment for \nhouseholds which provides a solid return, particularly for middle and upper income groups. \nResearchers have found that home ownership significantly reduced the selfperceived economic \nstresses of blue-collar employees. Nevertheless, an important qualification to this is added by one \nof the few British studies in this area, which warns of the potential for lower returns on investment \nand even negative equity for low-income home owners.  \nThe social benefits attributed to home ownership include higher levels of property maintenance and \nhouse price values, increased neighbourhood stability, improved neighbourhood relations, less anti-\nsocial behaviour and accretions of social capital. However, it has to be noted that the experience in \nthe USA may not be directly applicable to the British experience due to important cultural and \nhistorical differences in housing provision.  \nEvidence from a number of American studies indicates that, in the right circumstances, home \nownership does have positive effects for individuals and communities. However, much of this is \nattributable to the greater length of tenancy associated with home ownership in America, and the \nnature of the American rented sector may not be directly comparable to social housing in the UK. \nEven where the evidence from America does suggest that home ownership has a positive impact on \nhousehold well-being, community involvement, neighbourhood stability and social capital, the \nqualification must be added that neighbourhood conditions may reduce these impacts.  \nThe policy implications for an equity shares programme in the UK are not clear-cut from the \nresearch into the effects of owner occupation. One interesting finding is that the length of residence \nrather than tenure per se may be a decisive factor in the development of social capital.  \nCommentators have argued that, even if the individual and social benefits of home ownership can \nbe shown, this might not be a suitable tenure for all households, particularly where this relates to \nlower income households in depreciating housing markets or areas of economic and social decline. \nExtending home ownership will not in itself be sufficient to counteract the conditions of \nneighbourhood decline and deprivation. However, the asset accumulation dimension of equity \nshares could form a basis for the asset accumulation of the human and cultural capital required to \nassist households in such areas. To succeed, any policy to promote the extension of home \nownership to low-income families should bear in mind that home ownership strategies need to be \nintegrated with other regeneration and community regeneration initiatives.  \nConclusions  \nThere is growing policy interest in asset-based welfare policy, not only as a response to growing \nwealth and asset divisions within society but more generally.  \nAssets are essential to those on low incomes if they are to escape poverty asset ownership allows \npeople the opportunity to participate as citizens and to contribute, economically and socially in \ntheir communities and to society in general.  \nBased on an assessment of the current literature, it can be said that asset-building policy helps to \npromote individual financial stability and well being, home ownership, lifelong learning, economic \ndevelopment and small business creation, social justice, financial inclusion and sustainable \nneighbourhood regeneration.  \nEquity shares in social housing is an option for tenants to secure a financial stake in their own home \nand to acquire the same opportunities for asset accumulation, that are afforded to those in owner \noccupation.  \n  \nThere are gaps in our knowledge and understanding concerning asset building policies and how \nequity shares in social housing could promote asset accumulation through home ownership. While \nthe research evidence comes mainly from the USA, more detailed investigation of these issues from \na UK and European perspective would be beneficial for policy development.  \nFurther research is required to understand the role of incentives for asset accumulation, especially \nfor lowincome households.  \nLongitudinal and cross-sectional data gathering and analysis is required to ascertain the direct \nimpacts of IDA policy on the motivations, behaviour and attitudes towards savings and asset \naccumulation.  \nNot withstanding these problems there is scope to further research the linkages between an IDA \nprogrammes approach supporting or delivering equity shares in social housing.  \nFurther information is contained in the full report Equity Shares in Social Housing: Literature \nReview, ISBN 1 85112 644 9, £12.  \nFurther information \nFurther copies of this summary are available from: \nHousing Support Unit (HSU) \nOffice of the Deputy Prime Minister \nZone 2/C6 \nEland House \nBressenden Place \nLondon SW1E 5DU \nFax no. 020 7944 4527 \nE-mail: h.r.summaries@odpm.gov.uk \nInformation on how and where you can obtain these documents and other publications produced by \nthe Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is available from the ODPM publications home page. \n \n \n",

The NHMF is also responsible for the distribution of the heritage share of the proceeds from the National Lottery which it does via the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF). The HLF gives financial help to projects which safeguard improved access to land, buildings, objects and collections of importance to the national heritage of the UK. It can also provide support for projects which produce wider public benefits in terms of education, access and urban regeneration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Links\n \n Email the Prime Minister\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSend an email to Prime Minister Tony Blair\n\t\t\t\t\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrime Minister's Questions\nWatch Prime Minister's Questions live here every Wednesday Parliament is in session\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tFrequently Asked Questions\nAnswers to our most frequently asked questions\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLearn about the Cabinet\nLearn more about the Ministers who make up the Cabinet and its famous history\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUseful Links\nUseful links to other government sites\n\n \n\n\n\n\n|\n\t\t\tcopyright | contact the webteam | website feedback | privacy policy | advanced search | sitemap | accessibility | rss feed | \n\n\n\n\n",

We were joined on passage by Commodore Fanshawe, Commodore Devonport Flotilla, who spent 4 days with us and spoke at length to most personnel on board.  A relatively small island, Nassau is a favourite with cruise liners and those who enjoy a bit of a flutter.  A number of the Ship’s Company took this opportunity to relax after our longest period at sea and some even managed to sail with more money that they had when they arrived!\n\n\n\nBack at sea we were fortunate enough to embark Lt Jude Terry from HMS Collingwood who spent two days giving presentations to the Ship’s Company on everything from pensions to the Divisional System.  Having landed her in Jamaica we then continued with our counter-drugs operations, finding time for a few quiz nights and NBC training along the way.  En route to Grand Cayman we were joined by Captain Brown RN, Captain Surface Ships of the Devonport Flotilla.\n\n\n\nGrand Cayman was our next port of call and we anchored just off George Town on 21 May.  Using a boat for transfers we were able to get people ashore and also to bring on probably our largest number of guests for the cocktail party that night.  Things didn’t proceed quite as smoothly as we would have hoped and as the wind changed direction just after midnight we were forced to sail at short notice.  The remainder of the visit was spent steaming up and down approximately a mile off the coast.  However, the boat routines enabled most people to get ashore and enjoy a very beautiful island.\n\n\n\n\n\n13 Jul update continued\nRead More ...\n\n\n\n\n\n© Crown Copyright 2004.

BANGOR is not equipped with a flight deck and therefore helicopters are unable to land on. She can however, make provision for a helicopter to hover above the aft deck and under the control of the HSO (Helicopter Safety Officer) Lt Alan ‘DOLLY’ Parton winch down persons or stores.\n\n\n\n The winch wire must be earthed as a helicopter if flight generates massive amounts of static electricity. This job falls to the Buffer LOM (MW) Al Gibb here seen holding the earthing pole. Anything winched down is under the direction of OM (MW) Smiler Morton who will remove from the flying area and it escort away. The ultimate safety rests with the HSO but the three-man team work closely together to ensure a safe and trouble free transfer. Who knows the next flying serial could be mail transfer, always a welcome evolution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\tTop of page \n\n\t\t\tPrint \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t© Crown Copyright 2004.

They are equipped with the most formidable fighting vehicles in the world, from the battle-proven Challenger tank to the fast Scimitar reconnaissance vehicle.\n\nOf these 12 regiments, six are equipped with Challenger 2 and four with the Scimitar. The Joint Nuclear Biological and Chemical Regiment with the 1st Royal Tank Regiment, provide the British Armed Forces with the ability to detect hazardous materials in any environment. \n\t\n\n\t\nThe Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment is famous for the many ceremonial duties that it carries out in London including the state opening of Parliament. All Household Cavalrymen are dual trained; on horseback and in the formation reconnaissance role.\n\nEvery Regiment in the Corps takes pride in its own history and traditions. The winning combination of the skills of a Royal Armoured Corps soldier and his advanced, battle-proven equipment result in an exciting and varied challenge that shows modern soldiering at its best.\n\nTo find out more about each of the twelve regiments go to the links at the top of the page and click on the capbadges. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\nWhilst every effort has been taken to ensure the accuracy of this information, personnel must confirm details through the chain of command or with their Administrative Office before taking any action or making any commitment.\n\t\n\nLast Reviewed: 6 Aug 03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "PMOS afternoon briefing - 24 June\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\tPRESS BRIEFING: 3.45PM TUESDAY 24 JUNE 2003\n\nIRAQ\n\nThe Prime Minister's Official Spokesman (PMOS) informed journalists of two incidents earlier today near Al Amarah in Iraq, which had resulted in British casualties. He said we very much regreted to confirm that in one incident, six British personnel had been killed. Arrangements were in hand to inform their next of kin. In the second incident, troops from 1 Para patrolling south of Al Amarah had come under fire. The patrol had taken one casualty and two vehicles had been destroyed. In responding to the incident, an RAF Chinook helicopter, carrying a Quick Reaction Force, had come under fire as it landed. Seven personnel on board the helicopter had been wounded, three of them seriously. All had been extracted by helicopter and were receiving treatment. The MoD was investigating the incidents, including whether or not they were related. The Government would provide more information when we could, but we asked the media to respect the fact that our priority was to ensure that next of kin were informed as quickly as possible. The Defence Secretary would update the House of Commons as soon as possible. The PMOS added that the Prime Minister had been due to meet the Defence Secretary, Foreign Secretary and Secretary of State for International Development later today in any event to discuss post-Saddam Iraq issues. That meeting would still go ahead and would take in the latest incidents. Asked whether they would discuss issues relating to security, the PMOS pointed out that security had always formed a central part of discussions about Iraq post-Saddam. Post-conflict reconstruction issues were as much about security as they were about water, education, oil and the like.\n\nQuestioned as to whether Al Amarah was known to be a dangerous area, the PMOS said that as he understood it, it was an area which was some distance north of Basra. There had always been a residual threat from hostile Iraqis since the end of offensive operations in Iraq. Security had been improving since the Iraqi police force had begun to be re-established and patrols had been carried out alongside UK forces. However, there had been sporadic attacks in the past which, as today showed, could not be entirely predicted or prevented.\n\nAsked if the first incident had been the result of hostile Iraqi action, the PMOS said that investigations were continuing. Asked if he was implying there was a possibility it could have been a friendly-fire incident, the PMOS repeated that investigations were continuing into what had happened. However, he wouldn't encourage journalists down that route.\n\nIn answer to further questions, the PMOS said that the Prime Minister had been informed of the two incidents during this morning and then over lunchtime. He had heard the news with great sadness. It went without saying that he believed those who had died had died with honour, doing a very worthwhile job and serving their country with great distinction.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\tPMOS afternoon briefing - 24 June\n\n\n",

          "Microsoft Word - princes royal trust for carers.docYoung carers (young people under the age of 18 who take on\nresponsibilities for looking after someone in their family) are\nparticularly likely to be affected by alcohol misuse. Many young\ncarers are in a caring role for a parent who misuses alcohol. Young\nCarers Projects are the specialist service for this group, providing\nbreaks, clubs, mentoring and family support, but they are able to\nwork most effectively where they have a good relationship with their\nlocal substance misuse support agencies. Unfortunately, many agencies\nwhich support adults with drinking problems are better at focusing\non their clients as individuals than on their clients as parents and\nfamily members. Alcohol support workers will often be unaware of the\ncaring role being taken on by their client's children, which can\nbegin at ages as young as 5 and can involve emotional support,\nclearing up after binges, looking after younger siblings and all the\nhousehold chores. The effects on young carers can include isolation,\nsocial exclusion, failure at school, bullying and ill health. As a\nresult, young carers can grow up to be socially excluded adults at\nrisk of substance misuse themselves.\nMost Young Carers Projects take a whole-family approach to supporting\nyoung carers; it is essential that other agencies adopt this approach\nas well.\nMy organisation is a network of 61 Young Carers Projects UK-wide. If\nyou would like examples of where joint-working has been effective and\nwhere it has not, I would be happy to help.\nYours,\nAlex Fox, Young Carers Development Co-ordinator\nThe Princess Royal Trust for Carers\n",

Bill Rammell, Foreign Office Minister, welcomed the innovation, saying:\n\n\n\n'The new postcode being introduced today will help reduce delays in the direction of mail to the Islands. Falkland Islands inhabitants often find that their letters have transited the postal systems of places such as the Faroe Islands, Iceland or the most popular destination for lost Falklands mail, Falkirk in Scotland. The postcode should also make on-line shopping easier for Falklands residents, given that most Internet-purchasing services require a post or zip code before transactions can be completed.

          "Homelessness statistics: September 2002 and domestic violence  TITLE  \\* MERGEFORMAT  Homelessness statistics: September 2002 and domestic violence \n\n\nHomelessness statistics: September 2002 and domestic violence\nContents\n\nHomelessness statistics 2002\t2\nPriority need groups\t2\nSingle homelessness\t4\nIntroduction\t5\nThe impact of domestic violence\t6\nThe links between homelessness and domestic violence\t6\nWhy should domestic violence lead to repeat homelessness?\t7\nWhat does this mean for services?\t8\nA new approach to homelessness\t12\nCross Government activity on domestic violence\t13\n \n\nHomelessness statistics 2002 \nThe homelessness statistics represent the number of households who approached local authorities and were found to be homeless through no fault of their own and to have a priority need for help.\n\nBetween July and September 2002, 33,640 households were accepted for re-housing by local authorities. This figure has gone up by 10% since the last quarter and is 9% higher than this time last year. 64% of all households were families with children or households containing a pregnant woman. \n\nAt the end of September 2002, there were 84,800 households living in temporary accommodation - an increase of 4% on the previous quarter and an increase of 9% compared to this time last year. Although the number of families with children in B&B hotels has remained at around 6,500 for the second quarter running, the overall number of households in B&B hotels has increased by 7%.\n\nNationally, parents, family or friends no longer being able or willing to provide accommodation remained the biggest reason given for loss of a settled home, accounting for 34% of homelessness acceptances.  A further 23% of acceptances were a result of relationship breakdown, of which seven out of 10 cases were homeless because of domestic violence. \n\nBlack and minority ethnic communities continue to be over-represented among those accepted as homeless. Between July and September 2002, of the 33,640 households accepted as homeless, over 8,000 were from a black or minority ethnic background. \nHomelessness varies widely across the country. London accounts for 24% of the total number of homelessness acceptances nationally. This quarter the number of homelessness acceptances in Yorkshire and the Humber region rose by 35%. The North West has the third highest level of homelessness acceptances.  \n\nPriority need groups\n\nPriority need groups are families with dependent children, households including a pregnant woman and people who are vulnerable in other ways, such as mental or physical health problems or for other special reasons. Of the 10% increase in acceptances this quarter, the majority are families with children and pregnant women, accounting for 44% of the increase, and people with physical and mental health problems and old age, accounting for 16%. \n\nFrom 31 July 2002, the Government strengthened this safety net to include homeless 16 or 17 year olds and 18 to 20 year old care leavers; people who are vulnerable as a result of time spent time in institutions; and people vulnerable as a result of having to flee their home because of violence. However, most of the increases over the last quarter were within existing priority need categories.  \n\nThe number of people accepted as vulnerable because they are young (a category that now encompasses the new priority need groups of 16/17 year olds and 18/20 year old care leavers) accounts for 9% of the total increase this quarter.  \n\n2,770 households were in priority need for other reasons, (a mix of existing and new categories). Out of these, 2,160 households were recorded as being accepted under the existing priority need category 'other special reason'; 460 households were accepted in the new priority need category of vulnerability due to fleeing violence (other than domestic violence); and 160 were accepted in the new priority need group of people who are vulnerable as a result of time spent in institutions.\n\n The Homelessness Directorate allocated an additional £10 million to local authorities in 2002-03 to enable them to respond to their new responsibilities under the Priority Need Order 2002. Local authorities are generally using the money imaginatively on a range of projects to prevent homelessness as well as meeting immediate need.\n109 local authorities will increase the amount of suitable accommodation available to vulnerable groups. \n\n72 will improve the provision of advice and information on homelessness in their areas. \n\n84 will increase the resources available to their homelessness teams to provide a better, quicker service.\n\n86 will provide further support specifically aimed at young people.\n\n68 will establish a rent deposit type scheme or build on an existing scheme to help people access the private rented sector. \n\n54 will provide a higher level of tenancy sustainment and floating support.\n\n31 will establish or build on existing mediation schemes, particularly aimed at young people and families.\n\n Single homelessness\nThe Homelessness Directorate recently asked some local authorities around the country to conduct a pilot survey of single homeless people using hostels, day/advice centres and other services during one week in November 2002.\n\nAlthough it should be emphasised that the survey findings are not representative of single homeless people across the country, they provide us with some indication about their profile and backgrounds. \n\nIn a sample of over 1,400 people:\n\n77% were male.\n\n29% were aged between 18 to 25 years old and 38% were aged between 25 to 39 years old. \n\n84% were of White-British ethnic origin. 6% were Black.\n\nWhen asked where they has stayed the night before 41% said in hostels, 21% with families and friends, 14% sleeping rough, 9% were living in their own accommodation and 3% were squatting.  \n\n29% had been in prison, 15% in local authority care and 5% in the Army.\n\nLocal authority statistics published in September shows that around 600 people are sleeping rough on any one night. This is around two-thirds lower than the nearly 2,000 recorded in 1998 and indicates that the target on reducing the number of people sleeping rough by two thirds has been maintained.\n\n Introduction\n\nHomelessness is a complex issue which affects children as well as adults. It is as much about a woman and her children being pursued by a violent man from one address to another as it is about the public image of a person sleeping in a cardboard box.\n\nDomestic violence is perhaps one of the most complex of homelessness issues. It is a significant feature of the experience of homelessness for many women and their children. Over the last seven years, more than 130,000 homeless households have been re-housed by local authorities because of domestic violence. It accounts for around 16% of homelessness acceptances every year. It is an enduring feature of homelessness. \n\nIt is also emerging as a major factor for people who experience repeat homelessness. Indeed it is likely that a proportion of the 130,000 homeless households re-housed over the past seven years are actually the same households who have lost their homes more than once. \n\nThis briefing brings together the most recent research and information about homelessness and domestic violence, and what is know about current accommodation and support services. It explains how domestic violence and its effects can cause a cycle of homelessness, what happens to people who are escaping violence and why an understanding of this is critical for the way that homelessness services are delivered.\n\nCarol\n\nCarol is 21 year old with a daughter aged five. As a child, Carol and her mother spent many months living with friends. Her father was violent and, although he was not physically abusive to Carol, she did witness the abuse her mother suffered and was scared all the time.\n\nCarol had been living with her partner for six years but his violence towards her got worse and worse as the years went by. Her daughter witnessed her being beaten although was not abused herself.\n\nCarol left twice during this period but on both occasions her partner pursued her. She went back to him on both occasions believing he would change, but also because she felt that she could not cope alone. Although she found it hard to talk about what was happening to her, she did talk to her GP with whom she has stayed in contact with.\n\nCarol found the frequent moving around very difficult and desperately hopes that she will not have to move again too soon as in the last six months, her daughter has already missed a month of school.\n\nShe currently lives in a supported hostel in the Midlands. She now feels that with the right support she can stand-alone and make a life for herself and her daughter.\n The impact of domestic violence\n\nDomestic violence accounts for around a quarter of all recorded crime and two incidents of domestic violence are reported to the police every minute. It claims the lives of two women a week. Nearly half of all female murder victims are killed by a partner or ex partner. 35 per cent of murders in the last five years have been a consequence of domestic violence. It has the highest rate of repeat victimisation of any crime - that is to say that violence is rarely a one off event. Statistics show women are physically abused an average between 30 and 35 times before they take action.\n\nDomestic violence affects all kinds of women; it is not confined to any social class, ethnic origin, or particular age. Although men too experience domestic violence, women are more likely to experience domestic violence at some point in their lives, more likely to experience repeat victimisation, more likely to be injured and to seek medical help, more likely to experience frightening threats and more likely to be frightened and upset. \n\nDomestic violence has profound physical, social, and psychological effects on those who experience it. However, these effects vary according to the types of violence and abuse a woman is exposed to and on the quality and consistency of the support she has.\n\nDomestic violence is a significant cause of permanent injury, disability and even death as well as chronic pain and internal injury. Risks of domestic violence increase with pregnancy and, with many women suffering miscarriages, stillbirths and foetal abnormalities.\n\nPsychological effects include guilt and low self-esteem. Incidents of mental health problems, anxiety and depression, as well as post traumatic stress are known to be greater among women who have experienced domestic violence.\n\nChildren are also deeply affected by domestic violence. One study has suggested that children are present in around two thirds of households that experience violence . Many children are abused themselves, either emotionally or physically.\n\nThe links between homelessness and domestic violence\n\nFor some, escaping domestic violence will involve leaving the family home - often as the last resort. In these circumstances a woman and her children are double victims. Leaving home can be an immediate response to a crisis situation or a more planned response to a long period of abuse or violence.\n\nFor women living in poverty or who are financially dependent on an abuser, a decision to leave home is likely to be more difficult because of the fear of not being able to find an alternative for themselves and their children. Women in these circumstances are more likely to rely on local authorities or other agencies for help.  \n\nWhen women decide to leave, they will need access to safe secure accommodation, either temporarily while they consider their options or permanently. Women's refuges have for many years provided places of safety and security for women and their children in crisis. But women fleeing their home also seek help from local authorities for help under the provisions of the homelessness legislation. \n\nThe official figures record the number of households who having approached local authorities are accepted as being homeless and having a priority need (usually children in the family, pregnancy or some form of vulnerability). And these official figures are likely to be an under-estimate of those who lose their homes because of domestic violence. Many other women turn to family or friends as an immediate respite from violence and may only later make an application as homeless. In these cases, the recorded reason for the loss of home would be that they could no longer stay with family or friends.\n\nStudies of homeless families over the years have shown how significant a problem domestic violence is: \n\n38% of families using Shelter's Homeless to Home projects had lost their home through domestic violence, based on both local authority figures and the family's interpretation of their situation . \n\nA study of families at a homeless centre in Birmingham found that nine out of ten families were homeless because of violence and that in 69% of cases the perpetrator was a partner or former partner .\n\nThe Bleinheim Project in Bradford provides supported housing services for homeless women with and without children. In 2001/2 39% of their clients were homeless because of domestic violence. In the first five months of this year, 47% of women accommodated were fleeing domestic violence.\n\nAlthough it may be the case that the nature of the projects means they are more likely to be used by women who have been through traumatic experiences, it does reveal how much domestic violence is part of the homelessness experiences of many people.\n\nAs well as being a direct and underlying cause of homelessness, domestic violence also appears to be a strong factor for those who experience 'repeat' homelessness. The main study of repeat homelessness among people who approach their local authority for help was carried out in Scotland. Based on a survey of 4,000 applications in 25 local authority areas, it found that around 27% of homelessness applications were 'repeat' presenters . \n\nPat\n\nTwenty-nine year old Pat was taken into care as a teenager after suffering physical and sexual abuse from her mother. She met her first partner when she was 15 and he was18 years old. The violence started soon after they began to live together.\n\nShortly after her son's birth her partner went into prison for two years and she began a relationship with another man who was also violent. Pat moved to Wales to escape, staying in a succession of refuges. She attempted suicide several times and was afraid of telling people about what had happened to her in case they thought she was a bad mother.\n\nShe was re-housed but her first partner found out where she was living. Fear of living alone and the difficulties of coping without family and friends made her take him back.\n\nAfter the birth of their daughter, the violence started again. After her son was also physically abused, she decided to leave and moved to a refuge before finally moving to Yorkshire. The family had four addresses in two years. Pat and her children were placed in a local authority hostel. After three months they moved into a council property in the centre of town. Although she is no longer taking the anti-depressants, which she took for a number of years, Pat has a difficult relationship with her children because she finds it difficult to show them affection. She\n\nalso fears that she will in turn become an abuser to her own children. Neither children are reading at the level expected by the schools and have missed at least three months of school in the last year. Both children have spent short periods in foster care over the last three years to give Pat a break.\nWhy should domestic violence lead to repeat homelessness? \n\nIn some ways this has an obvious answer. It frequently takes many attempts to leave an abusive relationship; women can become trapped in a cycle of domestic violence, being pursued by violent partners and returning to the family home. And crucially, the longer-term emotional and psychological effects of domestic violence and mobility can prevent women and their children from resettling after re-housing.\n\nDomestic violence has the highest rate of repeat victimisation of any crime. A perpetrator may pursue the woman and her family, forcing them to move again. Over 40% of women who reported having been a victim of domestic abuse were not living with their abuser at the time of the assault . Linda, one of the women interviewed for this report and her children had moved 23 times in seven years.\n\nOne woman described the life of her family who had had been re-housed: \"My husband has followed us, so it's all started again. I'm sick of running from houses all the time, we've been in refuges and hostels. It's no life for the kids. It takes them half an hour to pack their stuff and we'd be out the door. That's how much they are used to it.\" \n\nRecognising, accepting and leaving abuse is a lengthy and difficult process. Any intimate relationship means that people's lives become entwined and women may leave their abusive partner and return many times over. Leaving a husband or partner can also isolate a woman from her family and community, so removing her only source of support. It has been estimated that it takes around 6 attempts for abused women to leave their partner. Of those women who left refuges in 1997/8, at least one in five returned to their abusers. \n\nThe experience of being placed in temporary accommodation - bed and breakfast, or a hostel, a long way from the family home, requiring the children to change schools and move away from their friends, important stabilising influences for the children, may seem too traumatic. Children may become unsettled in a new environment and women may feel vulnerable and exposed. In such cases, it may seem a better option to return home.\n\nIn some cases, homeless women who have led unsettled lives, perhaps experiencing abuse or neglect in their own childhood, and experiencing violent and unstable relationships in adult life, are unable to settle down. Typically they have few social networks and find it difficult to form and sustain relationships. Isolation, the practical problems of moving into a new home with few possessions and little money, children's behaviour, the appearance of a previous partner or disputes with a neighbour can leave them unable to cope and many will leave again, repeating the cycle of homelessness. \n\nLinda\n\nLinda is 35 years old and has three daughters, aged 12, nine and eight. She is currently living in a privately rented house in the North West and is waiting to move into a property she is buying.\n\nLinda's childhood was spent in and out of care having suffered sexual abuse. As an adult, Linda has been in a violent marriage for 13 years. She became homeless for the first time seven years ago and moved to a refuge. Since then, she and the children have had 23 addresses having been pursued relentlessly by her husband.\n\nFinally, two years ago, after getting back together with him for the seventh time she decided she would not go back even when he found her. Since that decision she has found it difficult to settle down and has still moved a few times - she would \"just put the keys through the letter box and move on\". She reached what she describes as \"rock bottom\", and felt suicidal. Through a health visitor, she was referred to a community psychiatric nurse who has helped her to put roots down somewhere for the first time.\nWhat does this mean for services?\nDomestic violence is first and foremost a crime and stopping domestic violence and bringing perpetrators to justice is the over-riding priority. Health and social services, community safety and crime reduction programmes all have a critical role in tackling domestic violence. At a local level, a range of initiatives and partnerships are well established through crime and disorder strategies, and domestic violence forums. \n\nHowever, domestic violence is a significant feature in homelessness. Understanding more about domestic violence gives greater intelligence about homelessness itself, so that better interventions can be developed to prevent homelessness and to avoid its recurrence. \n\nThe availability of safe secure accommodation for women, either as a respite or as a stepping stone to re-housing is critical and potentially life saving. Refuges across the country have an important role to play in the provision of safe accommodation at a time of crisis for women and their children. In 1998, there were 2,715 spaces for households in refuges in England . Recent data from Supporting People analysis indicates there are now approximately 3,772 household spaces in England . While there are some differences in the way data was collected, the overall trend is upward. \n\nRegion\nHousehold spaces in women's refuges \nRegional provision as % of all provision\n\nEast Midlands\n300\n8\n\nEastern\n348\n 9\n\nLondon\n777\n21\n\nNorth East\n151\n 4\n\nNorth West\n549\n15\n\nSouth East\n581\n15\n\nSouth West\n343\n 9\n\nWest Midlands\n474\n13\n\nYorkshire & the Humber\n249\n 7\n\nTotal England\n3,772\n100%\n\nSource: End September 2002 Supporting People supply reporting\nHowever, refuge provision is neither the only, nor the main source of accommodation for homeless women and their families. In March 1999, there were over 7,000 households living in temporary accommodation who were homeless because of domestic violence . While there was considerable variation at a regional level, only 15% were in refuges. The rest were living in other forms of temporary accommodation - 25% were staying with friends and relatives; 30% were in temporary council or housing association properties; 13% were in hostels and 6% were in Bed and Breakfast hotels.\n\nWith around 40% of domestic assaults carried out by perpetrators living outside the home, many women will want to remain their homes if their security can be assured.  A number of crime reduction initiatives have focused on measures to improve home and personal security to achieve this. Women who elect to stay in their home have generally felt they made the right decision  although, in addition to security issues, a number of practical problems also need to be addressed in order to enable women to remain in their homes - such as dealing with ex-partner rent arrears and revising tenancy agreements. Advice and assistance in these areas are crucial and women receiving such help found the support they received from agencies invaluable. \n\nThe Sanctuary Project\n\nThe London Borough of Harrow has set up a new scheme to provide additional security measures for domestic violence victims to prevent homelessness. The scheme works operates in conjunction with the local domestic violence forum and the Police.\n\nPolice attending incidents offer the service to women where appropriate and also offer an outreach worker from Women's Aid to talk through their options. Crime prevention officers make recommendations for appropriate safety measures. Crucial to the service is that the works are carried out quickly to retain the client's confidence. The scheme is voluntary and available to women living in any tenure.\n\nIn addition to the provision of new and extra locks and lighting, a 'secure sanctuary' is created in the home converting a bedroom into a safe room through reinforcing doors and placement of bolts. Personal alarms and the provision of police mobile phones are also included as well as a help line for women to find out about the scheme.\nWomen and children will need a range of support, as they will use different services at different times according to their needs. Most refuges provide a core set of support services to their residents and certain services to ex residents. However, since the majority of homeless households who are escaping domestic violence are not staying in refuge accommodation, it is particularly important that they have access to services, which provide them with support during this time. \n\nThe collection of data for Supporting People has provided, for the first time, information about the availability of support services specifically for households experiencing domestic violence who are not living in refuges. The information concerns services for those who are in other forms of temporary accommodation, or who have remained in their homes, and people who have been re-housed. \n\nThis data shows that at the end September 2002, there were outreach services, floating support and resettlement provision for over 3,600 households in England specifically for people experiencing domestic violence. \n\nThere were, in addition, community or social alarm services for over 100 households. Other households who are experiencing domestic violence may be receiving support from a generic, rather than a specialist support service, such as family resettlement projects.\n\n Provision of support services to households not living in refuge accommodation, by region:\n\nTotal households experiencing domestic violence receiving support in non refuge accommodation\nFloating,  resettlement \n\nor outreach support\n\nEast Midlands\n274 (8%)\n\nEastern\n240 (7%)\n\nLondon\n846 (23%)\n\nNorth East\n215 (6%)\n\nNorth West\n870 (24%)\n\nSouth East\n399 (11%)\n\nSouth West\n337 (9%)\n\nWest Midlands\n306 (8%)\n\nYorkshire & the Humber\n155 (4%)\n\nEngland\n3,642 (100%)\n\nSource: End September 2002 Supporting People supply reporting\nThe Supporting People Handy Guide  sets out in greater detail the range of support needs which may be needed for women experiencing domestic violence and which services are likely to be eligible for funding under the Supporting People arrangements. \n\nSupport services for children may also form part of provision for survivors of domestic violence. In 1999, almost 80% of refuges employed specialist children's staff. The range of services includes organised play and outings, work with mothers, supporting children in education and counselling and therapy sessions.\n\nJyoti\n\nJyoti, an Asian Women's Refuge in Birmingham, employs two children's development workers, one of whom is funded by Health and Social Services. Supportive work with mothers as well as practical assistance in accessing education and health services for their children is a vital part of the workers role. This involves:\n\nDeveloping play programmes for children to increase their self-esteem and confidence. This involves outdoor excursions and indoor activities.\n\nBuilding a relationship with mothers and supporting them in caring for their children.\n\nSupporting children's educational development through organising re-admittance to school and aiding the mother during the process such as helping with completing forms and visiting the school.\n\nSupporting children and parents where child protection proceedings are taking place.\n\nMaking referrals to appropriate agencies that may aid the children's development can be made and accessed to support the family.\n\nChildren under five also receive the support of the local health visitor. Mothers have the opportunity to discuss their concerns surrounding the social and educational welfare of their child to the health visitor who would arrange additional support.\n\nA new approach to homelessness \n\nIn March this year, the new Homelessness Directorate published 'More than a roof' which marked a key change in the Government's approach to tackling homelessness. It signalled a recognition that, to tackle homelessness more effectively, the personal and social problems that cause and perpetuate homelessness need to be addressed as much as the need to address housing. \n\nLocal authorities across the country are responding to this new approach. They are using the opportunities provided by Supporting People and the new homelessness strategies to review their policies and service provision. A range of new initiatives and services specifically to try to deal more effectively with the homelessness implications of domestic violence are being established. Specialist resettlement workers for women from particular minority ethnic communities; outreach services supporting women before they reach crisis point and through the re-housing process; and specialist advisers assisting women on their legal and property rights. Some examples of new and existing projects across the country include:\n\nOutreach service in Eastbourne, Lewes and Wealden Councils\nThis is a joint venture with three councils in East Sussex working in partnership with Refuge.  A new outreach service is being developed to help support women who are considering leaving or have left their family home because of domestic violence. Violent relationship breakdown is one of the most significant causes of homelessness in these areas.\n\nRepeat homelessness in Manchester\nThe council has set up an outreach project for homeless households experiencing domestic violence, with particular focus on those who experience repeat homelessness. The aim is to engage with a client group who have complex problems including substance misuse and mental health needs in addition to their experiences of domestic violence. Outreach workers contacted those who have applied as homeless more than once over the last two years and have offered support and resettlement services for those in temporary accommodation or who have recently been rehoused. The service is also offered to all those who apply as homeless because of domestic violence.\n\nSafe house in Gateshead\n\nDomestic violence is one of the biggest causes of homelessness in Gateshead.  To better meet the range of needs of households experiencing domestic violence, the Council has developed two safe houses providing self-contained accommodation.  This will complement existing refuge provision in the area. The safe houses aim to provide accommodation for women for whom shared accommodation within the refuge is not appropriate for cultural reasons, or because of the make up of the household. Clients will be supported by tenancy support workers who will also co-ordinate specialist services. It is hoped this new accommodation will provide safety and security for around 40 households a year.\nSurviving Homelessness Project\n\nThis project in Nottingham provides a support service for homeless women and their children, particularly those who have been repeatedly homeless, as well as those at risk of homelessness. Through weekly drop in, therapeutic groupwork and intensive support to individuals, the project aims to break the cycle of homelessness, promote sustained resettlement and improve the health and well-being of women and children. Many of the families share a history of repeat homelessness, domestic violence, abuse as children and parenting difficulties. It provides a safe environment for mothers to explore their role as parents and promote the development of their children. It is a user led service, enabling users to have a real impact on service provision.\n\nCross Government activity on domestic violence\n\nThe Government is committed to tackling domestic violence, a serious and abhorrent crime. Stopping domestic violence and bringing perpetrators to justice is a priority. It aims to ensure that:\n\nWe increase safe choices for women and children, whether inside or outside the home.\n\nWe hold accountable all those responsible for perpetrating this crime.\n\nWe develop effective interventions to prevent repeat attacks.\n\nWe challenge the 'just a domestic' culture and ensure that this crime is no longer excused, tolerated or ignored.\n\nTo achieve this, the Government is concentrating on:\nIncreasing safe accommodation choices for women and children\n\nDeveloping early and effective healthcare intervention\n\nImproving the interface between the criminal and civil law\n\nEnsuring a consistent and appropriate response from the police and CPS\n\nPromoting education and awareness raising \n\nA Ministerial Group, chaired by John Denham, Minister of State in the Home Office, is working across Government to provide co-ordinated and concerted action on this issue at the highest level. Reducing and ultimately ending this crime requires active joined up working across all Government departments.   To this end, a virtual unit, led by the Home Office has been set up to deliver joined up action and policy on this issue through Whitehall.\n\nAction so far: \n\nThe Home Office has announced that a wide ranging consultation paper setting out proposals to prevent domestic violence will be published by spring 2003. It will build on the proposals included in the recent Criminal Justice White Paper, Justice for All. \n\nThe Women & Equality Unit in the DTI has commissioned a major review of the economic and social costs of domestic violence, the results will be published in summer 2003.\n\nThe Lord Chancellor's Department has announced an amendment to the Adoption and Children Bill which will make clear that harm includes any harm a child may suffer or is at risk of suffering as a result of witnessing the ill treatment of another person.\n\nThe Law Officers' Department has announced the publication of revised Crown Prosecution Service Guidelines.  This explains the relevant legislation and procedures to follow and sets out a useful checklist guide to assist users through the process.  A policy statement has also been developed which explains how the CPS deal with cases of domestic violence.  The guidance places clear responsibility on prosecutors to pursue a case without sole reliance on a victim's statement. seq level0 \\h \\r0   seq level1 \\h \\r0   seq level2 \\h \\r0   seq level3 \\h \\r0   seq level4 \\h \\r0   seq level5 \\h \\r0   seq level6 \\h \\r0   seq level7 \\h \\r0 \nDecember 2002\n\n  Stanko, E., Crisp, D., Hale, C., and Lucraft.

The\nintroduction of genetically modified herbicide tolerant (GMHT) sugar beet would result in a major\nsaving in weed control costs in the crop for growers, including control of problem weeds such as\nperennial weeds and weed beet.  However, there would be other economic consequences of growing\nGMHT beet, some of which would manifest themselves in other parts of the rotation, such as the\nprevious crop, the cereal stubbles that proceed most beet crops, soil tillage and spray application.  The\naverage national saving for UK sugar beet growers if they could use the technology would be in excess\n-1 -1 -1 -1 -1\nof £150 ha yr or £23 million yr , which includes reductions in agrochemical use of c.  £80 ha yr\n-1\nor £12 million yr .  However, for some growers, the gains would be much larger and for a few, less\nthan these figures.  The possible cost savings are sufficiently large that they could ensure that sugar\nbeet production, with its regionally important environmental benefits as a spring crop, remains\neconomically viable in the UK post reform of the EU sugar regime.\nKey words: Sugar beet, herbicide tolerance, economics\nIntroduction Calculation of Costs\nWorld sucrose production is around 133 million t For the purposes of this paper, it is assumed that\nper annum with the majority produced from cane GMHT sugar beet would be adopted by all farmers\nand 28% from sugar beet (Anon., 2000).

          "A review of local government procurement in England: consultation letterA review of local government procurement in England: \nconsultation letter \nDear Colleague, \nDelivering better services to citizens \nI am pleased to enclose a copy of Delivering Better Services for Citizens the report by the jointly \nsponsored DTLR and Local Government Association (LGA) taskforce chaired by Sir Ian Byatt to \nreview local government procurement. I also enclose the associated survey of local authority \nprocurement practice, Local Authority Procurement: A Research Report. \nThe key objective of the taskforce was to review the state of procurement skills and practice in \nlocal government in England in the light of the requirements of best value in particular. The report \nincludes 39 recommendations addressed to local government, central government, suppliers and \nother organisations with an interest in local government procurement. \nThe DTLR and LGA have agreed to hold a joint consultation process on the report before \nresponding themselves. A detailed response will follow in the Autumn with an action plan for \nimplementation. \nThe report is being sent out to all principal local authorities in England and to all the organisations \nwhich submitted evidence to the Taskforce (listed at Annex B of the report). We welcome views on \nany of the issues raised in the report. Responses from interested organisations or individuals other \nthan the above are of course also welcome. \nThe report is available on the this web site \nLocal Government Procurement Task Force \nLocal Authority Procurement: Research Summary \nFurther copies of the Report (ISBN 1 851124 85 3) and the Research Report (ISBN 1 85112 483 7) \ncan be bought from the DTLR Publication Sales Centre on 01709 891 318, priced £10 and £15 \nrespectively. \nFree summaries of the two documents Delivering Better Services for Citizens: Executive Summary \nand Recommendations 01LG0420 and Local Authority Procurement: Research Summary \n01LG0487 can be ordered from the DTLR Free Literature Centre on 0870 1226 236. \nAs we expect to receive a large number of responses we would prefer submissions to be via e-mail \nto the following address: \nbyatt.consultation@odpm.gsi.gov.uk \nIf you do not have access to the Internet please send your response to: Mark Upton \nLocal Government Competition and Quality Division \nDepartment for Transport, Local Government and the Regions \n5/B6 \nEland House \nBressenden Place \nLondon \nSW1E 5DU \nTel: 020 7944 4149 \nFax: 020 7944 4099 \nThe deadline for responses is Friday, 24 August 2001. It would assist our analysis of the responses \nif you could set out your comments under the relevant chapter headings used in the paper and \nclearly mark to which paragraphs or recommendations your comments refer. Furthermore, \nrespondents should explain who they are and, where relevant, whom they represent. \nThe Department or the LGA may wish to publish the responses in due course or deposit them in \ntheir own libraries or that of the Houses of Parliament. Should you wish your comments to be \ntreated in confidence please clearly indicate this in your response. Nevertheless, all responses will \nbe included in statistical summaries of comments received and views expressed. \nIf you have any questions or views on this consultation exercise you can contact Mark Upton at the \nabove address or by e-mail at: byatt.consultation@odpm.gsi.gov.uk \nYours sincerely, \n \nRICHARD FOOTITT MATTHEW WARBURTON \nDTLR LGA \n \n",

Since then it has grown to become a multi-role station and has become the base of the Sea Harrier Squadrons, Sea King Mk IV, and Lynx and Gazelle Commando Squadrons and since the closure of the Air Station at Portland in 1999 is the base for the two Lynx Helicopter Squadrons. It is also the home of Heron Flight, a communications unit of Jetstream aircraft, together with the Royal Navy Historic Flight which fly the Swordfish, Seahawk, Firefly and Sea Fury at air shows around the country during the summer.\n\n\n\nThe Station is one of the busiest military airfields in the United Kingdom and is amongst the largest in Europe, normally housing nine squadrons and up to one hundred and fifty aircraft of varying types. Yeovilton is the only airfield to operate helicopters, conventional fixed wing and vertical take off and landing aircraft simultaneously. It is also the biggest aviation establishment in the Royal Navy, employing over 3000 service personnel and civilians to operate and support squadrons, and to provide the many facilities required to run an Air Station.\n\n\n\nAs the parent station to a major part of the Fleet Air Arm’s front line strength, Yeovilton was heavily committed to the Falkland's Campaign in 1982 when 120 aircraft and 1400 of Yeovilton’s men served in the Task Force. During the Gulf crisis in 1991, the Air Station contributed over 500 men and women and 20 Sea Kings to the coalition forces. During this particular campaign, the Sea King helicopters supported the British 1st Armoured Division in the desert and the naval forces at sea. Shortly after returning from the Gulf, the Station’s helicopters were once again called upon, this time, to provide assistance for the Kurdish Relief Operation and the rescue work in the aftermath of the Bangladesh cyclone. For those humanitarian tasks some 400 men, together with 13 Royal Navy Sea Kings and 14 Royal Marine Gazelles and Lynx helicopters were deployed.\n\n\n\nMost recently, Sea Kings from Yeovilton have been a vital part of UN and NATO operations in the Former Republic of Yugoslavia and by the time they left in 2000 they were the longest serving Unit in the region. They were also involved in the operations in Sierra Leone. In addition, Sea Harriers embarked in aircraft carriers have been actively involved in NATO operations in Bosnia/Kosovo, as well as allied operations over Iraq, and flew many missions over Sierra Leone. RNAS Yeovilton personnel and their Squadrons have received many awards in these worldwide operations.\n\n\n\nThe Air Station is co-located with some staff of the Commodore Naval Aviation and the Equipment Support (Air), a Tri-Service Organisation which looks after all helicopter engineering and support matters. With such eminent neighbours, we welcome many distinguished visitors. This was typified in June 1991, when her Majesty the Queen presented new colours to the Naval Air Command during a ceremony at Yeovilton, and in 2001 the Prince of Wales officially opened the new Wardroom. In addition, the Fleet Air Arm Museum is situated on the doorstep and the history of Naval Aviation is carefully portrayed in many exhibits. The Museum also houses an extensive archive library and research department.\n\n\n\nSince Yeovilton was commissioned in 1940,a strong link with the town of Yeovil has been maintained. This was strengthened in June 1962 when the Ship’s Company was granted the Honorary Freedom of the Borough of Yeovil. There was a further association with the local community when, in June 1990, as a part of Yeovilton’s Golden Jubilee celebrations, Air Station personnel were invited by Ilchester Parish Council to become honorary parishioners and to march through the town with ‘flags flying, drums beating and bayonets fixed. HMS HERON has undergone a major re-building programme of Squadron buildings, Station facilities and accommodation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\tTop of page \n\n\t\t\tPrint \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t© Crown Copyright 2004.

But, of course, the summit was dominated by Iraq.\n\n\n\nI should like to place on record what I know will be the heartfelt gratitude of the entire House for the valour of British servicemen and women.  \n\n\n\nI send the deepest sympathy of the government and the whole House to the families of those who have died.  They gave their lives for our safety.  They had the courage to take the ultimate risk in the service of their country, and of those who value freedom everywhere in the world.  We owe them an immense debt.\n\n\n\nI would also like to extend my condolences and those of our nation to the families of the American personnel who have sadly been lost in recent days.\n\n\n\nCENTRAL OBJECTIVES\n\n\n\nWe are now just four days into this conflict.  It is worth restating our central objectives.  They are to remove Saddam Hussein from power and ensure Iraq is disarmed of all chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programmes.  But in achieving these objectives, we have also embraced other considerations.  We want to do this campaign in a way that minimises the suffering of ordinary Iraqi people, brutalised by Saddam; to safeguard the wealth of the country for the future prosperity of the people; and to make this a war not of conquest but of liberation.\n\n\n\nFor this reason, we did not, as some expected, mount a heavy bombing campaign first, followed by a land campaign.  Instead, land forces were immediately in action, securing oil installations, gaining strategic assets and retaining them, not destroying them.  The air campaign has been precisely targeted.  Of course there will have been civilian casualties.  But we have done all we humanly can, to keep them to a minimum.  Water and electricity supplies are being spared.  The targets are the infrastructure, command and control of Saddam's regime not of the civilian population.  And we are making massive efforts to clear lines of supply for humanitarian aid, though the presence of mines is hindering us.\n\n\n\nBy contrast, the nature of Saddam's regime is all too plainly expressed in its actions.  The oil wealth was mined and deep-mined at that.  Had we not struck quickly, Iraq's future wealth would even now be burning away.  Prisoners are being paraded in defiance of all  international conventions.  Those who dare speak criticism of the regime are being executed.\n\n\n\nTHE MILITARY CAMPAIGN\n\n\n\nLet me now give the House some detail of the military campaign.  \n\n\n\nIn the south, our aim was to secure the key oil installations on the al-Faw Peninsula; to take the port of Umm Qasr, the only Iraqi port to the outside world; and to render Basra, the second largest city in Iraq, ineffective as a base for military operations by Saddam against coalition troops.  In the West, in the desert, our aim is to prevent Saddam from using it as a base for hostile external aggression.  In the North, our objective is to protect people in the Kurdish autonomous zone, to secure the Northern oil fields and to ensure the North cannot provide a base for Saddam’s resistance. \n\n\n\nThen, the vital goal is to reach Baghdad as swiftly as possible, thus bringing the end of the regime closer.  \n\n\n\nThere is a limit to how much I can say, about the detail of our operations, especially those involving Special Forces, as I’m sure the House understands.  But, with that caveat, at present, the British and US troops have taken the al-Faw peninsula.  That is now secure.  The southern oil installations are under coalition control.  The port of Umm Qasr despite continuing pockets of resistance is under allied control but the waterway essential for humanitarian aid may be blocked by mines and will take some days to sweep.  Basrah is surrounded and cannot be used as an Iraqi base. But in Basrah there are pockets of Saddam’s most fiercely loyal security services who are holding out.  They are contained but still able to inflict casualties on our troops and so we are proceeding with caution.  Basrah international airport has been made secure.  The Western desert is largely secure.  In the North, there have been air attacks on regime targets in Mosul, Kirkuk and Tikrit.  We have been in constant contact with the Turkish Government and the Kurdish Authorities to urge calm.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, coalition forces led by the American 5th Corps are on the way to Baghdad.  As we speak, they are about 60 miles south of Baghdad near Karbala.   It is a little way from there that they will encounter the Medina Division of the Republican Guard who are defending the route to Baghdad.  This will be a crucial moment.\n\n\n\nCoalition forces are also advancing on Al Kut, in the East of Iraq.  The two main bridges over the Euphrates south of Baghdad have been taken intact.  This is of critical significance.\n\n\n\nThe air campaign has attacked Iraqi military installations, the centres of Saddam’s regime and command and control centres.  A total of over 5000 sorties has taken place.\n\n\n\nThousands of Iraqi soldiers have surrendered.  Still more have simply left the field, their units disintegrating.  But there are those, closest to Saddam that are resisting and will resist strongly.  They are the elite that are hated by the local population and have little to lose.  There are bound, therefore, to be difficult days ahead, but the strategy and its timing are proceeding according to plan. \n\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COUNCIL\n\n\n\nAt the European Council, there were of course deep divisions over the coalition action.  That is well known.  But it is not that all of European opinion is one way.  On the contrary, there was both understanding and support for the British position from many nations represented at the Council and near unanimous endorsement from the 10 accession countries who joined our Council on Friday afternoon.  In any event, whatever disagreements about the conflict itself, Europe came together to set out clearly its wishes and responsibilities in post-conflict Iraq.\n\n\n\nThe Council agreed the need to be active in the humanitarian field and to ensure that the oil revenues are held for the Iraqi people by the UN and that the Oil for Food programme continues.\n\n\n\nThe Council further agreed that the UN Security Council should give the UN a strong mandate for post-conflict Iraq and make sure that the new administration is one that is representative, careful of the human rights of the Iraqi people and allows the people to live at peace inside Iraq and with its neighbours.\n\n\n\nTHE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Council stressed the vital importance of the Middle East Peace Process and the publication of the Roadmap drawn up by the US, EU, Russia and the UN and now endorsed by us all.  I reported on the talks we had had both with the US Administration and the Palestinian Authority.  I welcomed the appointment of Mahmoud Abbas as Palestinian Prime Minister.  I also welcomed the US intention to publish the Roadmap for peace as soon as the Prime Minister and his government are in place.\n\n\n\nI know it seems out of place but I should say one word on the conventional subject matter of the summit.  Though overshadowed by Iraq, this summit on economic reform regained some momentum.  In the last few months, energy liberalisation, a single Europe-wide Patent and a single Europe Sky policy have all been agreed.  An Employment Taskforce due to report on ways to cut unemployment without generating new regulation was agreed.  This marks progress, though much remains to be done.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nTo return to the conflict, there are, of course, difficulties that have arisen, tragedies and accidents.  We grieve for the lives lost.  That is in the nature of war.  And it is in the nature of today’s instant, live reporting of war, that people see the pain and blood in vivid and shocking terms.  But it is worth recalling the nature of what is not always apparent, what we do not see: a nation, degraded and brutalised by decades of barbarous rule, a country that is potentially rich but whose people go hungry and whose children die needlessly from malnutrition and disease; and a regime to whom repression, torture, the abuse of human rights and possession of WMD define their very nature.\n\n\n\nThat is why we must achieve our objectives.  Saddam will go, this regime will be replaced.  The Iraqi people will be helped to a better future.  The weapons of mass destruction – for which a peaceful Iraq has no use – will be eliminated.  That we will encounter more difficulties and anxious moments in the days ahead is certain.  But no less certain, indeed more so, is coalition victory.\n\n\n\n الترجمة العربية\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to current News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t \t\n\n2004\n\n\n\n\t \t\n\t\n\nJAN\n\n\t\n\nFEB\n\n\t\n\nMAR\n\n\n\t\n\nAPR\n\n\t\n\nMAY\n\n\t\n\nJUN\n\n\n\t\n\nJUL\n\n\t\n\nAUG\n\n\t\n\nSEP\n\n\n\t\n\nOCT\n\n\t\n\nNOV\n\n\t\n\nDEC\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\n\t \t\n\n2003\n\n\n\n\t \t\n\t\n\nJAN\n\n\t\n\nFEB\n\n\t\n\nMAR\n\n\n\t\n\nAPR\n\n\t\n\nMAY\n\n\t\n\nJUN\n\n\n\t\n\nJUL\n\n\t\n\nAUG\n\n\t\n\nSEP\n\n\n\t\n\nOCT\n\n\t\n\nNOV\n\n\t\n\nDEC\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The aim of our strategy focuses on the three key themes of our Latin America strategy: social inclusion, pro-poor growth and pro-poor governance.  DFID in Bolivia has moved from funding sector projects to one of higher-level policy engagement linked to resource transfers to the public sector, combined with strategic support to civil society action at the national level. In that context, the goal of DFID’s future strategy is that state and society work together to achieve sustainable poverty reduction in Bolivia.  The purpose is to support the implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy.  The sustainability element of the goal statement will require a commitment from international cooperation and the Government of Bolivia to work for a reduction in the current high levels of aid dependency.

          "Response to the National Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy -…Response to the National Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy\n1. The principles that should underpin the strategy\nThe Government should be involved in managing the harmful effects of alcohol\nmisuse for the following reasons:\n§ The harmful effects of alcohol misuse need to be publicised through\npublic/national campaigns and it is the Government who are best equipped to\nmanage and co-ordinate such campaigns. An example of this are Drink Drive\ncampaigns.\n§ Education aimed at raising awareness is most effective when managed or co-\nordinated at a national level. National media/public information adverts ensure\neverybody gets the same message, which can positively affect behaviour.  The\nDepartment of Health already have excellent information and has run campaigns\non the effects of Drug abuse. A similar approach would assist an Alcohol Harm\nReduction Strategy.\n§ Alcohol misuse causes much crime and disorder\nWhen Government intervention is justified\n§ Government intervention is justified when the health or well being of individuals\nor the general public begin to suffer.  For example, Drink Drive campaigns and\nthe legislation that accompanies this are a response to the devastating effects that\ndrink driving has had on thousands of people. Alcohol and drug misuse are a huge\ncost to society economically and socially, and it is only through Government\nintervention that this can be tackled effectively and in a consistent manner.\n5. What principles should underpin a national alcohol harm reduction strategy?\n§ The basic principle has got to be education, focusing on the health implications of\nalcohol misuse.\n§ It is also important to focus on how anti-social behaviour is linked to alcohol\nmisuse and the ramifications of such behaviour.\n§ The principle of the primacy of crime and disorder reduction\n21. How, in your experience, can we minimise and prevent the injuries that are\npresented to A&E departments as a result of alcohol related assaults (often with\nglasses and bottles) or home and workplace alcohol-related accidents?\n§ Effective door keeping at licensed premises would go some way to reduce the\nnumber of alcohol related assaults. Training to a national standard for door\nsupervisors would be part of the overall solution.§ Liasing with managers of problem premises and agreeing on good practice, such\nas toughened or plastic glasses and setting a maximum number for the premises,\nwould also be part of the solution.\n§ Encourage night-clubs to provide transport for customers to rail links etc, to move\ndrinkers away from town centres.\n§ Local authorities to make provision for larger Taxi Rank parking in the late\nevenings near town centre Public Houses, for ease of transport and to stop people\ncongregating.\n23. What evidence is there about the links between alcohol and crime and the links\nbetween alcohol and anti-social behaviour? Are there any pieces of evidence you\nthink we should be aware of? Where are there gaps in the evidence?\n§ There is research, on the Home Office Crime Reduction toolkit website, which\nillustrate the links between alcohol and crime, and alcohol and anti social\nbehaviour. In cases of Domestic Violence practitioners within Hertfordshire\nConstabulary suspect that alcohol could be a contributing factor in 50% of\nincidents. In a large percentage of these incidents, the alcohol is consumed in the\nhome environment. Again, education and awareness raising could have an\ninfluence in this area.\nwww.alcoholism.about.com gives good information on the link between alcohol and\ncrime/anti social behaviour.\n24. In your experience, is alcohol a factor in habitual re-offending? Does it lead to\nparticular types of crime? How far does it lead to one-off offences?\n§ Alcohol does appear to be a factor in habitual re-offending.\n§ Alcohol appears to be a major factor in offences of violence and criminal damage.\n§ One-off opportunistic offences can and do occur as a result of excessive alcohol\nconsumption.\n25. To what extent can alcohol convincingly be demonstrated to be a factor in\ncriminal and disorderly behaviour? How much is perception and how much is\nreality? What fuels the perceptions and are they accurate?\n§ Figures identified by the Portman Group www.portman-group.org.uk suggest that the\nperception is higher than reality in relation to alcohol related crime.\n§ Perceptions can be fuelled by local press reporting incidents of anti social behaviour,\nor through general rowdy behaviour in busy town centres in the late evening, and\nincreased noise levels. 25. Alcohol is far from being the only factor in crime and\ndisorder. Other factors are involved-for example town centre disorder can be\ninfluenced by lack of availability of transport or design of environment. What other\nfactors might be involved? How easy are these to influence? Who is responsible for\nthem?\n26. Alcohol is far from being the only factor in crime and disorder. Other factors are\ninvolved – for example town centre disorder can be influenced by lack of availability\nof transport or design of environment. What other factors might be involved? How\neasy are these to influence? Who is responsible for them?§ There are other factors involved in crime and disorder such as:\n  late night take-a-way restaurants which can attract groups of youths etc.\n  a lack of appropriate activity for young people in an area\n  Environmental and building design i.e. uncontrolled stairwells to flats can be a\nplace for groups to ‘hang out’.\n§ As long as there are resources available, these factors can be influenced relatively\neasily. Strict licensing also plays a significant part in reducing problems in this\narea.  Longer licensing hours may actually assist as people consume alcohol at\ndifferent times.\n§ Responsibility falls on many people here, for example members of  Crime and\nDisorder Reduction Partnerships, shopkeepers and residents.\n27. How does the impact of alcohol on urban environments differ from its impact\non rural environments? What are the differences between urban and rural\ndrinking patterns and how do they affect those communities and surroundings?\n§ There is a difference between the impact of alcohol on urban and rural\nenvironments. For example, when licensing laws were more restrictive,\npeople who drank in rural areas felt safer drinking in licensed premises\noutside of licensing hours. The reason for this was rural areas had less\npolicing and there was the belief there was less chance of being caught.\n§ Usually, in urban areas there is a wide choice of drinking establishments such\nas Public Houses, restaurants and bars, where people can move around to\nconsume alcohol, often causing disorder in the process. However, in rural\nareas local inhabitants will have little choice other than the Public House and\nwill stay in their local area.\n§ There are differences between rural and urban drinking patterns:\n  In urban areas there is more opportunity to drink through the day,\nwhereas in rural areas in all probability, there would not be the\ndemand for longer opening hours.\n  Because there are more establishments in urban areas, there is more\nopportunity to move around, whereas in rural areas people are\nconfined to their ‘local’.\n  Statistics show that Police tend to receive fewer complaints about\ncountry public houses.\n  In urban areas people often move from pub to pub. This can encourage\ntown centre disorder, whereas in rural areas people tend to stay in the\nsame place in the vicinity of their home.\n  In some small towns in Hertfordshire there is evidence of anti-social\nbehaviour being linked to under aged drinking.  It would appear that\nthe alcohol is being obtained in most cases from local off licenses.\n  Hertfordshire have entered into a joint protocol with Trading\nStandards to use “test purchases” to target premises in problem\nareas.  A partnership approach is used and these problems are\naddressed through the Local Authority Crime and Disorder\nReduction Partnerships. Anti social behaviour contracts and in\nserious circumstances ASBO’s can be applied for.\n  There is also evidence in the Youth Lifestyles Survey (“63% of 16\nand 17 year olds whom had drunk in the last year said that theyusually bought alcohol for themselves).  The Licensing (Young\nPersons) Bill currently going through Parliament should impact\non these problems.\n28. To what extent can impacts on the environment (including crime, disorder, noise\nand waste) be designed out, for example by use of plastic drinking glasses? Are there\nexamples of good practice it would be helpful for us to be aware of?\n§ Firstly, looking at established towns options could include:\n  Closing down premises that are badly run.\n  Enforcing legislation on the use of Identification to enter clubs and pubs etc.\n§ Planning is easier in new towns.  Restaurants and other late night establishments\ncan be built in one area and situated near good communication links and away\nfrom residential housing. Stevenage Leisure Park is a good example of this.  Other\nLocal authorities could be encouraged to look at ‘brown field’ sites that could be\ndeveloped in a similar way.\n29. There are some examples of good practice where a range of organisations\nresponsible for dealing with different aspects of alcohol have successfully ‘combined\nefforts’ and shared information to tackle alcohol-related crime and disorder together.\nShould this approach be encouraged more widely? What inhibits organisations or\ncommunities from taking such an approach?\n§ It is essential that organisations combine efforts and share information; they all\nhave different expertise which can help to tackle the problem of alcohol-related\ncrime from different angles.\n§ Concerns about the legality of information sharing often inhibits organisations and\ncommunities from working together. Protocols for the exchange of information\nneed to be in place. Education Departments receive will have information on\npupils who consume alcohol regularly, but the issue remains “who owns the\nresponse to the problem?”\n§ Youth drinking issues need to be addressed in a partnership approach between\nPolice, Local Authorities, and Education working together. When communities\nexperience the benefits of partnership working, solutions will have more\ncredibility and will be better co-ordinated through a holistic and joined up\napproach. We need to get rid of the lack of trust and suspicion between agencies\nand the community which sometimes exists, by sharing information and working\ntogether towards a common goal.\n30. Is it right that anti-crime and anti-social behaviour initiatives need to be targeted\non young people?\n§ Not necessarily.  Initiatives aimed at tackling anti-social behaviour have to target\na whole range of people. To simply target just one group is not addressing theproblem of anti-social behaviour. Nationally, ASBO’s have been enforced on\nmore adults than young people. It is not just young people who commit anti-social\nbehaviour.\n31. Should we be encouraging different drinking patterns-in terms of time spent\ndrinking, location of drinking etc, in order to tackle alcohol-related crime and\ndisorder?\nAlready covered above. However, it would be essential to assess and evaluate longer\ndrinking hours after an appropriate period.\n32. How can the law on, and policing approaches to public drunkenness and street\ndrinking help to tackle these problems? Are existing controls and powers (such as\nthose for local authorities to introduce drinking zones) effective. Are they sufficient?\n§ The following could help to tackle the problem of public drunkenness and street\ndrinking:\n  The law needs to be clear and consistent and, most importantly, location\nspecific.\n  Policing approaches need to be specific, consistent and again location\nspecific.\n§ Existing controls and powers have a limited effect. Drinking zones have proved\nvery difficult to “police”, one example is in St Albans town centre in\nHertfordshire. Although the Local Authority applied and was granted the bylaw\nthey have been reluctant to prosecute offenders identified by the Police.  Local\nofficers now seize the alcohol without attempting a prosecution.  Other Local\nAuthorities have resisted applying for the bylaw because of the cost of following\nthrough a prosecution.\n§ The laws on drunkenness are adequate. However, officers still have a problem\nwhen they stop a person under 18yrs in possession of alcohol.  If the container is\nunopened and there is no evidence of purchase officers do not have power to\nconfiscate. In some areas the alcohol is purchased by 18 year olds for siblings.\nRecent new laws may impact on this.\n34. Drink –drive policies are generally acknowledged to have been successful. What\ncan we learn from them?\n§ Policies have been instrumental in making drink driving socially unacceptable and\nhave changed the culture of driving and drinking. This proves that awareness\ncampaigns do work, but only over a long period. There is no quick fix!\n§ However, the numbers who drive under the influence of alcohol are still high.\nYoung people are now as likely to drive under the influence of drugs and drug -\ndriving testing needs to be developed to impact on this area.\n§ We have to learn from past drink-drive campaigns and promote initiatives such as\nfree non-alcoholic drinks for designated drivers. Busy village licensed premisescould be targeted to provide these.  Roadside notices in “hot spots” such as\n“Police breath tested 20 people here last Christmas” could also help.\n35. Domestic violence is often associated with alcohol misuse – either by the\nperpetrator, or, on occasion, by the victim. What in your experience, is the nature of\nthis link and what would you see as good practice in tackling the interrelationship\nbetween violence and alcohol misuse?\n§ The nature of the link between domestic violence and alcohol misuse is that\nalcohol could be the catalyst to the violence. As already identified, it is believed\nthat alcohol is a factor in approximately 50% of domestic violence related\nincidents.\n§ The nature of the link is that alcohol changes behaviour.  Education and awareness\ncould assist here, as can effective support from domestic violence personnel. The\nvictim has got to be encouraged to speak up and obtain the necessary help; the\nsame can also be said of the perpetrator!\n§ However in low income groups home consumption leading to domestic violence\nappears to be a major problem. Highlighting this contributing factor through\ndomestic violence campaigns could assist in reducing the instances of alcohol\nrelated violence.\n",

The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) is conducting a Financial Management and Policy Review (FMPR) of the Groundwork organisation and of DETR's sponsorship of it. This paper sets out the background, discusses issues identified during the Review so far, and invites comments. Comments should be sent to the address at the end of the paper by 28 July 2000. The Department will make all responses publicly available unless respondents ask for their comments to be treated in confidence.\n\nThe purposes of an FMPR\n\n2. It is Government policy that Departments should conduct FMPRs of the non-Departmental Public Bodies (NDPBs) they sponsor every five years or so, as a major component of a programme of continuous improvement. The purposes are to:\n\nassess whether there is a continuing need for the functions or services provided by the NDPB, and whether these should continue to be provided by a public body (known as the \"Prior Options\" part of the FMPR); and\n\ncarry out a forward looking review of the operation and management of the NDPB and the sponsorship of it by its parent Department, to establish the best organisational options for delivering the functions and services and developing and improving performance in the future.\n\n3. The Groundwork organisation is a federation of independent charitable bodies. It is not created by statute, nor do Ministers appoint its Board members. So it is not an NDPB or any other type of public body. Nevertheless, DETR and Groundwork have agreed that it is timely to conduct a review using the FMPR framework.\n\n4. The \"Prior Options\" part of the FMPR has been largely completed following a study for DETR by Baker Associates (see paragraphs 13-15). This paper focuses mainly on the issues to be considered in the second part of the FMPR process.\n\nGroundwork's mission\n\n5. Groundwork was established in 1981. Its mission is to bring about sustainable improvements to the local environment, through partnerships, and to contribute to economic and social regeneration. This is supported by objectives on:\n\nphysical environmental improvements;\n\neducation and community involvement;\n\nintegration of the economy and the environment;\n\npartnership development and promotion, and\n\nfundraising and management of the organisation.\n\n6. These objectives are delivered through 37 national and regional programmes, and in turn through local schemes which Groundwork estimates involve 60,000 adults and over 120,000 schoolchildren in sustainable development projects each year. Groundwork is the largest provider of placements on the Environment Task Force option of the Government's New Deal for Young People.\n\n7. Further details of Groundwork's objectives and programmes can be found at Annex A and on the Groundwork web site.\n\nThe Groundwork organisation\n\n8. The organisation currently consists of Groundwork UK which has offices in Birmingham, London and Manchester, and 43 Groundwork Trusts operating primarily in areas of social need and environmental degradation in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. But there are many such areas where there is no Groundwork Trust and some existing Trusts operate in areas which, while they may include pockets of need or degradation, do not rank highly overall on these criteria.\n\n9. Each Trust is constituted as an independent charity and a company limited by guarantee and is managed by a Board of trustees. Groundwork UK is similarly constituted and managed, with the Trusts as company members. Groundwork UK and some of the Trusts have trading subsidiaries whose profits are covenanted to their parent charity.\n\n10. In November 1999 the Groundwork organisation implemented a change in its structure to make Groundwork UK more responsive and accountable to the individual Trusts, and to empower them to elect the members of the Federation Board. At the same time the national body, known previously as the Groundwork Foundation, was renamed the Groundwork Federation. This serves to emphasise its role in delivering effective support to the Trusts in planning and implementing their programmes and in ensuring that good practice is identified and shared.\n\nCurrent funding\n\n11. Groundwork receives funds from many organisations. In 1998/99 their total income was £53.2 million, made up as follows:\n\nDETR funding of the Groundwork Federation\n£6.7m\n13%\n\nOther public bodies: Agencies and NDPB\n£3.1m\n6%\n\nRegional Development Agencies (SRB funds)\n£9.1m\n17%\n\nLocal authorities\n£8.6m\n16%\n\nEuropean Union\n£6.6m\n12%\n\nNational Lottery\n£5.1m\n10%\n\nPrivate sector including landfill tax\n£13.6m\n25%\n\nOther\n£0.4m\n1%\n\nTOTAL\n£53.2m\n100%\n\n12. This was almost £10m (24%) higher than in 1997/98. Groundwork is budgeting for more modest growth of £8m (11%) in 1999/2000. It is DETR's funding of the Federation that is the primary focus of this review. This funding supports many of the Federation's activities and enables it to give grants to individual Trusts to support theirs. DETR's funds also enable the Federation and Trusts to lever in funds from many of the sources listed above.\n\nThe status of Groundwork\n\n13. Groundwork is a legally independent body from Government. However, it receives substantial public funding and, as a condition of such funding, it is subjected to some though not all of the controls that would be applied to an NDPB. Consequently, Groundwork's business is transacted through an annual Corporate Plan which is presented for discussion with DETR officials and the sponsor Minister. Within the framework of that Plan and a Financial Memorandum issued by DETR, Groundwork has considerable discretion over how it spends the funds granted by DETR; and DETR's Permanent Secretary has designated Groundwork's Chief Executive as an Accounting Officer. These well-tested arrangements provide proper accountability for the significant sums of public money granted to Groundwork.\n\n14. Overall, this makes Groundwork one of DETR's \"preferred partners\" in the sense that the Department bids for funds specifically for Groundwork, rather than for \"environmental regeneration\", in successive spending reviews. Once an allocation has been agreed, it is rarely changed and Groundwork can be confident of receiving it subject only to broad justification in its Corporate Plans and continued progress in delivering the planned outputs. This is an unusual and privileged position for a charitable body.\n\n15. The contrasting position is that of an organisation having a contractual relationship with DETR. This will be finite in time, the contract will have been awarded by competition and will specify in detail the work to be done, and the contractor will have to compete again on merit with others in the same business for future work. DETR does not wish to suggest that Groundwork should become an NDPB, nor that it should move to a purely contractual relationship with Groundwork. Apart from other objections, the former may extinguish Groundwork's valued status in the charitable sector, while the latter may risk inhibiting the innovation and flexibility that are amongst Groundwork's major strengths. However, DETR wishes to bring about a greater degree of competition in the way in which public funds are allocated to the Groundwork UK and trusts, and greater clarity in what such funds are \"purchasing\" on behalf of the taxpayer.\n\nThe Prior Options Stage of the FMPR\n\n16. To inform the first part of the FMPR and to provide some evidence for the second stage, DETR commissioned Baker Associates to review:\n\nthe extent to which Groundwork delivers outputs that contribute to the achievement of the Government's regeneration objectives; and\n\nthe most effective mechanisms for delivering these outputs.\n\n17. Baker Associates presented their Report in July 1999. It provides a detailed analysis of the many strengths that underpin Groundwork's approach and achievements, and identifies areas where its effectiveness could be improved. A copy of the Report's Executive Summary is at Annex B.\n\n18. The Report's key conclusions in respect of the Government's regeneration objectives are that:\n\nin practice as well as in aspiration, Groundwork is addressing most of the Government's regeneration priorities;\n\nGroundwork has a particular ability to reach groups, including local businesses and the socially excluded, who are often not reached by other regeneration schemes; has a flexible and innovative approach to its work and can respond well to its partners' priorities; and is achieving multiple outputs on projects and programmes, working across institutional and cultural divides, and \"delivering things that might not otherwise get done\";\n\nthere is some evidence that Groundwork's schemes are of lasting benefit but that, in areas of high social deprivation and economic disadvantage, these may not be retained without continuing investment;\n\nsupporting Groundwork with non-project specific funding, as well as with project funding, is a very cost effective way of ensuring that effective regeneration is delivered in areas that need it most, and that new and effective approaches to regeneration are developed; and\n\nmuch more benefit could be gained if Groundwork's innovations were better evaluated and a more systematic approach taken to spreading best practice.\n\n19. Having regard to the findings of Baker Associates, DETR considers that Groundwork should remain amongst the key agencies delivering the Government's regeneration objectives. However, DETR also acknowledges a wide diversity of such agencies, each contributing their own particular strengths to the regeneration process. Urban greening and sustainable development, to which Groundwork brought a unique perspective and expertise in the early 1980s, are now necessary ingredients of mainstream Government programmes. It is therefore the DETR's role to promote the incorporation of relevant policies in all programmes and to ensure that the expertise needed to formulate and apply such policies is widely available to public, private and voluntary bodies.\n\n20. The Government is also committed to supporting local delivery of sustainable development through policies for social inclusion and urban renaissance, and acknowledges that there are a number of organisations whose objectives and outputs include ones that are delivered by Groundwork. For example, the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers, Development Trusts, partnerships implementing schemes under the Single Regeneration Budget and the New Deal for Communities, Wildlife Trusts, the Regional Development Agencies and the Coalfields Regeneration Trust.\n\n21. Against that background, the purpose of this second part of the FMPR is consider the scope for even greater transparency and accountability, effectiveness and best value in DETR's sponsorship of the Groundwork organisation. The central issues are:\n\nthe appropriate mechanisms for determining and delivering future DETR support for the Groundwork Federation and Trusts, and the extent to which this should be in competition with other agencies;\n\nthe scope for improving the monitoring of performance and outputs, and the evaluation and sharing of good practice within the organisation and more widely; and\n\nDETR's role in the creation of new Trusts.\n\nStrategic and project funding\n\n22. A central issue is the distinction between the strategic or core costs of an organisation such as Groundwork and the funding needed to support specific projects. This was recognised in the Compact on Relations between Government and the Voluntary and Community Sector in England, published in November 1998. The Compact acknowledges that, in a competitive funding environment, many voluntary and community organisations can find it difficult to secure funding to support the core management and administration functions they need to operate efficiently and effectively. Government funding towards these core costs can help both Departments and the voluntary organisations achieve their strategic aims, providing the organisations with a base from which to develop and promote their objectives, lever in other funds, and ensure that these are used to best effect.\n\n23. For bodies such as Groundwork, with a central Federation supported by and supporting a network of local Trusts, this distinction is mirrored in its own organisational structure. While each Trust necessarily incurs some management and administrative costs, the Federation provides a wide range of central services that the Trusts rely on to function effectively. These services include policy and programme development, advice on governance and financial management, fundraising, assessment of performance, and the identification and sharing of good practice. The Trusts in turn inform the work of the Federation, enhancing its effectiveness.\n\nFuture DETR support for Groundwork\n\n24. With these considerations in mind, DETR invites comments on two options for its future funding of Groundwork:\n\na refinement of the current position, under which DETR continues to give direct support to the Federation and, through it, to individual Trusts; and\n\na \"regional\" option, under which individual Trusts would be eligible to compete for public funds regionally through the Regional Development Agencies or the Government Offices for the Regions. Under this option Groundwork UK would either be funded directly from DETR, or by introducing a subscription for individual trusts.\n\n(i) Refinement of the current position\n\n25. With this option, DETR would continue to provide funds specifically for the Federation, for its own use and to provide grants for which individual Trusts would compete. The main benefit of this option is that it would retain a well-tested sponsorship model and delivery mechanism for environmental regeneration which has proved to be effective. However, in adopting this option, there would be a need to consider ways in which its effectiveness could be improved to offer best value in the use of public funds for regeneration purposes.\n\n(ii) The regional option\n\n26. Under this option, DETR would invite the Regional Development Agencies set up in England outside London in 1999 and the Greater London Authority, or the Government Offices for the Regions to operate a grant scheme for environmental regeneration. DETR would transfer funds, at current levels, to the RDAs and GLA, or GO-Rs for this purpose. DETR would need to consider the extent to which suitable funding mechanisms could be established, the basis upon which allocations would be made to each region and accessed by individual trusts. The Department would also need to consider an appropriate transitional arrangement where such funds would be reserved or ring-fenced for use by existing Groundwork Trusts. Different arrangements would be needed to support the Trusts in Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\n27. The Groundwork Federation would continue to be eligible for funds directly from DETR, subject to improved procedures and clarity as indicated above. Alternatively, the Federation might consider covering some or all of its costs by introducing a subscription for individual Trusts to belong to the Groundwork organisation. Such an arrangement would mirror Groundwork's organisational changes (see paragraph 10) by giving the Trusts the funding responsibilities to complement their greater control over the Federation. However, DETR recognises that introducing a subscription might be tantamount to increasing Trusts' own core costs and so open to the issues discussed at paragraphs 22 and 23 above. It might also cause some Trusts to review their membership of the organisation, so threatening its cohesion. Nevertheless, DETR would welcome comments on this option.\n\nFunding the Federation\n\n28. Under both options (i) and (ii), DETR would, however, wish to review the mechanism by and terms on which it awards public funds to the Federation, and how the Federation in turn passes such funds, and benefits that accrue from such funds to individual Trusts. The aim would be to achieve even greater openness and clarity of purpose and to avoid Trusts becoming overly dependent on public funds, thereby limiting the funds available for new Trusts or initiatives, and best value in the use of public funds. This is discussed further in relation to individual Trusts below.\n\nFunding the Trusts\n\n29. Under option (i), the Groundwork Trusts would continue to receive DETR funds through the Federation. Under option (ii) they would receive them, and later compete for them, from the RDAs or the GO-Rs.\n\n30. From DETR: It would be for DETR to specify the terms on which the Trusts received public funds. This raises the issue of the \"12 year rule\", which the then Department of the Environment introduced in 1997 to reflect the view that regeneration initiatives should either meet their objectives within a set period or, in the longer term, become self-sustaining. The \"rule\" states that DETR funding to individual trusts for programme and development will normally only be available for a period of up to 12 years. This is intended to discourage Trusts from expecting public funds indefinitely, and ensures that some funds remain uncommitted and available to support new initiatives.\n\n31. The \"rule\" is due to bite for the first time later in 2000, when some Trusts will have received DoE/DETR funds for 12 years. At the same time further experience of regeneration projects suggests, as Baker Associates' Report has found, that continuing investment may be needed to ensure that a scheme's benefits are retained in the longer term. Particularly where that continuing investment is for activities such as monitoring and evaluation, and learning lessons to apply to future schemes, Trusts may find it difficult to attract the necessary resources from potential funders keen to see tangible social and environmental improvements.\n\n32. The provisions of \"the rule\" are flexible and enable the Department to consider cases for funding individual trusts beyond the 12-year period, in exceptional circumstances. DETR therefore accepts that, in some cases, longer term core funding of Groundwork Trusts from public funds may be justified, to ensure that full and continuing value is obtained from previous investment. Nevertheless, the Department maintains the view that Trusts should still aim for self-sufficiency from other sources in the longer term and should not expect public funding in perpetuity.\n\n33. However, if the outcome of the FMPR is that DETR funds continue to reach individual Trusts through the Federation, DETR will consider whether there is a case for replacing the \"12 year rule\". A possible option could be a sliding scale for the maximum percentage support that its funds can give to a project or core activity at any given time. The precise approach and figures would need further thought, and would need to include some flexibility to cope with unusual or changing circumstances. But, the key principle is that the input of DETR funds should taper to a low level - possibly to zero in some cases, over a period of no more than 10 years.\n\n34. From the RDAs or GO-Rs: If the outcome of the FMPR is option (ii) - that DETR funds reach individual Trusts via RDAs or GO-Rs, it would be for the RDAs or the GO-Rs to determine the appropriate grant conditions taking into account DETR and other guidance. This could lead to a diversity of priorities and practice between regions. It could also spur the regional partners, including the Groundwork Trusts, into preparing or enhancing their own regional strategies to support their bids for funds.\n\nImproving monitoring, performance outputs evaluation and good practice.\n\n35. The Baker report identified two areas where Groundwork's performance could be improved:\n\nmonitoring effectiveness and evaluating performance of projects; and \n\ndisseminating good practice within and without the organisation.\n\n36. The Government's approach to regeneration emphasises the need to develop effective partnership, which involve local communities. This recognises that the long term success and benefits of regeneration are more likely to occur when people work together in partnership. It also recognises the need to build-up the capacity of local communities and voluntary sectors so that they are able to become more involved in regeneration processes. A key to achieving these aims is the ability for all those involved in regeneration processes to learn from experience and to share good practice.\n\n37. Therefore, the Department wishes to consider ways in which the performance of Groundwork could be improved by avoiding 'reinventing the wheel', and by building on successful practice. This suggests a need for better and more structured approaches to evaluating Groundwork projects. We also need to identify the approaches that have worked well and good and bad practice, and provide a better basis for disseminating transferable lessons.\n\n38. It is necessary to develop more effective means of promoting and disseminating experiences gained from projects not only amongst Groundwork trusts but also to others involved in environmental regeneration. The Department would therefore welcome comment on possible ways in which the performance of Groundwork may be improved through better collection and dissemination of good practice and transferable lessons.\n\nDETR's role in the creation of new trusts\n\n39. The Grants Memorandum, which defines the relationship between Groundwork and the Department, outlines the criteria used when evaluating proposals for the establishment of new trusts (including mergers of and extensions to existing trusts). These provide that:\n\nthe trust would further the Government's regeneration aims based on the creation of local public and private partnerships, local identity and accountability;\n\nthere should be demonstrable need for regeneration initiatives (in terms of indices of socio-economic deprivation and physical dereliction), which is not being met in the activities of existing local organisations;\n\nthere are opportunities for attracting sufficient private resources for environmental regeneration in order to progressively reduce the level of support the Trust receives from central government, and that there will be value for money in the use of public funds; and\n\nthe level of grant support provided by the Department shall be expected to decline over the life of the Trust.\n\n40. The assessment criteria, therefore, aims to ensure that new trusts should only be established where there is a real need for regeneration, where it is wanted by local partners and communities, and where there is a realistic prospect of available funding to support the trusts over a reasonable period of time.\n\n41. Whilst the current distribution of Trusts is very closely correlated with the distribution of need, there are nonetheless many areas with severe deprivation where there are no Groundwork Trusts. The Department accepts however that it would not be realistic to expect Groundwork to be working in all these areas, and that there are areas which are unlikely to benefit from a Trust. For example, areas where there is no local authority support for one, and areas where there are pockets of deprivation but no strong urban concentrations to provide a focus for Groundwork activities. The Government also recognises that there can be pockets of deprivation, which could benefit from Groundwork activities, within relatively prosperous areas of good environmental quality.\n\n42. Groundwork has sought to respond to such factors by proposing a \"light greening approach\". This approach would enable existing Groundwork trusts to provide their services to areas of whole counties or regions which are not currently served by a trust. It would be an alternative way of providing Groundwork services to 'pockets of deprivation' within a county or a region, which, in themselves, may not be capable of sustaining a new trust or the expansion of an existing one. The approach would enable:\n\nGroundwork services to be delivered in a way which better complements its regional development strategies/action plans, which are supported by the RDA's;\n\nGroundwork to be more responsive to national, regional and county priorities and local needs; and\n\nlocal partners across counties and regions to benefit from Groundwork's expertise in community-led regeneration, and capacity and partnership building.\n\n43. Whilst there may be merit in the light greening approach, the Department wishes to consider in more detail how it might work and its practical implications. The Department would therefore welcome comment on this light greening approach, and other issues related to the establishment of new trusts and alternative approaches to providing Groundwork activities.\n\nSummary\n\n44. The broad conclusions of the prior option stage of the FMPR is that the current arrangements for supporting Groundwork have been effective in delivering the Government's regeneration priorities, and it identifies particular benefits in retaining the current sponsorship and funding arrangements. However, in the light of an increasingly regional focus for planning and delivering regeneration initiatives, it would be consistent for DETR to consider supporting Groundwork Trusts via the RDAs or GO-Rs. This would initially be a ring-fenced fund for the Trusts but in due course as funds for which anyone could compete.\n\n45. The prior option stage also identified that Groundwork's operations could be improved by more effective monitoring and evaluation of the performance of projects; and disseminating good practice within and without the organisation. It also found that although the current distribution of Trusts is closely correlated with the distribution of need, there are nonetheless many areas with severe deprivation which might benefit from Groundwork activities.\n\n46. Accordingly, the Department would welcome comment on:\n\nthe relative merits of the two options for future DETR support to Groundwork - refining current arrangements or adopting a regional approach;\n\nthe desirability of reconsidering the 12-year rule and the proposal for tapering funding as outlined in paragraph 34;\n\nways to improve the monitoring of Groundwork outputs and performance of projects, and the evaluation and sharing of good practice; and\n\nissues related to the establishment of new trusts and alternative approaches to providing Groundwork activities.\n\nComments\n\n47.

This report has been prepared as one input to the FMPR of Groundwork (summer 1999). The brief for the study asks a number of questions, but two are central to the review. These are:\n\ndoes Groundwork deliver outputs in line with Government's regeneration objectives?\n\nis supporting Groundwork cost effective?\n\n2. The work has been undertaken in a number of ways:\n\na postal survey of Trust Executive Directors (EDs) to assemble background information on all Trusts\n\na data handling and mapping exercise to explore the existing distribution of Groundwork Trusts in relation to areas of need\n\nin-depth case studies at six Trusts chosen to provide a spread in terms of size and age of Trust, region, and types of regeneration problem\n\ninterviews with a wide range of relevant commentators including Groundwork partners, beneficiaries from Groundwork regeneration activities, alternative providers of regeneration initiatives/services, and corporate funders of Groundwork.\n\nThe Nature of Regeneration\n\n3. It is now being recognised that regeneration is a process. Ideally, regeneration activities aim to reinforce and support each other, creating a critical mass of change, which will become self-supporting. Achieving this requires a long-term commitment.\n\n4. A key change to be brought about through the regeneration process is from apathy to 'can do', empowering people and organisations to initiate and pursue the changes that they want to come about. Long term success and lasting benefits appear to be more likely when people work together in partnership rather than independently pursuing their own goals.\n\n5. Government objectives for regeneration promote this wide-ranging approach. They incorporate thinking about environmental sustainability into regeneration, and cover a wide spectrum of activity, which seeks to integrate action to bring about social, economic and environmental change. Action on social aspects of the agenda is targeted on those in greatest need. Finally, the objectives promote how to do things as well as what to do, laying particular emphasis on partnership ways of working.\n\nThe Groundwork Organisation\n\n6. Groundwork claims to be 'the leading environmental regeneration charity in the UK today', with a mission to bring about 'sustainable improvement in the local environment through partnerships and to contribute to economic and social regeneration'. It aspires to work with a wide range of local partners, very much in a 'bottom-up' style rooted in local needs and priorities, and expects to be a catalyst and enabler as much as a doer. The scope of their work includes local environmental renewal, involving local communities with a particular emphasis on the socially excluded, and action/training to better integrate the economy and the environment.\n\nGroundwork and Government Objectives\n\n7. The study has found that, in practice as well as in aspiration, Groundwork is addressing most aspects of the Government's regeneration priorities. There is a particular emphasis on groups who are often not reached through action at the local level, particularly local businesses and the socially excluded. An ability to make connections and to work in a variety of ways adapted to the needs of different parts of the community is a major contributor to the effectiveness of the outputs from Groundwork.\n\n8. There is some evidence that the benefits from Groundwork action and involvement are of lasting rather than short-term benefit. However, in areas with high levels of social depravation and economic disadvantage, it is unlikely that these benefits can be retained without continuing reinvestment.\n\n9. Other advantages that Groundwork brings include change at a significant scale, but achieved in an incremental manner in response to funding availability. In other words it is in the nature of Groundwork that it can operate in a flexible manner which is enabling the Government's complex agenda for regeneration to be translated into practical outputs. Many aspects of Groundwork provide a good model for changing practice amongst its partners, and the evidence is that the good practice is spreading in a manner somewhat akin to osmosis. Much more benefit could be gained from Groundwork if its innovations were better evaluated and a more systematic approach was taken to spreading best practice.\n\nGroundwork Partners\n\n10. The principal partners for Groundwork are local regeneration partnerships or trusts. Groundwork is setting an example with respect to partnership working and community involvement, which is helping to promote better practice amongst these partners.\n\n11. Four reasons stand out why partners value Groundwork. The Trusts are seen as being good at accessing money from a wide range of sources, at working with the community in a committed way, in enabling their partners to achieve their own corporate objectives for partnership working, and at delivering fast, well, reliably and responsively. The support for Groundwork from its partners can reasonably be described as outstanding.\n\nCost effectiveness of supporting Groundwork\n\n12. With straight comparators not available, only indirect assessment of Groundwork's value for money can be provided.\n\n13. Groundwork is well located with respect to the distribution of need when assessed at a broad spatial level (i.e. in relation to areas defined by local authority boundaries) and is therefore focussing its attention in areas requiring significant action for regeneration. Within these areas it is delivering things that might not otherwise get done, is achieving multiple outputs on projects and programmes, and is working across institutional, social and cultural divides. Groundwork is an innovator and a provider of good example. These attributes are all valuable in the search for effective approaches to regeneration.\n\n14. Groundwork itself perceives its effectiveness to be constrained by its funding regime. To an external observer, the perpetual search for funding keeps the organisation positive and creative. However, it is clear that there are problems for Trusts in securing funding which is not project specific and which enables new project development, extension of partnerships, and staff development. The Trusts feel that their potential is limited by these working arrangements and that reductions in non-project funding would reduce their effectiveness.\n\nNew locations and arrangements for Trusts\n\n15. There are locations requiring regeneration where Groundwork is not working. It would be unrealistic, and almost certainly inappropriate, for Groundwork to be working in all of these. Groundwork should only be active where it is wanted by its partners, where there is a real need for regeneration, and where there is an availability of funding (e.g. SRB, Landfill Tax) which will make Trust action secure over a reasonable period of time.\n\n16. Groundwork is considering a 'light greening' approach whereby Groundwork style action for regeneration is delivered without the need for establishing a new local Trust. This may bring advantages. A variety of models are in effect being tested in a number of different ways (e.g. work through trading companies, development work by regional offices) and there will be wide ranging lessons to be learnt from these approaches.\n\n17. Notwithstanding these lessons, it appears there is unlikely to be one model to serve all situations. To be effective, the approach adopted in each area will need to reflect local needs and circumstances. There will be a significant challenge in establishing the right relationships with 'outreach' areas in order to ensure that the full benefits of a working relationship with Groundwork are established.\n\nConclusions\n\n18. Like any organisation, Groundwork is not perfect and there are other organisations, which can and should deliver regeneration. Positive and effective regeneration is most likely to be served by having a variety of agencies involved, each contributing their own particular strengths.\n\n19. Notwithstanding this, the study concludes that, at their best, Groundwork Trusts are effective agents for change, working in ways, which facilitate regeneration. Without them, the process of regeneration would be much more difficult in many of their local areas. In combination with local partners and with each other, Trusts are able to demonstrate that the challenges of regeneration can be met and that significant change can be achieved.\n\n\n",

The fully trained Allocations and\nTenancies Officers are available Monday to Friday to discuss related housing\nmatters and there is a fully operational appeals system managed by the\nHousing Services Manager.\nRepairs and Decorations\nNormal Repairs\nIf you have any repairs needed within your quarter you should report them\nto your EMO (Estate Management Officer) with as much information as\npossible, giving your contact telephone number and times of access.\nPlease remember that if a workman attends your quarter and is for any\nreason unable to gain access, we may be presented with a bill for his call out\ncharge. On completion of the repair please inform your EMO if you believe\nthe work was not completed to a satisfactory standard. Payment will be\nwithheld until it has been rectified.\nMore details are under Repairs to Quarters later in this section.\nEmergency Repairs\nFor emergency repairs see page ?? \nKeeping Drains and Gutters Clear\nIt is your responsibility to keep clear the waste pipes inside the house; for\ninstance, to clean the grease trap under the sink when necessary. You should\nalso keep clear the gulley outside the house into which the bath, sink and\nwash basins drain. Your responsibility finishes at the U-bend in that gulley.\nIf the trouble is beyond the U-bend, then ask for help through your EMO.\nOn no account block the lavatory drains. Do not put insoluble solid mate-\nrial (including sanitary towels and the plastic portion of so-called ‘dispos-\nable’ nappies) down the lavatory. Put them instead, in paper or plastic bags,\nin the rubbish container. If the lavatories do get blocked it can be highly\nunpleasant both for you and the neighbours.\nOn no account empty used engine oil down drains.\nHousing Information & ServicesHousing Information & Services\n40 DEEPCUT GARRISON 2003\nWindow Cleaning\nYou are responsible for cleaning your windows, or getting them cleaned at\nyour own expense.\nBroken Windows\nYou are responsible for repairing broken windows in your quarter, or for\ngetting them repaired at your own expense. Repairs must be completed\nbefore handover. The large panes of glass in some modern quarters are\nexpensive, so you are advised to insure against breakages.\nWashing Machines (and Dishwashers)\nDamage can occur through hoses bursting and causing flooding. When the\nhouse is unoccupied washing machines should be disconnected (or if\nplumbed in with isolating taps, the taps turned off). If you are going away\nduring the winter you are advised to ensure that the washing machine itself\nis emptied of water. If you have a machine that empties through a hose into\nthe sink, take care that the end of the hose does not fall out of position and\nso pour water onto the floor. If in a flat, this will flood the flat below.\nServices\nGas and Electricity\nYou make your own arrangements with Southern Gas for gas, and with\nSouthern Electricity for electricity, and pay them direct.\nAll quarters with central heating have credit meters for both gas and elec-\ntricity. You are not allowed to change these meters for the pre-payment kind\n(ie coin-in-the-slot).\nMany families quarters get their electricity from the Military Power Station\ninstead of from Southern Electricity. The cost is the same. The only differ-\nence is that OC ASU sends you the bill, and you pay through your pay\naccount, except when you leave the Service when you pay in cash.\nBefore takeover you must sign an agreement for gas with Southern Gas, and\nfor electricity with Southern Electricity unless your FQ is supplied by the\nMilitary Power Station (your ASA can tell you if it is). Similarly you must\ngive Southern Gas/Southern Electricity at least 2 days notice of when you\nare leaving your FQ so they can read the meter and charge your account.\nMake sure that you pay your bills on time. DO NOT ignore warnings from\nthe Gas or Electricity Companies that they will cut you off if you do not\npay. They may do so. You will then have to pay a reconnection charge and\nperhaps legal charges and a deposit against future bills. This could cost you\n£50 or more. If you have had a final warning from the Gas or Electricity\nCompany, and either cannot pay it or are disputing the bill, go and see your\nUFO at once.\nRepairs to gas and electricity appliances are arranged through your EMO.\nThe only exception is a suspected gas leak. If you have reported a gas leak\nand get a bill for it from Southern Gas pass the bill to your EMO with\ndetails of what happened. But please note that this applies ONLY to gas\nleaks or suspected leaks. If you get Southern Gas to do any other work you\nwill have to pay the bill yourself.41\nDEEPCUT GARRISON 2003\nTelevision\nIf you have a television set you must have a current television licence. The\nServices Sound and Vision Corporation (SSVC) have television sets to rent\nor sell to service families; their office is near the Middle Hill NAAFI and\ntheir telephone number is Aldershot 24022.\nTelevision – Communal Aerials\nSome estates have communal aerials with a socket in each quarter. These\naerials give colour or black and white reception on BBC1, BBC2, ITV\n(Thames) and Channel 4. Some of these communal aerials also give recep-\ntion on ITV (Southern) as well. If your quarter is connected to a communal\naerial you are NOT allowed to put up an individual outdoor aerial.\nTelevision – Faults in Communal Aerials\nIf you think that there is a fault in the communal aerial you must first have\nthe set tested by a television firm to make sure that the set is not at fault.\n(You may omit this step if two or more of your neighbours have the same\napparent aerial fault affecting their sets.) You should then report the fault to\nyour EMO, on a piece of paper, giving your address, saying what the fault\nis, and either giving the name of the firm which tested your set and said it\nwas all right, or giving the address of the two other quarters suffering from\nthe same aerial fault. If you report the fault correctly and promptly it is\nusually put right within one working day.\nPrivate Telephones\nIf you want a private telephone in your quarter you should apply to British\nTelecom, Freephone 150. There is no need to get permission.\nIf you have a telephone in your quarter you should, when you leave, tell the\nTelephone Manager.  At the same time you should, if possible, find out if\nyour successor in the quarter wants to take on the telephone, and if so ask\nthe Telephone Manager to leave it for him. This will save the incoming\noccupant the installation charge, and may save him a long wait for the tele-\nphone.\nIf you have a telephone in your quarter and move to private accommodation\nyou are not allowed to have the telephone transferred to your new house.\nWhen you have lived outside the UK for two or more years and, on return,\napply for a telephone to be installed in your home, BT has decided to ask\nfor a security deposit. Because many service families do live abroad for long\nperiods during their career the MOD has come to an arrangement with BT\nthat, so long as the following 3 criteria are met, the need for a deposit will\nbe waived:\n1. A certificate of service identity is to be provided. This will originate\nfrom BT once your application for a telephone is received and be\ncompleted by your CO.\n2. You arrange to pay the bill quarterly by direct debit.\n3. The MOD will forward overdue bills to service debtors – to ensure\nthat bills are paid once the family is posted.\nHousing Information & ServicesHousing Information & Services\n42 DEEPCUT GARRISON 2003\nRefuse Collection\nThe local authorities collect rubbish once a week. You can find out which\nday they come from your neighbours. Any complaints should be actioned\nthrough the EMO.\nIf there are items which will not go into the rubbish container stack them\nneatly, in cardboard boxes, alongside the container. IT IS IMPORTANT\nTHAT NO FOOD OR UNHYGIENIC MATERIAL IS PUT IN THE CARD-\nBOARD BOXES.\nWhen the dustmen empty your container or plastic liner holder they leave an\nempty sack. They may leave an extra sack if you ask them.\nThe dustmen will not take away large items like broken prams, bicycles etc.\nYou should take such items to the official tip, details of which are shown on\nthe following pages. If you cannot do this contact your EMO for help.\nYou can get rid of unwanted cars/Caravans etc through firms of car break-\ners. You should make arrangements through the RMP (Ext 2365) or MOD\nPolice (Ext 2542 or 2544). Do not just abandon or dump the car. This is an\noffence under the military bye-laws, and disciplinary action is taken against\noffenders. It is also an offence under statute law and offenders can be \nprosecuted.\nOccupants Modifications\nOccupants Modifications to Quarters\nIf you wish to make any structural alterations to your quarter, at your own\nexpense, such as installing a gas or fixed electric fire, or putting in extra\npower points, then you must first get permission from the SAM, on a special\nform (4 copies). Your unit can show you the Garrison Order about this,\nwhich is No 22 (FQs).\nSatellite Dishes\nOccupants wishing to fit satellite dishes should do so on special occupants’\nmodifications forms obtainable through DHE SAM.\nThe dishes should conform to regulations which state that only one antenna\nmay be fitted and must be no bigger than 90 cm in diameter. The antenna\nmust not be higher than the highest point of the roof.\nMiscellaneous\nVisitors\nIf you occupy an MSQ and wish to have a visitor to stay for a period\nexceeding four weeks, you must request permission from your CO. If you\nwish to have a dependent relative to live with you, this request must be\npassed through your unit to the DHE. No additional furniture etc may be\nissued on account of visitors or dependent relatives and when permission is\ngiven for a dependent relative to live with you, it carries no entitlement to a\nlarger quarter. Occupants are not allowed to take in lodgers or paying\nguests.43\nDEEPCUT GARRISON 2003\nTraders\nNo one is allowed to sell goods or ask for custom in FQ estates unless they\nhave a pass, with photograph, signed by the DHE office. You are advised\nnot to buy goods from, nor enter into insurance or HP contracts with, any\ntraders in the FQ estates unless they have a pass. If unauthorised traders\napproach you, please report them (with vehicle number if possible) to the\nRMP information room (Ext 3393), or the MOD Police (Ext 2542 or 2544).\nHome Security\nPlease make every effort to discourage theft and vandalism. Make sure that\nyour quarter is secure when you go out. Check the credentials of any visitor\nyou do not know; if they have any official business in your quarter they\nshould be carrying a pass. Do not hesitate to ask to see the pass. Report any\ntheft, vandalism or untoward incident to the civil or MOD Police, or to\nyour EMO. See under Home Security in the Occupants’ Reference Section\nfor more details.\nInsurance of Personal Effects\nYou are strongly advised to take out an insurance policy on your personal\nproperty and the MOD accommodation stores in your quarter, especially\nagainst loss or damage caused by burst pipes, fire or theft. (See the\nClassified Index of Advertisers.) Where insurance companies will not insure\na quarter because the security arrangements of the quarter do not meet their\nrequirements, application can be made to the DHE for the locks to be modi-\nfied.\nShould damage to accommodation stores occur due to fire or flood, and\nyour carelessness caused the damage, you will be presented with a bill. A\nsimple ‘All Risks’ insurance policy can be effected. There is such a policy\navailable that covers HM Forces effects (as well as personal effects) which\nhas an optional liability extension. This would cover any bill raised by a\nService authority for accidental damage up to £500. Approximate cost is\n£10 per annum.\nDetails can be obtained from any reputable insurance broker and ASAs can\nadvise on the value of accommodation stores in any quarter.\nClothes Drying\nAttaching clothes lines to external fittings such as drainpipes, facia board,\netc is dangerous and is not permitted. Care should be taken with expanding\nclothes airers which can collapse with the weight of clothes and, if wrongly\nassembled, can be dangerous to children.\nPets\nDogs in Families Quarters. As a result of the ‘dog survey’ the Garrison\nStanding Order referring to dogs has been rewritten and all dogs within\nDeepcut Garrison must now be registered with the DHE Area Office ABRO.\nA Code of Conduct for dog owners in the Garrison has been produced and\ncan be found below.\nHousing Information & ServicesHousing Information & Services\n44 DEEPCUT GARRISON 2003\nIt has been decided that a maximum of one dog may be kept in a flat\n(including ground floor) and up to two dogs in a house. Permission to\nexceed these numbers will only be granted in exceptional cases by the DHE\nArea Manager. Registration forms can be obtained from your Unit Families\nOffice, EMO or from DHE Offices at the Connaught Centre and Middle\nHill.\nIf you have not already done so please register your dog now. If you have\nany queries please ring Aldershot Mil 8348 or Civ 01483 798348.\nCode of Conduct\n1. Occupants are to limit the number of dogs in a FQ as follows: • Flat\noccupants (including the ground floor): one dog. • House occupants:\ntwo dogs.\n2. Occupants are not to exceed this number without permission (which\nwill only be given in exceptional circumstances).\n3. Dogs are to be well cared for in every way and owners are to do as\nmuch as possible to ensure they do not cause a nuisance to their\nneighbours.\n4. Dogs are not to be allowed to foul the stairwells and immediate sur-\nrounds of flats. Owners are however to clear up if their dog fouls on\nthe estate and dispose of it hygienically. This is absolutely essential so\nthat the grassed area or pavements do not look an eyesore or more\nimportantly cause a health hazard for children. \n5. Dogs are to be on a lead whenever they are within the families\nquarter estate. If dogs need free range exercise they should be taken to\nappropriate areas out side the estate.\n6. Dog owners must respond positively when told by a neighbour that\ntheir dog is causing a nuisance and do all they can to improve the sit-\nuation.\n7. Any damage caused to the house or garden by the dog is to be made\ngood by the owners prior to handover.\n8. Dogs are to wear a collar tag bearing the owner’s name, address and\ntelephone number when outside the FQ.\n9. Dogs that cause a nuisance. Dogs that persistently cause a nuisance to\nneighbours or owners who do not abide by this code will have the\nprivilege of being able to keep a dog in an FQ withdrawn.\n10. For stray dogs contact the Dog Warden, Rushmoor Borough\nCouncil. Tel: 01252 398166.\nCats. If on posting you are unable to find a suitable home for your pet cat,\nthe Cats Protection League will guarantee to look after your pet and to find\nit another suitable home. This way is preferable to leaving the cat to fend\nfor itself or passing it onto neighbours who may, themselves, be posted\nshortly after your departure. The Cats Protection League can be contacted\nas follows:\nMrs R Young Frensham 825-3381 Mrs S Delima Aldershot 21385\nMrs S Warren Aldershot 28170\nNames of veterinary surgeons may be found in the Index of Advertisers at\nthe end of this Guide.45\nDEEPCUT GARRISON 2003\nAccommodation Services Matters\nFurnishing\nIt is the task of the ASU to provide and maintain the furniture in your\nquarter. You should remember that the items, both in quantity and quality,\nwhich are issued are authorised by the MOD and have been agreed for all\nthree Services. A separate inventory is maintained for each quarter and your\ncopy is handed to you when you take over your quarter; you should keep it\nin a safe place.\nExchanges\nThe ASU runs a system of exchange for FQ occupants. You should contact\nyour ASU to arrange for exchange of items.\nThe Wharf Scheme\nIf you have furniture of your own you may wish to have some of the Army\nfurniture removed. This is called the Wharf Scheme and can be arranged\nwhen you move into the FQ. Prior notification should be given when your\nApplication for Families Quarters (AFA1132) is submitted.\nThe wharfing requirements of occupants are normally made known on the\nAnnex to AFA1132 in advance of any move to a new station. When these\nare received at the ASU (for incoming occupants) arrangements will be made\nto adjust furniture holdings in FQs to meet the new occupants’ require-\nments. The Scheme does not apply to the following:\n(i) Carpets and curtains. (ii) Plug-in electrical equipment.\n(iii) Safety equipment. (iv) Dustbins. (v) Fireguards.\n(vi) Garden equipment.\nDue to limitations of both labour and transport there may, at times, be\ndelays between time of request for wharf and the actual removal of furni-\nture.\nYou may wharf once only during a 3 year tour of duty. Once items have\nbeen wharfed they cannot be rewharfed (reissued to your FQ) during your\nstay in the quarter, except in exceptional circumstances.\nPart Furnished Rate\nA part furnished rate for families quarters was approved by the Armed\nForces Pay Review Body (AFPRB) and introduced in 1992. When a Part\nFurnished Quarter is occupied the appropriate part furnished quartering\ncharge will apply. To qualify for the part furnished rate you must under-\ndraw or wharf furnishings to a total value of 50% or more of your entitle-\nment of families quarter furnishings. Contact your ASA for further details\nrelating to the calculation of the 50% requirement.\nUnfurnished FQs in the UK\nDefinition. An unfurnished families quarter is one from which all accommo-\ndation stores have normally been removed except for the following items:\nHousing Information & ServicesHousing Information & Services\n46 DEEPCUT GARRISON 2003\na. Carpet and curtains. b. Refrigerators (where issued).\nc. Cooker. d. Dustbins (when issued by ASU). e. Domestic vacuum\ncleaners.\nf. Portable heater (when issued). g. Fire extinguishers. h. Fire guards.\ni. Any safety equipment issued (smoke detectors etc).\nIn effect this means that no other accommodation stores are supplied and no\nprovisioning action is made for this unfurnished quarter during the occu-\npancy of the tenant requesting the Wharf. \nConditions of Eligibility\nAny Serviceman/woman who is entitled to a families quarter in the UK may\nopt for that quarter to be unfurnished without any pre-conditions of service.\nQuartering Charges. When an unfurnished FQ is occupied the appropriate\ncharge will apply.\nStorage and Removal Expenses. The quantities of furniture which may be\nconveyed at public expense on moves to or from an unfurnished residence\nare given in Chptr 7 of Regulations for Army Allowances and Charges\n(Army Code No10). This also shows the quantities of furniture which may\nbe stored at public expense when an officer/soldier is posted overseas and is\naccompanied by his family, subject to the provisions of Sect 3, Chptr 7 of\nRegulations for Army Allowances and Charges.\nSoft Furnishings\nThere is a fixed and limited amount of money available each year to buy\nsoft furnishings for families quarters. Carpets, curtains, covers and blankets\ncan be very expensive, as you will know if you have bought your own.\nPlease look after all the items in your quarter as if they were your own and\nhelp to avoid the shortages which result from unfair wear and damage.\nCleaning and Washing Soft Furnishings\nYou are responsible for washing or dry cleaning the following articles:–\nSheets, pillow slips, blankets, bedspreads, underlays, rugs, mats, loose covers\nand curtains. Mattresses and pillows are remade at public expense when\nthey become unserviceable due to fair wear and tear, but when this is neces-\nsary through neglect the cost will be charged to the occupant. Carpets are\ncleaned at public expense every 3 years, or on change of occupancy if\nrequired. If you consider additional cleaning necessary, consult your ASA.47\nDEEPCUT GARRISON 2003\nMarried Accompanied\nDefence Housing Executive (DHE)\nThe DHE is responsible for managing and maintaining all families accom-\nmodation on behalf of the housing Group in England, Scotland and Wales.\nThe DHE area office, which is the address for all Married Quarter applica-\ntions, is at:\nDHE, Aldershot Area Office D, Building 3, The ABRO Site, Ordnance\nRoad, Aldershot, Hants  GU11 2AA.\nThe Estate Office is located at Pirbright and the telephone number for the\nDHE Sub Area Manager (SAM) Moira Waterston is on 01483 798348.

In particular it identifies their\npolicy in dealing with ex-regulars.\nHousing Association opportunities\nHousing Associations (HAs) are taking an increasingly significant role in the\nprovision of public sector housing. Some HAs specialise in the rental needs\nof single people as well as family housing. JSHAO can provide contact\naddresses for HAs throughout the UK.\nMOD Nomination Scheme\nMOD has established a referral scheme with Housing Associations to\nprovide rented accommodation for people coming out of the Services. The\nScheme is based on the sale of surplus families quarters and operates in\nabout 200 locations in England & Scotland (local connections are not\nusually required). Service leavers (whether married or single) and \nseparated partners occupying quarters as irregular occupants can apply.\nContact JSHAO for more details.51\nDEEPCUT GARRISON 2003\nShared Ownership\nA number of housing associations build or modernise property for sale\nunder this government funded scheme. Initially, you buy a part of a property\noffered for sale by a housing association, and rent the part you do not own.\nEventually, you can buy more shares until you own the property outright. If\nyou cannot afford to get a large enough mortgage to buy in the usual way,\nshared ownership may be for you. \nHomebuy\nThis scheme is operated by selected Registered Social Landlords (RSL’s) in\nEngland and Wales.\nIf you qualify for Homebuy you will need to contribute 75% of the pur-\nchase price of the home through a mortgage and/or personal savings. The\nRSL will lend you the remaining 25% as an interest free Equity loan. There\nare no monthly payments on this loan. Instead, you repay it when you sell\nthe home. At that point you pay the RSL 25% of what the property is sold\nfor.  In Wales the RSL’s lend 30% of the initial value.\nPrivate Sector House Rental & Purchase\nJSHAO has various details on Private Sector options. We stock booklets on\nhouse purchase produced by the Council of Mortgage Lenders which\ncontain useful information about the steps to follow when buying a house\nand the pitfalls to avoid. We also have a comprehensive list of Estate Agents\nand Residential Letting Agents. This information is especially useful to per-\nsonnel serving abroad as it provides the opportunity to contact agents in the\nUK before repatriation.\nLong Service Advance of Pay Scheme\nThis is a Tri-service scheme to assist personnel in house purchase. There\nare a number of basic criteria for eligibility and conditions which apply to\nyou and the property. Full details of the scheme should be available within\nunits (or in summary from JSHAO). Do not commit yourself to buying a\nproperty until you receive confirmation of your eligibility from the Tri-\nService LSAP Centre.\nCommercial Initiatives\nA number of commercial organisations such as Banks, Building Societies,\nBuilders, Surveyors etc. put together special schemes and packages for\nService personnel. For current details contact the JSHAO.\nAnnington Homes, the purchaser of the FQ Estate, offer surplus Families\nQuarters for sale to the general public. They often offer Service persons a\ndiscount based upon length of service.\nSelf Build\nA small number of Service personnel will consider the possibility of building\nHousing Information & ServicesHousing Information & Services\n52 DEEPCUT GARRISON 2003\nor managing the building of their own house. Building your own house can\nsave a substantial amount of the cost of buying a new house from a tradi-\ntional builder. Want to find out more? Contact JSHAO.\nJSHAO Magazine\nJSHAO produce a monthly magazine called ‘Housing Matters’. Copies are\navailable at units, HIVEs, RRC’s etc. Additional copies may be obtained\nthrough JSHAO.\nSSAFA Forces Help’s Housing Advisory Service\nOnce you leave the Forces and/or MOD accommodation, you can still get\ninformation, help and advice with your housing problems from SSAFA\nForces Help. Contact their Housing Officer (Information) c/o JSHAO or\nring 01722 436400. NB: This service is also available to your dependants\nand wider family (parents, etc.) whilst you are still serving.\nHousing Associations with Service Links\nPlaces for People is one of the largest Housing Associations in the country\nmanaging over 38,000 properties. They have a specific commitment to\nhelping service leavers by aiming to allocate a proportion of the annual\nvacancies in their rental stock to ex-regulars. They are also committed to\ngiving favourable consideration to Service leavers who are first-time buyers\nand are interested in low-cost home ownership developments. Home\nHousing Group also has strong links with JSHAO. Currently JSHAO has a\nlarge nomination arrangement with the group.\nSPACES\nSingle Persons Accommodation Centre for the Ex-Services\nSPACES is designed to help single ex-regulars to find appropriate accommo-\ndation when they leave the Service. Through this service the project reduces\nthe likelihood of ex-services personnel becoming homeless or sleeping rough\nafter discharge.\nThe project is based within the Resettlement Welfare complex at Catterick,\nNorth Yorkshire.  It provides an accommodation placement service for\nsingle personnel being discharged from all three Services. Run by English\nChurches Housing Group in partnership with the MOD, who fund the\nproject.\nTel: 01748 833 797, Fax: 01748 835774, Catterick Mil: (94731) 2940.\nHow Can I Get More Information On These Options?\nJoint Service Housing Advice Office, HQ LAND, Erskine Barracks, Wilton,\nSalisbury, Wilts SP2 0AG.

We should support the United Nations resolution which was unanimously agreed. If we fail to stop Saddam developing weapons of mass destruction, other dictators will conclude that UN resolutions can be ignored, international law will not be enforced and other countries can develop similar weapons. WMD in the hands of a large number of countries, sometimes run by tyrants, with a lack of effective controls, would make the world a much more dangerous place. We must stop proliferation.\n\n\n\n‘I hope Saddam will comply with the UN resolution and disarm peacefully. If we disarm Saddam the message will be, UN resolutions matter, international law will be enforced, and other dictators will get the message that they cannot proliferate nuclear, chemical and biological weapons with impunity.’\n\n\n\nOn suggestions that this was a war on Islam, Mike O’Brien said:\n\n\n\n‘With two million Muslims living in Britain the idea that we would declare war on our own people is absurd. Islam is a mainstream British faith and adds to the richness of our society.\n\n\n\n‘In Kosovo, Britain helped stopped Milosevic’s ethnic cleansing of Kosovo Albanians who are Muslims. In Afghanistan, which I visited recently, we have been welcomed by Muslims as removing the yoke of Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Today Afghanistan is a Muslim country with three million children in schools, half of these are girls - something unthinkable under the Taliban. Neither of these conflicts involved oil or material gains for us. Yet we got involved because it was the right thing to do. Muslims benefited in both instances, due to our intervention.’\n\n\n\nTo those who say ‘it’s all about oil’ Mike O’Brien replied:\n\n\n\n‘Oil is an internationally traded commodity. If we wanted to buy Iraqi oil we could just cut a deal with Saddam today. He would be happy to sell oil to finance his building of WMD. Britain does not import oil from Iraq and we don’t need to. The US has made it clear that it has no plans to seize Iraq’s oil. Iraqi oil should belong to the Iraqi people.\n\n\n\n‘In fact, Saddam Hussein has creamed off 10% of oil revenues from the Oil for Food programme to rob his people of vital goods and spend some money on luxuries and components for WMD.’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to current Press Releases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

While we are making good progress in improving the level of public confidence in the criminal justice system, we still have a way to go.\"\n\nSpeaking ahead of a speech to Community Service Volunteers, he suggested that local visibility of police leaders and others responsible for tackling crime and disorder should be increased:\n\n\"I am interested in exploring options for strengthening local accountability and engagement, such as whether police authorities have a directly elected element or even be entirely elected?\"\n\nHe said that despite the Police having a highly visible role in society and communities, research showed the public had little understanding of just how the service was accountable.\n\n\"I am calling on the police, police authorities, Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships and others who care about policing in this country to join in the debate on how past good work can be built on to clarify and strengthen community involvement and accountability. It is difficult to engage and reassure people if they do not know who they are being policed by and how to have their say.\"\n\nHe added that the Attorney General is looking at ways to boost the profile and widen the role of local senior public prosecutors. The goal is to generate the sort of status they have in the US, and become much more visible to the communities they serve. \n\nThe Government's aim should be a society in which individuals and their families are empowered, enabled and supported to take part as active citizens, Mr Blunkett said. He added:\n\n\"In practice this means spreading assets across society, reforming the state and our public services so that they facilitate community involvement and help individuals to help themselves, and strengthening accountability and engagement with key services.\"\n\nThe Home Secretary also announced:\n\n\ta further ?4 million will be available to the Adventure Capital Fund - a new fund which supports a range of projects such as ensuring community safety to waste composting.\n\t?1 million for a new Centre for Active Citizenship to examine future policy development. The Centre will operate as a consortium of organisations, university departments and think tanks \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Links\n?\n Email the Prime Minister\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSend an email to Prime Minister Tony Blair\n\t\t\t\t\n\n?\n\n?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrime Minister's Questions\nWatch Prime Minister's Questions live here every Wednesday Parliament is in session\n\n?\n\n?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFrequently Asked Questions\nAnswers to our most frequently asked questions\n\n?\n\n?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLearn about the Cabinet\nLearn more about the Ministers who make up the Cabinet and its famous history\n\n?\n\n?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUseful Links\nUseful links to other government sites\n\n?\n\n\n\n\n|\n\t\t\tcopyright?|?contact the webteam?|?website feedback?|?privacy policy?|?advanced search?|?sitemap?|?accessibility?|?rss feed?|?\n\n\n\n\n",

The expression originally denoted keeping close to the shore by sailing off and on it.\n      \n\t\n OFFICER \n      \t\n        Officer Strength\nAt the end of the 1939/45 war, naval officers were about 14%\n        R.N., 12% R.N.R. and 74% R.N.V.R.\n      \n\t\n OFFING\t\n        In the Offing\nOld naval expression meaning near at hand; originally it meant a distance from the shore - i.e., towards the horizon.\n      \n\t\n OGGIN \n      \t \nThe Oggin\nModern sailors' slang for the sea; it is said to be derived from Hogwash, though some assert that it comes from a mispronouncement of Ocean. Synonyms are The Ditch, The Pond, The Drink, all three of which words are used by officers more often than\nOggin. \n      \n\t\n OGILVY \n      \t \nThe Ogilvy Medal\nThis medal was instituted in 1912 in memory of Captain F.C.A. Ogilvy who died on 18th December, 1909, from typhoid fever while in command of H.M.S. NATAL. The dividends from a sum of money given by officers of the Navy and certain friends and relatives are employed in providing a medal which is awarded annually, at the discretion of the Admiralty, to the officer who takes first place in the examination to quality for Lieutenant (TAS). Any balance that remains may be handed over to the winner of the medal. \n      \n\t\n OIL \n      \t \n Oil Fuel\nH.M.S. CRICKET was the first\nH.M. ship to be designed and built for oil burnings; she was launched in 1906, as one of five \"Insect\" class coastal destroyers, later reclassified as Torpedo Boats. Her displacement was 225 tons and her engines developed 3750\nh.p.\n\n The first British battleship KING EDWARD VII burned both coal and oil in 1905; H.M.S. QUEEN ELIZABETH (launched 1913) was the first British battleship to be designed and built to burn oil fuel only.  \n      \n\n\t\n OILY \n      \t \nOily Wads\n\nNaval nickname for the first British oil-burning torpedo boats (Nos. 1-36).\n\t\n OLD \n      \t\n        The Old Man\nNaval slang name for the Captain or Admiral. It is an expression borrowed from the Merchant Navy.\n\t\n OLERON \n      \t\n        The Laws of Oleron\nThe Laws of Oleron were the first code of laws for naval service; from them has descended the Naval Discipline Act of today. The Laws seem to have been instituted in Castile by King Alphonso X in the XIII century derived from the code founded in the republic of Rhodes and adopted by the Romans and other maritime powers of the Mediterranean. King Richard Coeur de Lion introduced these laws into Great Britain, having met them during the Crusades where the forces included a strong contingent from the island of\n        Oleron. The Laws were undoubtedly harsh - as they probably needed to be in their day; among them appears. \"If a robber be convicted of theft, boiling pitch shall be poured over his head and a shower of feathers shaken over to mark him\"; a murderer was to be tied to his victim's corpse and buried alive with it, either in land or in the sea. See the introduction to the Admiralty Memorandum on Court-Martial Procedure -\n        B.R. 11/1954.\n\t\n OPPO \n      \t \nNaval slang - short for opposite number - for the person doing the same job as one's self in another watch or ship. In the former case, since you relieved each other (in the old two-watch days), it behoved you to become friends; thus the word Oppo came to mean Chum. On a two-watch\nwatchbill, the name of a man's 'opposite number' in the other watch was shewn against his own name in the opposite column.\n\t\n OSBORNE \n      \t\n        Royal Naval College, Osbourne\nCalled for by the Selborne Scheme the college was built at Osborne House (Isle of Wight) on the site of the old stables. It was opened in September, 1903, well within a year of its inception. It was utilitarian rather than comfortable.\n Cadet entry at 12? started under the Selborne Scheme and ran till 1913; this gave cadets 2 years at Osborne followed by 2 years at Dartmouth. In 1913 this was changed to 1 year at Osborne and 3 years at Dartmouth. The R.N. College, Osborne, finally closed down in 1923; its ship-name had been H.M.S. RACER.\n      \n\n\t\n OUTSIDE \n      \t \nOutside-Walkee\nChinese pidgin-english for a Paddle steamer: a screw ship is an\n\"Inside-walkee\" ship.\n\t\n OVERCOAT\t\n        Overcoat : Oilskin : Raincoat\nUntil 1954 an overcoat was given to all new entries into the Navy and also an oilskin to men dressed as seamen (raincoat to men dressed in 'force-&-aft' rig). On 1st January, 1955, the issue of overcoats and oilskins was stopped, a double-breasted blue raincoat, with detachable warm lining, being issued instead to all new entries. The overcoat remains an optional item of kit; the oilskin is to disappear by April, 1957. Overcoats may be supplied on loan to ratings for wear on ceremonial occasions in the U.K. Foul weather wear will continue to be issued on loan to men whose duties make this necessary.\n      \n\t\nOWNER \n      \t\n        The Owner\nNaval slang name for the Commanding Officer - much more used in the Merchant Navy (whence the\n        R.N. borrowed it) than in the R.N.\n      \n\t\n OYSTER \n      \t\n Bombay Oyster\nA old maritime name for a laxative draught consisting of a double dose of caster oil in a glass of milk; a more modern name for such a laxative would be\n\"elephant-rouser\".\nPrairie-Oyster\nA morning-after reviver composed of port wine, worcester sauce, red pepper, mustard and the unbroken yolk of an egg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\tTop of page \n\n\t\t\tPrint \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t© Crown Copyright 2004.

Despite a brief detour to bike suppliers for running repairs, the team managed to cover 120 miles on the first day alone.  \n\n\n\nOn arrival at Hope House the team presented a cheque to the hospice for £1,000 raised by members of HMS Talent’s ship’s company through various fund-raising events including a sponsored Bungee Jump.  The team also supported the hospice’s Fun Day by manning some of the attractions raising a further £320.\n\n\n\nTeam leader Chief Petty Officer Nigel Bouckley said:  “We felt it was an ideal opportunity to get the guys out exercising and at the same time raise money for Hope House.”\n\n\n\nHMS Talent is currently undergoing a refit at Devonport Naval Base in Plymouth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\tTop of page \n\n\t\t\tPrint \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t© Crown Copyright 2004.

The PMOS reiterated that even though events were picking up momentum as 30 June approached it was still important to take the process step by step. \n\n\n \n\n\nAsked if there was a difference between the Government and Colin Powell over who would command troops after 30 June, the PMOS responded that there absolutely was not. It was important to be clear about what the draft UN Resolution said and there were two key words. One was \"consent\" and the other was \"co-ordination\". As Colin Powell had himself said 10 days ago if the Iraqi Interim Government wanted the multi-national force to leave, then it would leave, that was what consent meant. President Bush had underlined that full sovereignty meant full sovereignty as the PM had reflected yesterday. The Prime Minister had also reflected that there was a two level split over command: one was at the strategic level and the other the operational level. That split was a division that we in this country were very familiar with. It was a division that had operated in Northern Ireland for 30 years for example and in other areas where coalitions had worked as partners such as Bosnia, Afghanistan and Sierra Leone. The division was clear. If you were at the wrong end of a rocket-propelled grenade now you didn't have to phone a committee to ask how to respond. After 30 June whether you were British, American, Iraqi, Dutch or any other coalition member for that matter this would still be true.  Operational control would remain at the level of local decision making. US commanders would be in control of US troops. British commanders would remain in charge of British troops and Iraqi commanders would be in charge of Iraqi troops. What would change, as President Bush had said, was that after 30 June the CPA would disappear and not be replaced, instead there would be the Iraqi Interim Government. It would have a mechanism such as a national security committee that would agree and coordinate with the multinational force the broad strategic approach to security. It would decide the profile and balance of forces in particular areas. The change after 30 June would be that the Iraqi Interim Government would work in close coordination with the multinational force to decide these strategic issues. \n\n\n \n\n\nQuestioned as to how the attack on Falluja would be have been classified, the PMOS said that the Prime Minister had made his view absolutely clear in his press conference yesterday that it was a strategic decision. However once an operation began then the operational control was at the level of the local commander. The PMOS again drew attention to the wording in the resolution that recognised the importance of the consent of the sovereign government for the presence of the multinational force and the close coordination of the multinational force and the Interim Government. It was true that there were still technical arrangements that would have to be made, but that was true of any operation. What the resolution could not do was set out in black and white the precise arrangements for every eventuality and it was totally unrealistic to expect it to do so. What it did do however was set out very clearly the principles by which everyone would operate: consent by the Iraqi Government, and coordination between it and the multinational force.\n\n\n \n\n\nAsked about the composition of the national security committee mechanism the PMOS said that the precise make up of the mechanism was still being finalised and therefore yet to be decided. It would also have to be agreed by the incoming Interim Government, but what we may have was an Iraqi National Security Council that met with and coordinated security with the multinational force. If the Iraqis did not want a particular operation then, as the Prime Minister had said yesterday, they could of course say no. Equally however the Iraqis could not ask the multinational force to carry out an operation it did not believe to be right or believed too dangerous, it worked both ways. Asked if the veto applied to US troops the PMOS pointed out that that was the position for the multinational force. In response to further questioning the PMOS suggested that people needed to get away from the idea that the multinational force would have a different agenda from the Iraqi Interim Government. They would be precisely the same, namely stability and to increase the capacity of Iraqi security forces to take on responsibility as quickly as possible. The two sides shared the same goals and would therefore work out the best way of achieving those goals. Practical issues would come up and be debated and discussed, but practical issues would be resolved through practical arrangements rather than trying to find some ideological divide which was not there. The aim was to build on our experience and form the strongest ever level of cooperation between a sovereign Iraqi government and a coalition force, but as Colin Powell said we would only stay as long the Iraqis wanted us to. There would always be practical issues but the principles of consent and coordination were there in black and white in the UN resolution.\n\n\nIn response to the suggestion that this had still not reconciled Colin Powell's comments yesterday on Iraqi sovereignty and US troops with the Prime Minister's the PMOS read out what Colin Powell had said, \"They are sovereign. We are there at their consent, with their consent.\" Colin Powell had further said, \"U.S. forces remain under U.S. command and will do what is necessary to protect themselves.\" The PMOS reiterated our agreement with this point that if an agreed operation was started then of course you finished that operation. Operational control meant operational control and that was a concept everyone was deeply familiar with in this country and there was no disagreement with that. The key question was the strategic decisions about the balance of forces, the kinds of operation taken, the profiles, the balance between the growing capacity of the Iraqis and the role of the multinational force.\n\n\nAsked whether more British troops would not be sent till after 10 June the PMOS reminded journalists that a decision would be taken whenever the various elements involved had been taken into account and not based on any artificial deadlines.\n\n\nPRIME MINISTER\n\n\n \n\nAsked if he agreed with the Deputy Prime Minister that it was a question of if rather than when the Prime Minister fights the next election the PMOS said that the Prime Minister had set out his view of this yesterday at his press conference and as such he had nothing further to add.\n\n\n \n\n\nDAVID HILL\n\n\nAsked if the Prime Minister agreed with David Hill's alleged comments about the French airport disaster as reported in the press the PMOS told journalists that David had explained in his statement to the Daily Mail that his comment had been flippant and that this was where the matter should be left. Asked if David Hill would be apologising to the families of those who had died the PMOS said that as David had said in his statement as anyone who knows him would recognise that the last thing he would want was to cause offence to anyone. That was not his intention.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\nE-mail the Prime Minister\nSend a message to Prime Minister Tony Blair through this website.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n \n\t\nFilms: Inside No10 Downing Street\nWatch our exclusive film on life behind the most famous front door in the world.

It's now got a heart.  \nAnd it's got the wow factor - with great new architecture, from Brindleyplace to the new Bullring. \nThey're reusing the canals, the warehouses, the workshops - the old wasting assets brought back to life \nto serve the community. \nIt was here that we held the successful Urban Summit 2 years ago - where I set out the Government's \nnew agenda for housing and sustainable communities. At Manchester, next year, we are holding an \ninternational Sustainable Communities Summit, which will spell out our ideas for the future.  \nMany of you had a big part to play in shaping these new agendas and driving them forward. You've \nbeen delivering the decent homes, building more affordable homes, helping the homeless and the \nvulnerable, tackling low demand, providing more homes for key workers. \nCan I congratulate the housing associations and the Housing Corporation for what you've done. \nWhen I started this job back in 1997, I remember meeting Sir Brian Pearce and his team from the \nHousing Corporation. They spoke to me in some weird housing language.  \nThey told me that the TCI's too small. The HIP needs to be bigger. The RTB and the RTA are \nreducing our stock. And the ADP is not enough. Of course I said. Yes. Exactly. Precisely. And I said \nwhat about the SC? There's no SC!  \nNo sustainable communities! \nWell, now I see the Federation are on board for SC! \nBut housing's not about jargon - it's about creating sustainable communities: \nnull mixed communities,  \nnull prosperous communities,  \nnull cleaner, safer, greener communities  \nnull sustainable communities in places where people want to live.  \nThat's what we're about.  That's why we're here. That's why we're in business together. In business for \nneighbourhoods. \nIt's not always been like that.  \nDon't forget the mess we inherited in 1997: \nnull Boom bust economics. \nnull A £19 billion backlog of housing repairs.  \nnull Over 2 million homes in the social sector failing to meet a decent standard. \nnull Capital spending on housing cut in half. \n1 Speech to National Housing Federation Annual Conference \nnull House building at its lowest level for 70 years. \nnull More families in bed and breakfast. \nnull Over a million council houses sold off at knockdown prices, costing us billions in subsidy \nAnd top it off with the Housing Minister, Sir George Young, with his infamous complaint about \ntripping over rough sleepers on his way from the opera.  \nThat's the legacy we inherited.  \nA Government policy which was against social housing. It meant - \nnull Fewer houses in the public sector \nnull Higher rents \nnull More on housing benefit  \nnull More homelessness \nnull More repossessions and negative equity.  \nnull And ever more revenue subsidy. \nIn the first 2 years, we adopted the Tory Government's spending plans.  \nWe had to make tough decisions because we had to get economic stability, we had to get the national \ndebt down, and we had to get the public finances right. \nSpending was tight, but we did have the capital receipts which weren't being used for housing. You \nonly had to see the state of the housing stock to see that repairs were urgently needed. 5 million \npeople were living in substandard homes in the public sector.  \nThat's why we launched our decent homes programme and it's been a huge success. We've invested \nover £13 billion of public money on decent homes.  \nThrough the transfer programme, you've levered in another £5 billion of private money. That's a total \nof £18 billion invested in our decent homes programme. You've done a great job and thanks for that.  \nAs you know we also introduced ALMOs and the housing PFI scheme.  \nThey've all got a part to play.  \nWe've shown that public private partnerships work.  \nIn fact, we've cut the number of non-decent homes by over a million.  \nThey may not be new houses, but they're new homes to the people who live in them.  \n650,000 homes fitted with new central heating, 240,000 new kitchens and 180,000 new bathrooms. \nThose are the figures, but you only realise the true impact if you visit people like Molly, who I went \nto see in her council house in West London.  \nI was expecting to see a traditional bathroom- but she now had a specially converted wetroom which \nallowed her disabled husband, Joe, to have a bath in his disabled chair, in his own home. Before that, \nhe had to go to the centre down the road.  \nThat's the difference a decent home has made to him and Molly. \nBut we've still got a lot of work to do to make every social home decent by 2010. It's an ambitious \ntarget. We've made the money available - including a new £180 million gap funding scheme to \nsupport transfers where the homes have negative value. \n2 Speech to National Housing Federation Annual Conference \nIt's a double challenge. You've got to repair the stock you have and help improve homes transferred \nfrom local authorities.  \nThanks for the progress you're already making and I've every confidence that together we will meet \nthe target.  \nThat was the first phase of our programme, and it was from there that we started to develop the \nSustainable Communities Plan. \nWe needed a strategy that addressed the different housing problems in different regions:  \nnull high demand in the South,  \nnull low demand in the North,  \nnull and the need for sustainable communities rather than housing estates. \nWe needed to tackle the desperate shortage of homes in the South, as well as the problem of empty \nand abandoned homes in parts of the Midlands and the North. \nAnd it's much more than bricks and mortar. That's the lesson we've learnt from the past, when we built \nsoulless housing estates and tower blocks with their walkways in the sky. \nYes, housing is important - but it's more than that - it's about sustainable communities which provide \njobs, regeneration, transport, better public services, cleaner, safer, greener places to live. And we need \nthe raise the quality bar, and make sure that we get better planning, better architecture, better design, \nand better eco-efficiency. \nIt can be done.   And, I don't see any reason why we should settle for second best - when we know we \ncan match the best in the world. \nThat approach is at the heart of what we're trying to achieve in the £38 billion Sustainable \nCommunities Plan which I launched in February last year.  \nIt's under that Plan that we are: \nnull Doubling investment in social housing \nnull Doubling investment in key worker housing \nnull Doubling the money for affordable housing in rural areas \nnull Trebling investment in tackling low demand \nnull Increasing spending on decent homes \nnull Increasing spending on our most deprived areas \nnull And creating a new 'Safer and Stronger Communities Fund' to pay for more wardens, more parks \nand more green spaces. \nSo a lot's being done, and housing's right at the top of the political agenda.  \nBut as Kate Barker said in her Housing Review, the imbalances in our housing markets can't be \nsolved overnight.  \nBut for the first time a Government is facing up to the failure of housing markets and the challenge of \nlow demand and abandonment in parts of the North and Midlands. \nOur investment in housing market renewal is concentrated on the 9 Pathfinders and will triple to £450 \nmillion by 2008. This will help create sustainable communities in these areas of decline. It's a tall \norder but it can be done with your help. \n3 Speech to National Housing Federation Annual Conference \nIn the London and the South East, there's a different set of challenges. We're faced with a huge \nshortage of homes that has built up over decades. House prices have been rising much faster than \nwages, and the market has failed to deliver. \nThat's why we are building 200,000 extra homes in the Thames Gateway - the largest brownfield site \nin Western Europe -  and the other 3 Growth Areas. \nAnd it's why we are providing resources for an extra 10,000 social rented homes a year by 2008 - a \n50% increase compared with today. \nIndeed, over the next 3 years, we will provide over 115,000 new affordable homes for rent and low \ncost homeownership. \nWe're beginning to make an impact. The number of affordable homes is at last increasing again. With \nthe 4 new Growth Areas  - and our additional investment in housing - we will increase the supply of \nnew homes from 146,000 a year to 175,000. \nBut that is at the lower end of Kate Barker's recommendations. She said that, in order to create \nequilibrium and stability in the market, we might need as many as 100,000 more houses each year on \ntop of that! \nWhat we're doing is a huge improvement but this really shows the scale of the challenge that faces us. \nAnd the scale of this task means that we have to get the maximum number of quality homes built for \nthe money we have available. \nThe lack of affordable homes has a knock on effect on homelessness.  It's bound to. The numbers \nhave risen - but they've risen because we've widened the safety net and moved people off the streets \nand out of B&Bs and into better temporary accommodation. At the last count we'd reduced the \nnumber of children in bed and breakfast from over 6,000 to virtually zero. \nAnd the number of rough sleepers is down by nearly 75%.  \nBut, it's not just about giving people a roof over their head.   \nWe want to give them a permanent home of their own. \nYou've a big role to play in this, but it does mean much closer co-operation with the local authorities. \nWe have to ask to ourselves what is the best way to use our money to create sustainable communities.  \nIt is too evident that you can have housing estates and no community, but you cannot have a \nsustainable community without housing - houses to rent, houses for sale, public and private. And \nmuch more of them. \nHowever it is now overwhelmingly clear that the market system alone cannot provide sufficient \naffordable housing. And that social housing provision involving public finance subsidy is needed in \none form or another.  \nThe extent of subsidy can be seen in the discount provided for Right to Buy - which cost over £40 \nbillion. Whilst this increased home ownership by 1.7 million houses, the cost was a reduction of social \nhousing by 1.7 million homes, and a massive £19 billion disinvestment in the remaining public \nhousing. \nThe difficulties have become even more acute in our rural areas. I agree with your manifesto for \nneighbourhoods about more affordable homes in rural areas, where your efforts are well appreciated.  \nI do recognise the forceful demand for more land and more flexible use of housing funds which I am \nhappy to discuss further with you - and of course the Treasury. \nAs you are aware, we will continue the Right to Buy, although we have acted to restrict its abuse and \nhave reduced discounts in housing crisis areas.  \n4 Speech to National Housing Federation Annual Conference \nBut it has helped raise homeownership to 70% and make estates more mixed in their tenure. More \nmixed tenure.  Different types of tenants.  Private housing and social housing side by side. Some \n100% homeownership. Some part owned. Some rented. That will help make social housing more of a \npositive. Make it more attractive and more acceptable. \nOur challenge is to create communities where people want to live. Not places they want feel trapped. \nThat means we need more houses and more choice. \nIt's why I asked the Housing Corporation's previous Chairman Brenda Dean to produce a report on \nhow to develop a greater range of choice in the way people purchase a home, particularly people on \nlower incomes and first time buyers. \nBrenda said we could do a lot more to bring together the different types of programmes we have to \npromote homeownership. And she also said we can be a lot more creative in the ways we encourage \nhomeownership and still protect the existing social housing stock. \nThat's the kind of thinking I want you to develop and work on. \nWe need new thinking and new ideas.  \nBut this is not just for the policy mekons -  it's also about the hard economics. \nWe've got to drive down costs and we need to be more efficient. \nIt's costing more and more to build housing - and particularly, social housing. \nI have looked at the figures.  They're not pleasant. In fact, they're completely unacceptable. Despite \nsustained low inflation and low interest rates, the cost of building new social housing has risen by \n63% since 1997. That's more than three times the rate of inflation! \nThe average subsidy going into each Housing Association home for rent has more than doubled - \nfrom £27,000 in 1997 to £66,000 in 2004. \nAnd even then, I know you still have to top up with your own money, to make the sums add up. \nIn London, it's even worse. The average grant there has  increased to nearly £100,000.  That's every \n10 houses needing a subsidy of £1 million to meet this ever increasing housing inflation. It's \nunacceptable. \nIndeed the total amount of housing subsidies and grants amounts to over £14 billion, just to keep up \nwith the market price. \nJust compare our costs with our international competitors. In the last 7 years, building tender prices \nhave gone up by less than inflation in France and Italy. \nIn our own islands, Scottish homes cost a quarter less to build than English homes, because they use \nmodern methods of construction. \nWe've got to get better value for money. There must be a different way of doing things.  \nA similar story is evident in land prices which have been increasing at a rate of more than 15% a year. \nThat's bad for house prices, good for the phenomenal profits being made by the building industry - but \nsupported by ever increasing public subsidies. \nSo the Government has a part to play. We've got the Housing Corporation and English Partnerships \nworking hand in hand for greater efficiency and effectiveness. I thought about merging the two \norganisations, but instead I put the chairmen on each other's boards. That's certainly made the sparks \nfly! And together they're doing very well. \nAnd now we've set the Housing Corporation some pretty tough efficiency targets for the next three \nyears.  By 2008, we expect the whole social housing sector to deliver efficiency gains worth at least \n5 Speech to National Housing Federation Annual Conference \n£830 million a year. That includes an 8% real saving on the cost of new supply - which means \nswitching more money from administration to the provision of new and better housing. \nI know Jon Rouse is on your tail about this, with his Operating Costs Index.  And he's right to do so. \nWe need more efficiency for the sake of tenants and all those people who are in your homes and on \nthe your waiting lists. \nI don't want to play the numbers game, and maintaining quality is vital, but in some areas there are as \nmany as 50 or 70 housing associations.  Sometimes half a dozen in one street. Each with their own \noffices, their own maintenance, their own building contracts, their own management. We have to ask \nourselves - is this really the best way to do things? Does that deliver the maximum number of homes? \nAnd it's right to question whether we are managing our land supply in the most efficient way. Land is \na considerable part of the costs of providing homes, and I'm convinced that we can use land more \neffectively.  \nWith land prices so high, there must be a better way of doing it. It's crazy that we have been \nsubsidising housing for key workers in our hospitals, our schools and our police - because you can't \nhave sustainable communities without these essential public service workers  - and yet we've been \nselling off NHS and other public land to the highest bidder!  \nI then have to go to the Treasury to ask for more subsidy to provide more housing. We do need a more \nefficient and more effective way of using public land - a more comprehensive form of land \nmanagement. \nThat's why we're now making use of surplus NHS and Ministry of Defence land for new housing. And \nthere's certainly more we can do with local authority land. \nLand's an important factor, but we've got to get construction costs down as well. Modern methods of \nconstruction is one way of doing this. \nI'm encouraged by your response to the £250 million Challenge Fund to encourage more innovation.  \nWe're building schemes in half the time - that's good - but why are the costs still the same as a \ntraditionally built house.  That doesn't make sense. Surely time is money? Where are the economies of \nscale? Where are the efficiency gains? There seem to be too many one-off schemes. \nTogether, we've got to be sharper and smarter. \nYou already working with the rest of the public sector, and delivering extra homes through \nimaginative new partnerships with local authorities.  \nThat's great, but we need to go further. I will be setting out new ideas about joint working in my 5 \nYear Departmental Plan which I'll be publishing shortly. \nSome of the ideas are in the Housing Bill, which, as you know, allows the private sector to bid for \nfunds from the Housing Corporation. That shouldn't be seen as a threat, but as an opportunity to do \nnew business with new and established partners. \nSome of you are already creating new partnerships, not just with new housing, but with regeneration \nand neighbourhood renewal schemes. I want to support that and I particularly want to congratulate \nyou on the first anniversary of \"In Business for Neighbourhoods\".  \nIn Business for Neighbourhoods is a great idea because it about linking housing with jobs, welfare \nservices, health, care in the community, and education. It's about creating safer, cleaner, greener \nplaces to live. \nIt puts tenants first.   \nSo let's not forget what you've achieved. \n6 Speech to National Housing Federation Annual Conference \nI was reminded of what we've and how things have changed when I went to the Housing Corporation' \n40th Birthday. They showed Cathy Come Home - I've got the DVD. \nYou know it brought back memories of what it was like in the 60's. \nNearly 40 years ago 'Cathy Come Home' shocked a nation. It powerfully showed the devastating \nconsequences of living in a society where there was little support and no choice. \nCathy got married and was really enthusiastic about the future. You remember, she wanted a family, a \nnice house of her own, and even a Jag!  \nIt all started to go badly wrong when a child arrived.  The kid wasn't welcome. \nShe put herself on the waiting list, but it didn't make any difference. \nShe was then forced into short term emergency accommodation, where she had to separate from her \nhusband. He went off looking for work and she was left on her own. In desperation, she ended up with \nher child in a caravan, but that wasn't safe. The residents didn't like it and set the caravan on fire. The \nlast scene was heart breaking when she was left to sleep on the street and in the railway station - and \nwhen they took the child away from her. And left her homeless and all alone. \nThat doesn't happen today. We don't kick people out on the street, we don't take kids away from \nfamilies, we don't leave people without support. \nToday Cathy would want a decent home, and to have choice between a home to rent, if she wants, and \nthe opportunity to buy a home, or even part-buy, a home of her own.   \nShe wants choice and a community to live and work in. We're making that happen. We're working \ntogether to give the Cathys of today the home and the choices they deserve. \nI'm proud of what we've done. But the Cathy of today wants more choice, and place where she can \nfeel proud, safe and secure. \nOur task is not to just give Cathy a home, but to give her a community.  \nA sustainable community.  \nThat's the challenge for all of us.  \nThank you.  \n22 September 2004 \n7 \n",

They \n        are to set up a ten-bed hospital to provide routine treatment for the \n        British soldiers stationed in Sierra Leone.\n\n      The field hospital \n        unit is deploying to provide short-term medical cover whilst the Indian \n        UN hospital departs and the next hospital sets up. British soldiers will \n        then continue to make use of the UN hospital once the changeover is complete.\n\n      \"We will also be trying \n        out a new computer patient data tracking system which sends the notes \n        with the patient and enables us to see which stages they are at in the \n        medical system and which they have been through,\" said Major Jem Langley, \n        the hospital's physiotherapist.\n\n      When they arrive in \n        the country they will have to acclimatise themselves to the heat and humidity. \n        At present the temperatures are reported to be in the high eighties Fahrenheit \n        and the humidity about 95 per cent.\n\n      34 Field Hospital \n        sends individuals on a regular basis to the Balkans and deployed as a \n        unit to Kosovo in December 1999. The small ten bed hospital deploying \n        to Sierra Leone will include a number of specialist medical staff such \n        as consultants, doctors, theatre nurses and accident and emergency staff \n        normally employed in military hospitals by the Defence Secondary Care \n        Agency.\n\n         \n        \n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n        \n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n",

These officers, and those representing other States\n      Parties to the Europol Convention, will work from the Europol\n      Headquarters in The Hague, but will be employed by and remain\n      under the administrative control of the national criminal\n      intelligence services they represent.  The Exchange of Notes\n      implements the obligation in Article 41(2) of the Europol\n      Convention.\n\n      The main obligations are on the Netherlands (the Host\n      Government).\n\n      Similar Notes are in the process of being exchanged between the\n      Netherlands and other States Parties to the Europol Convention.\n\n      Ministerial Responsibility\n\n      The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs is\n      responsible for agreements between the United Kingdom and other\n      States and for policy in relation to the granting of privileges\n      and immunities.\n\n      Policy Consideration\n\n      (i)  General\n\n      United Kingdom support for the establishment of a European\n      Police Office was signified by HMG's accession to the Europol\n      Convention signed on 26 July 1995 (Cm 3050).  The role of\n      Europol and Liaison Officers in exchanging and developing\n      intelligence between Member States should help to make a\n      significant impact on international drug trafficking and\n      generally on organised crime.  Privileges and immunities in the\n      Netherlands are necessary to facilitate the performance of the\n      functions of the Liaison Officers.\n\n      (ii) Financial\n\n      None for FCO but NCIS have made budgetary provision for #250,000\n      to cover the costs of sending three Liaison Officers to the\n      Hague and of setting up a small office there.\n\n      Implementation\n\n      The Exchange of Notes shall enter into force on the first day of\n      the month following the day on which both the United Kingdom and\n      the Netherlands have notified each other that the legal\n      requirements for entry into force have been complied with.  No\n      implementing legislation is required in the United Kingdom.\n\n      Consultations\n\n      The Home Office, HM Customs and Excise, the National Criminal\n      Intelligence Service and the Police Federation of England and\n      Wales have been consulted.  All are in agreement with the text\n      of the Notes.\n\n      Presented to Parliament\n\n      March 1999\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to Explanatory Memoranda\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tOther Explanatory Memoranda Presented to Parliament in 2004\t\t\t\tExplanatory Memoranda Presented to Parliament in 2003\t\n\t\n\t\t\tExplanatory Memoranda Presented to Parliament in 2002\t\t\t\tExplanatory Memoranda Presented to Parliament in 2001\t\n\t\n\t\t\tExplanatory Memoranda Presented to Parliament in 2000\t\t\t\tExplanatory Memoranda Presented to Parliament in 1999\t\n\t\n\t\t\tExplanatory Memoranda Presented to Parliament in 1998\t\t\t\tExplanatory Memoranda Presented to Parliament in 1997\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\tNews\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\tPractice & procedures\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\tEnquiries service\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\tDepositary\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\tPublication\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\tTreaty Command Papers\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\tExplanatory Memoranda\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\tUN Registration\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\tLists of treaties\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\tUseful links\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\tTreaty texts\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\tUK Overseas Territories\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\tVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Campbeltown is the capital of Kintyre and is beautifully set within a deep loch, sheltered by Davaar Island and picturesque surrounding hills. The town sits on the south end of a peninsula bordered on one side by the Atlantic and on the other the Firth of Clyde.\n\n\n\nThe ships company mixed well with the local population and enjoyed the fine hospitality on offer, each mess reacquainting their connections with affiliated bars. Indeed a football match was arranged between the ship’s team and Whiskey Macs, a local pub affiliated to the sailors’ mess. Whiskey Macs came out on top with a 5-3 victory. HMS Campbeltown’s goals were scored by hotshots CPO(WEA) Andy Davy with 2, and OM(W) Rob Nelson.\n\nA cocktail party took place on the flight deck for members of the ship’s crew and local dignitaries witnessing a ceremonial sunset on the first night in.\n\n\n\nDuring the three-day visit many local associations were invited onboard. TS Campbeltown and the local Dalintober Primary School thoroughly enjoyed their tour around the ship, with the children hugely impressed by sitting in the Captains chair on the Bridge and visiting the mess decks. The children were also shown the ship’s fire fighting and damage control equipment and allowed to practice wearing Breathing Apparatus sets. The tour concluded with an entertaining party including a quiz and hot dog buffet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA careers forum was hosted by the wardroom involving teachers from Campbeltown’s Grammar School and members of the Careers Advice centre in Glasgow. Led by ship’s gardener CPO(MEA) Roy Burdon, 20 members of the Ship’s Company over a 2 day period, used their green fingers to help with a community garden project. The Kintyre Environmental Group have been working as part of Kintyre Healthy Living Partnership to develop a garden as a community resource for the production of organic fruit and vegetables. The garden is being set up within the extensive walled garden at the rear of Auchinlee Church of Scotland Eventide Home. John and Gail Aiken have been instrumental in running the project and were impressed with the help offered by the ship to the local community. \n\n\n\nHMS Campbeltown left her hometown for NATO exercises, but before that the ship took part in Scottish Navy Days in Helensburgh. Fifteen veterans, that the Petty Officer’s Mess had met in Caen a couple of weeks earlier at the D-Day commemorations, had the chance to visit the ship whilst at anchor. They where treated to a fine display by the Red Arrows whilst enjoying a glass of Champagne and a plate of strawberries!\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\tTop of page \n\n\t\t\tPrint \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t© Crown Copyright 2004.

It saw early action during the raid on Dieppe in August of that year. From 1943 to 1945 the Commando was involved in the Italian Campaign, at Termoli, Lake Comacchio and subsequently in Yugoslavia. For its decisive action the Commando was awarded the Termoli battle honour. \n\n\n\nFollowing the second world war the Commando was deeply involved in Palestine acting as the rearguard in the Protectorate, leaving in 1948. They subsequently undertook security duties in Cyprus, Hong Kong and Egypt before moving to Singapore in 1961, where it was involved in operations during the confrontation with Indonesia throughout the following decade. \n\n\n\nIn 1971 the Commando left Singapore and re-established itself in Seaton Barracks, Plymouth. Over the next decade the Commando found itself deployed to Northern Ireland four times and also undertook an unexpected two month tour in Cyprus after the invasion by the Turkish Army. \n\n\n\nIn 1982, following the Argentinean invasion of the Falkland Islands, the Commando deployed on Operation Corporate. On 21 May the Commando were among the first troops ashore and secured the beachhead at San Carlos. The Unit was subsequently split having two companies attached to the Welsh Guards, preparing to attack Port Stanley, when the Argentinean surrender came. \n\n\n\nOn their return the Commando spent the rest of the decade involved in a variety of tasks including two Northern Ireland tours to South Armagh, a six-month Peace-Keeping tour in Cyprus and a six month operational tour in Belize. During the tour in Cyprus the Commando was awarded the Wilkinson Sword of Peace for the third time. Also during this period, in 1983, the Commando relocated to Norton Manor Camp near Taunton. \n\n\n\nIn 1991 the Unit undertook its first Norway deployment but found itself undergoing a dramatic climatic change when, due to the Gulf War, it deployed to Northern Iraq to ensure the security of Kurdish refugees. Northern Ireland tours, Norway winter deployments and a major Asia-Pacific Exercise kept the Commando busy through the following years. \n\n\n\nIn 1998 a substantial part of the Commando deployed to the Congo to ensure the safe evacuation of UK nationals from Kinshasa City. \n\n\n\nThe new millennium saw the Commando deploy to Northern Ireland and on their return they were the first Commando to reorganise under a new structural concept called Commando 21. \n\n\n\nThe Unit deployed in its entirety in January 2003, initially part of the Naval Task Group (NTG) 03 in HMS Ocean, Ark Royal and RFAs Sir Galahad and Tristram.  The group sailed through the Mediterranean, after a brief stop at Cyprus, continuing through the Suez Canal bound for the Arabian Gulf.  The United Nations were engaged in diplomatic efforts to avoid the need for military intervention in Iraq as the Unit was busy rehearsing in the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait for possible operations against Sadaam Hussein’s repressive regime.\n\nIn March 2003 a coalition force, under the overall command of the United States, entered Iraq with the expressed intention of liberating its population from persecution and removing the intolerable threat to global security posed by its dictator.\n\n\n\nDuring Operation TELIC, the liberation of Iraq, on the night of 20 March 2003, 40 Commando, under the command of Lt Col G K Messenger OBE, mounted an amphibious helicopter assault to seize key Iraqi oil infrastructure on the Al Faw peninsula.  As the first conventional troops on the ground, the strategic significance of the operation was immense and, as the Divisional Main Effort, the assault was supported by a vast array of coalition firepower.\n\n\n\nThe Commando Group’s role in the success of the coalition operation in Iraq was pivotal and profound.  In a two-week period of intense operations, it secured key oil infrastructure, cleared a large expanse of enemy held terrain, and defeated a major enemy stronghold on the periphery of Basra, killing over 150 Iraqi soldiers and taking 440 prisoners.\n\n\n\n2004 has seen the Unit’s return to Iraq as part of a multi-national division peace-support operation.  Under the command of Lt Col R W Watts OBE, it has been instrumental in maintaining the security of the country’s infrastructure with particular attention being paid to the oil-pipelines in the southern region that keep the economic ‘life-blood’ of Iraq flowing.  Additionally, the Commando has been responsible for convoy protection, counter insurgency and border security operations.\n\n\n\nAs the role of the Commando develops it is increasingly contributing to the development of the fledgling security forces within Iraq and the Unit’s commitment, in-theatre, until early 2005, will see it well placed to assist in the country’s forthcoming landmark elections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\tTop of page \n\n\t\t\tPrint \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t© Crown Copyright 2004.

The principle underlying selection was that the charities should include representation from our affiliated regions of Weymouth and Portland, our base port of Plymouth and a Royal Naval charity. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Islanders Club for Young People\n\n\t\n\nBased on the Isle of Portland, this charity sets out to raise funds for disadvantaged young people in Portland, Dorset and was the adopted charity during his tenure of the former Mayor of Portland Councillor Les Ames.  The Ship’s first charitable earnings prior to commissioning, from a horseracing evening during Contractors’ Sea Trials in the Summer of 2000, were presented to Les during his visit to the Ship whilst still in build on the Clyde in October 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\nWestfield College, Weymouth\n\n\n\nWestfield College cares for and educates autistic children from the Weymouth Area.  The Ship hosted a lively visit by a party from the College during her first visit to Portland in June 2001 and looks forward to future exchanges whenever possible.  Westfield College was the recipient of the Ship’s first fundraising in commission, a sponsored beard-growing competition! \n\n\n\n\n\nHCPT[RN]  - The Pilgrimage Trust\n\n\n\nHCPT – The Pilgrimage Trust was founded shortly after the Second World War by a former Royal Naval Medical Officer.  Each year some 2000 handicapped children, assisted by around 3000 helpers, spend Easter Week in Lourdes for a Pilgrimage Holiday, providing them with a week to remember as well as a valuable period of respite for their families and carers at home. \n\n\n\nThe Trust consists of several hundred groups established up and down the United Kingdom, with three made up of Royal Naval personnel, in Devonport, Portsmouth and Faslane.  The Royal Naval Groups set out to enable handicapped dependants of serving RN personnel to participate each year, supported by serving RN personnel acting as helpers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fighting Spirit\n\n\n\nBased in HMS PORTLAND’s base port of Plymouth, The Fighting Spirit was founded by Dr Sheila Cassidy.  The organisation sets out to provide therapeutic support to sufferers of breast cancer in Devon and Cornwall and to promote the power of positive thought as a means to overcome the condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© Crown Copyright 2004.

The important thing was that there was consensus and coordination. Reality would no doubt be complex enough without having to invent hypotheticals. We would deal with reality in the same ways as we had dealt with reality in Bosnia and in the same way we had dealt with reality in Afghanistan and other areas where these issues had been faced. As he had mentioned in his morning briefing the important point was that the UN resolution had it in black and white that we were only there after 30 June with the consent of the Iraqi Government and that we would be working to coordinate the multinational force with the wishes of the Iraqi Government. There was a clear distinction in any military operation between setting the broad strategy and the operation of that strategy on the ground. The PMOS set out again that people should not have the idea that somehow or other the goal of the multinational force was different from that of the Iraqi government. The goal was the same: stability on the ground and as quick a transfer of responsibility to the Iraqi forces as they are capable of taking. \nAsked if Jeremy Greenstock had been saying at lunchtime that the rules governing US and UK troops in relation to what was operational could be different, the PMOS thought that what he had been saying was that clearly there have to be arrangements made, but these technical arrangements would be made. The principle of consent was one that was reflected in the comments of President Bush and in the comments of Colin Powell and they were there in black and white in the resolution. Asked if the exchange of letters between the US and UK Governments with the Iraqi Government would cover these sorts of technical rules of engagement the PMOS said that the technical arrangements would be covered in those letters. However, you cannot set down in black and white every eventuality, you have to recognise that practical issues would arise which would be address at a local practical level. If difficulties arose there would be a mechanism at the national security level and an interface between it and the multinational force for resolving those issues. Every operation took into account a strategic framework and that strategic framework took into account the sort of sensitivities that are out there, but we would not deal in hypothetical scenarios because the reality was always more complicated and more multifaceted than those scenarios. \nAmnesty Report \nAsked what the Prime Minister's reaction to the amnesty report that criticised the war on terror as being the worst attack on human rights since the second world war the PMOS said that the Government would no doubt want to study the report in full before making any response and he would not comment on phrases seemingly designed to make headlines. If it came to considering the worst atrocities against human rights one would have to take into account what Saddam did in terms of 400,000 mass graves in Iraq and you would also have to take into account what Al Qaeda did in one day in America. \nDeputy Prime Minister \nAsked if the Prime Minister would react to being compared to Harold Wilson by the Deputy Prime Minister the PMOS said that he had not seen the DPM's comments and the comments are a matter for the DPM. The Prime Minister would be carrying on his job as normal. In response to further questioning the PMOS restated that the Prime Minister had set on his position on the matter and that he had nothing further to add.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Links\n \n Email the Prime Minister\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSend an email to Prime Minister Tony Blair\n\t\t\t\t\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrime Minister's Questions\nWatch Prime Minister's Questions live here every Wednesday Parliament is in session\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tFrequently Asked Questions\nAnswers to our most frequently asked questions\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLearn about the Cabinet\nLearn more about the Ministers who make up the Cabinet and its famous history\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUseful Links\nUseful links to other government sites\n\n \n\n\n\n\n|\n\t\t\tcopyright | contact the webteam | website feedback | privacy policy | advanced search | sitemap | accessibility | rss feed | \n\n\n\n\n",

The company is singular in that the productions are re-choreographed to suit any venue and the company is, every year pushing back the pre-conceived notion of classical ballet as an expensive elitist art form.\n\n\n\nAll this has been achieved with NO major funding for over ten years, and the company continues to rely on audience and venue loyalty for its survival.

A small crew of 8 volunteers had a fantastic week learning how to sail a yacht, visiting several picturesque harbours and fully living the life of a ?yachtie?.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the budding yachtmasters were ?messing about in boats? other members of the Ship?s Company were busy making a small piece of Naval history by becoming the first warship to enter a crew in the Royal Navy Field Gun Competition.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn over 100 years of competition, heralding from the Boer War, no Ship-of-the-line has ever entered a Crew and for a lean-manned Type 23 frigate this was no small achievement.  A 30 man squad trained hard for 4 weeks prior to the competition learning how to manoeuvre the gun strip it down and reassemble it as fast as possible or as sailors would say, ?at the speed of naval gunfire?.  At the end of the 4 weeks the final 18-man crew was achieving competition winning times and expectation was high around the Fleet.  However, luck was not on the Ship?s side on the day of the Competition as the 2 crew members were injured during the first 2 timed runs which had to be abandoned.  This automatically placed the Kent Crew in the Runner-up Final. Amazingly, they had only a couple of hours to train a substitute in a critical position but, MEM Smith was up to the challenge and the crew ran home in a very commendable 2nd place.  Their courage and determination was a fine example of what can be achieved with proper planning and personal effort however, the Ship is also very thankful for the support provided by our Sponsors, Shepherd Neame Brewery, the Mercers Company and the staff of the Naval Base Commander at Portsmouth.\n\n\n\nImmediately following the Field Gun Competition HMS Kent set sail for Pre-Deployment training with Flag Officer Sea Training (FOST) Staff.  Cobwebs were firmly swept aside as KENT, along with other Frigates and Destroyers, conducted numerous imaginary wars off the coast of Devon and Cornwall and after two weeks of late nights and very early mornings, the Ship has re-emerged as a ?sharp? fighting unit.  Ready for action, HMS Kent can now look forward to sailing for a NATO Deployment in the Mediterranean which will commence in Aug.  HMS Edinburgh is currently on task in the Med and will be keenly awaiting our arrival which will allow her to return home for a  well deserved rest.\n\n\n\nBefore departing UK the Ship?s company will be busy stocking the ship with everything that we will need for a the 4 month trip and making personal preparations to ensure our homes and families are properly looked after whilst we are away.  Everyone will also get 2 weeks Summer Leave to get fully rested before we go. Gibraltar will be our first port of call as we make our way into the Med and the next update to this website will be published from there.  Between now and then we would like to wish all our readers a peaceful, pleasant and happy Summer.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\tTop of page \n\n\t\t\tPrint \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t?

In the event, the Constitution is in almost total contravention of the terms of reference. \n\nThe Bruges Group commissioned a leading Barrister, Leolin Price, CBE, QC - to give a legal opinion on the draft Constitution. He concluded that it was “unacceptably centralising, authoritarian and unaccountable” and that there were no conceivable amendments that could make it acceptable to a responsible UK Government. \n\nBritain submitted over 200 amendments to the Convention; only 11 were accepted. Those rejected include all of our vital issues – the ‘red lines’.\n\nTony Blair never objected to the highjacking of the Convention; his vital amendments were rejected, yet he tells us that the Constitution is 95% acceptable!\n\n\n\nEvolution of the Constitution.\n\nThe British Government has passed power to Brussels either directly or through Qualified Majority Voting (about 180 areas). The Constitution defines changes far more fundamental than the concessions to date. David Heathcoat-Amory MP, who served as a member on the Convention, states that most domestic policy areas will be opened up for legislation at Union level; national vetoes will largely disappear. Part One, the Constitutional Structure, will be almost entirely new. The sections on foreign policy and defence, criminal justice and immigration are unrecognisably different from the existing treaty articles. (For example, on immigration the Union will decide who goes to what country and on what terms; only the Commission can make proposals and voting is by qualified majority). \n\nThere is no way in which this can be just a ‘tidying up’ exercise!\n\n\n\nThe Future.\n\nGermany and France have stated that they expect no major changes to be made to the concept of the Constitution. Mr Heathcoat-Amory is convinced that the essential architecture of the Constitution and new Union is settled. So Tony Blair has little chance of winning on his vital issues of taxation, foreign policy, etc \n\nYet Tony Blair insists that, as there will be no large constitutional changes, a referendum is unnecessary\n\n\n\nTo quote Mr Heathcoat-Amory: “The Government’s refusal to admit a referendum is based on deceit and cowardice: deceit, in trying to disguise the importance of the undertaking; cowardice, in not having confidence in their own arguments. This must be challenged by all who believe that democracy is more important than expedience, and that Constitutions must be decided by the people”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n\t\n\n\n\n                \t\n                            \n\n                            \n                            \n                                318 reads  \n                            \n\n                            \n                            \n\n                            \n                            \n                                2 replies  \n                            \n                        \n\n\n\n                \t\n                            \t\n                                            << previous thread    \n                                        \t\n                                            < previous    \n                                        \t\n                                            next >    \n                                        \t\n                                            next thread >>    \n                                        \n\t\n\n\n                        \n\n\n\n                \n                \t\n                            \n\n                            \n                                    Reply    \n                            \n\n                            \n                            \n\n                            \n                            \n                                    View Thread\n                            \n                        \n\n\n\n                \t\n\t\n                                Current rating: 1.00\n                            \n\n\n\n                \n                \t\n                                \n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \t\n                                                 \n                                                    1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n\n                                                \n                                            \t    Rate \t\n                                                 \n                                                    \n                                                \n                                            \n\n\n                                \n\n                            \n\n\n                \t\n                            \t\n                                        Contributors to the forum can rank each others' comments using the rating facility. \n                                        You may award a score of between 1 and 10 (1 being the highest rating). \n                                        An average rating for the message is displayed on the messages list page.\n                                    \n\n\n                        \n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n\n            \n            \n            \t\t\t\t \n\n\n            \n        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Initial trials whilst still in the Firth of Forth were in the main successful and the Babcocks staff were boat transferred off to Berwick within a matter of hours.  There remained a problem with too many leaks from both main engines however which would not be able to be resolved until the ship was alongside in Portsmouth.\n\n\n\nDuring the passage south the Deputy Marine Engineer Officer, CPO ‘Cheesy’ Chesson, qualified as engineering Officer of the Watch, having completed his final set of machinery breakdown drills.\n\n\n\nFleet Date Inspection\n\nWe arrived back in Portsmouth on Thursday 27th May, the day before our big inspection.  With such a short time to prepare and a Base Logistics Inspection going on that same afternoon it was all hands to the pumps.  The Fleet Date Inspection was conducted by Captain David Dickens Royal Navy, Captain Surface Ships to the Commodore Portsmouth Flotilla.  It was a close call but despite the ship looking very smart we failed the Inspection due to the as yet unresolved main engine leaks.  This was disappointing but with most of the following week to effect the repair had little impact on our Programme.  The leaks were fixed and proved at sea allowing us to sail as planned on 4th June and return to the Fleet 6 days later than planned.\n\n\n\nWe are currently enroute to Faslane for Operational Sea Training but took the opportunity to stop at anchor overnight off the Isle of Man for an evening of ‘Horse Racing’ on the Flight Deck. This was an excellent event, kindly organised by the Senior Rates Mess and much enjoyed by all.  The girls syndicate, with Chef McDowell as an honorary member for the night, seemed to do particularly well although the real winner was the ship’s charity for which we raised £180.  \n\n\n\nFuture Programme\n\nLooking ahead post three weeks of Operational Sea training in Scotland we will return to Portsmouth for a Base Maintenance Period and aviation trials.  We are then very much looking forward to Re-dedication and families day before proceeding on a well earned summer leave.\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nBesides the new Buffer we also welcome Petty Officer Communications ‘Pony’ Moore who joined in Rosyth to take over from Petty Officer ‘Spike’ Hughes who left to join the Sea Training Team in Plymouth. \n\n\n\nLeading Weapon Engineer Mechanic (Radar) ‘Kenny’ Kenworthy joined as part of the Falkland Island manning alongside our new Leading Medical Assistant Dave Edwards and Leading Steward Yvonne Jordan.  OMs Allon, Barnes, Poulton and Rothwell have also recently joined us from HMS Ark Royal.\n\n\n\nIn addition Lieutenants Meredith Scanlon and Joanne Culshaw joined us from HMS Collingwood for six months of Navigation training before commencing their first complement jobs as Warfare Officers.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore pictures in the Photo Gallery\nRead More ...\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\tTop of page \n\n\t\t\tPrint \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t© Crown Copyright 2004.

The use of ASBOs had therefore increased by 50% in the last year. It was clear that the powers were starting to take grip and were being used more widely up and down the country. However, the purpose of the Prime Minister's visit to Harlow today was to encourage their use more widely. The PMOS pointed out that 422 ASBOs had been issued in Greater Manchester since 1999 - up 232% since 31 March 2003. 59 ASBOs had been issued in Liverpool - up 139%. 122 ASBOs had been issued in Leeds - up 430%. 48 ASBOs had been issued in the London Borough of Camden - up 182%. These figures showed that local councils, local authorities and the police were beginning to see how effective the powers actually were and were starting to use them more widely. \nAsked how the ASBOs were being used, the PMOS pointed to the use of Fixed Penalty Notices. He also noted that Harlow had been the first council to use dispersal orders to break up gatherings of people. The powers were clearly beginning to bite. Asked if there was a sense of frustration that some councils, such as Lambeth and Hackney, were not using the powers that were available to help combat anti-social behaviour, the PMOS said that part of the problem was the fact that some local authorities remained to be convinced of the effectiveness of the powers. The purpose of the Prime Minister's visit to Harlow today was to highlight their value as a tool to tackle anti-social behaviour. It was also why a team of 'ambassadors' and experts had been appointed to show councils what could be done. In some areas, pressure from the local community had led to the powers being used. That could only spread. Asked whose job it was to issue ASBOs, the PMOS said that they were issued by the local authorities. The areas covered included environmental crime, nuisance neighbours and supporting witnesses.\nNorthern Ireland\nAsked about the latest round of talks on Northern Ireland, the PMOS said that this week would see preliminary discussions taking place between the Secretary of State and the local parties on a bilateral basis, leading to intensive talks at Leeds Castle between 16 and 18 September. The aim was to come up with a deal. We believed that the parties had engaged seriously since the Assembly elections in preparing the ground for such a situation and that it was worth going for a deal rather than delaying the process. As anyone who had been following what people on both sides had been saying over the summer would recognise, there was a common agenda on the devolution of policing and how to handle the timescale of such issues as decommissioning and bringing paramilitarism to an end. These were now being openly discussed between the parties in a way which would have been inconceivable a few years ago. Today was the tenth anniversary of the IRA ceasefire. We had clearly come a long way since then. That said, we had yet to complete the journey. Both President Clinton and Senator Clinton had underlined during their visit to Northern Ireland last week that delay would only result in a political vacuum, which was clearly a very dangerous thing.\nAsked for a reaction Mark Durkan's concern that there was too much compromise was being made to benefit the extreme end of Northern Ireland politics at the expense of the moderates, the PMOS said he did not think it would it would be helpful to comment directly on what Mr Durkan had said. However, it was important to recognise the very clear criteria which the Prime Minister had set down in a speech in Belfast two years ago in which he had underlined that any deal would have to result in a complete end to all forms of paramilitarism and to a genuine inclusive democratic Government. That was a goal towards which the SDLP had played a very constructive role in helping to achieve. It was true that different parties would have different approaches to the talks. However, the important point was that there was a shared agenda. Asked if he would agree that the SDLP had been 'comprehensively shafted' by political forces, despite the role it had played, the PMOS said that it wasn't his job to comment on election results. As we had said at the time, electoral support and electoral responsibility went hand in hand. That principle applied to all sides. \nAsked if it remained the Prime Minister's intention to call for new elections in Northern Ireland should the talks at Leeds Castle fail, the PMOS said that it was important to be clear what the Prime Minister had actually said. He had simply been making the point that there was no reason to delay the process and that we would sit down and see if a deal could be reached. If that was not possible, then that was clearly something on which we would have to reflect. However, at the moment we were focussing all our energy and attention on achieving a deal.\nFox Hunting\nAsked how urgent the Prime Minister considered the fox hunting issue to be in terms of when it would be brought forward in Parliament, the PMOS said that he had nothing further to add to what had already been said about the issue. Asked if it would be discussed in Cabinet on Thursday, the PMOS pointed out that there was no Cabinet meeting this week. Asked the Government's latest position on the issue, the PMOS said that it had not changed. As everyone was aware, the matter had been up for discussion. When we had anything further to say about it, we would let people know.\nOlmpics/EU Flag\nAsked for a reaction to reports today suggesting that the outgoing President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, was proposing that European athletes should sport the EU flag in commemorating their sporting victories, the PMOS said that he was not aware of any plans to introduce such an idea. The Great Britain team would continue to fly the Union Jack whenever the opportunity arose. He took the opportunity to congratulate Team GB on its performance in the Olympic Games in Athens. Asked if a victory parade would be arranged for them, the PMOS said that, as with England's Rugby triumph, we would talk to the athletics authorities and decide what they wanted to do. Asked if the Prime Minister liked the idea of a victory parade, the PMOS pointed out that the Olympics had only just finished and the athletes had only just returned home. We would let them catch up on their sleep before talking to them. \nPrime Minister/Holiday\nAsked if the Prime Minister felt relaxed and 'raring to go' after his summer holiday, the PMOS said yes. Asked about a reported incident relating to a football game involving the Prime Minister and Prime Minister Berlusconi of Italy, the PMOS said that his days as a football commentator were long gone. Those who had read his match reports in the Belfast Telegraph would know why. Questioned further, the PMOS declined to comment on a game he hadn't attended. \nReshuffle\nAsked to rule out the possibility of a Cabinet reshuffle before the Party Conference season, the PMOS said that he was impressed with the remarkable restraint shown by journalists in waiting until the end of the briefing to ask about this matter. As they knew very well, however, it wasn't his policy to respond to reshuffle questions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Links\n \n Email the Prime Minister\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSend an email to Prime Minister Tony Blair\n\t\t\t\t\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrime Minister's Questions\nWatch Prime Minister's Questions live here every Wednesday Parliament is in session\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tFrequently Asked Questions\nAnswers to our most frequently asked questions\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLearn about the Cabinet\nLearn more about the Ministers who make up the Cabinet and its famous history\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUseful Links\nUseful links to other government sites\n\n \n\n\n\n\n|\n\t\t\tcopyright | contact the webteam | website feedback | privacy policy | advanced search | sitemap | accessibility | rss feed | \n\n\n\n\n",

          "SRB Round 5: regional frameworkSRB Round 5: regional framework\nContents\n\nMOST DEPRIVED WARDS IN THE EAST MIDLANDS (1998 Index of Local Deprivation)\t12\nGO-EM SRB ROUND 5 CONTACTS\t13\nSUMMARY\t29\nGOVERNMENT OFFICE FOR LONDON\t30\nANNEX A\t30\nANNEX B\t31\nANNEX 1\t56\nANNEX 2\t57\nANNEX 3\t58\n \n\nThe advice in this paper supplements the guidance given in the SRB Round 5 Bidding Guidance, and should be read alongside it. Its purpose is to inform bidders about regional needs and priorities, as the Government sees them. It also gives an indication of the level of resources likely to be available regionally to support new schemes.\n\nRegional Overview\nThe South West is the largest region in England with 18% of the country's area and 8% of its population (4.8 million). It is predominately rural in character and has an attractive natural and built environment. \n\nThe region is relatively prosperous with a diverse economic base, though it has higher than average dependency on defence industries, tourism, agriculture and financial services. While small firms predominate in the region, there are also notable large and international businesses with significant supply chains. Some of the smaller towns are traditionally associated with one major employer, many of them vulnerable to economic change.\n\nThe region has a strong higher and further education sector. There is a broad skills base, though there are skills shortages in the faster growing areas and problems for the low skilled in obtaining employment. Unemployment is unevenly distributed, with significant clusters in disadvantaged areas of Bristol and Plymouth and structural unemployment in Cornwall. Market towns face a changing role as a more mobile population finds jobs and facilities elsewhere.\n\nThe main problems of social exclusion in the South West are related to:\n\nunderachievement and low skill, particularly amongst youth \n\nlack of employment opportunities, and access to facilities and training, especially in Cornwall and rural areas \n\nparticular issues of drug abuse, criminality and homelessness \n\nethnic minorities\n\nResources\nThe indicative total allocation for new schemes under Round 5 in this region is: \n\n\tyear 1 1999/2000\n\teach subsequent year\n\n\t£2-4 million\n\t£5-8 million\n\n\nPriority Areas\nMinisters have indicated that they wish to see 80% of SRB Round 5 resources targetted towards comprehensive schemes in those local authority district areas which are included in the top 50 on one or more of the four measures of deprivation shown in Annex C of the Bidding Guidance. This means that most of the available resources nationally will be allocated to a small number of regeneration schemes in those specific priority areas. In the South West, there are two urban areas in this category - Bristol and Plymouth.\n\nThe remainder of the regional allocation will be available for other areas or disadvantaged groups which have significant need. We would particularly welcome local area proposals from Penwith, Kerrier and Torbay (which fall within the 100 most deprived districts in the country on the district-wide degree measure). Rural Development Areas and other areas which can demonstrate significant pockets of deprivation that have not yet benefitted from SRB support may also be candidates for funding. In addition, wider area, or thematic, bids will be considered provided they can demonstrate that they would make a material impact on a clearly defined disadvantaged group, particularly those identified in the work of the national Social Exclusion Unit.\n\n Scheme content\nOutside Bristol and Plymouth, schemes should generally be seeking less than £2m by way of total SRB contribution. All schemes should clearly address social exclusion and seek to enhance opportunities for those at greatest disadvantage. Local area schemes should offer sustainable community based responses to local need. They should demonstrate clear linkages with other regeneration activity and the active involvement of local residents in both the preparation and implementation of the proposals. All the bids should be supported by the relevant public agencies and private and voluntary sector interests. All bids must show that effective local management systems will be put in place and that projects will be rigorously appraised. Wider area or thematic bids are most likely to be successful where they create new ways of working among existing agencies to provide a more cohesive approach to combatting disadvantage.\n\nLinkages with other Government, and publicly funded, programmes and initiatives (including regeneration initiatives) should be clearly demonstrated in all bids. Schemes that include employment measures should explicitly state how they link in to New Deal. Proposals that include employment, training and education projects should indicate how they relate to the relevant TEC, Careers Company and Local Education Authority plan and programme. In the case of Plymouth, clear links to Health, Employment and Education Action Zone initiatives should be demonstrated.\n\nIn drawing up bids, partnerships should reflect opportunities for funding from the European Union for their schemes. ESF Objective 3 (support for the long term unemployed and disadvantaged) and ESF Objective 4 for employees 'at risk' are cross regional. Additionally, in this region, Cornwall, much of Devon and parts of West Somerset have Objective 5b status; Plymouth has Objective 2. Much of the region is also eligible for funding under specific European programmes such KONVER, LEADER and PESCA. Further details of these programmes can be obtained on request from Government Office for the South West.\n\nCommunity Initiatives\nMinisters are keen to encourage the active participation of local communities in their areas. As explained in the national Bidding Guidance, up to 10% of the resources made available for each scheme may be used to support capacity building activity1. There is also provision for free standing schemes devoted to capacity building, provided that they lead to a sustainable regeneration plan. In considering such bids in this region, priority will be given to the most needy communities where there is the clear prospect of developing active involvement and ownership. \n\nBids for community enterprise and investment schemes (see national Guidance) should demonstrate that they meet a genuine gap in the availability of capital funding and are based in an active but needy community. The SRB contribution will be limited to 50% and to £50,000 per scheme. \n\nRegional Development Agency\nSubject to legislation, control of the SRB will pass from the Government Office to the South West Regional Development Agency (RDA) during the course of this bidding round. On 29 July, it was announced in Parliament that the Chairman designate of this Agency is Sir Michael Lickiss. Other Board members and the Chief Executive will be identified in the next few months, and the RDA will begin operation in April 1999. Prior to April 1999, the SRB will continue to be administered by the SRB Team of the Government Office for the South West (see contact details below), involving the RDA Board designate as appropriate. We will aim to ensure a smooth transition. Details of the new arrangements will be supplied before the final bid stage.\n\nBidding Process\nThe national Bidding Guidance indicates that expressions of interest must be submitted to the Government Office by Friday 27 November 1998, but potential bidders should get in touch with the Government Office as early as possible to discuss their proposals informally.

It supplements the national Bidding Guidance and should be read alongside it.\n\n2.     Resources for Round 5 schemes in the Region are approximately £1-2m in 1999/2000, and £3-5m in each of the further 6 years for which schemes may run. Against that background we are likely to be able to support only 5 or 6 new schemes at most (not including any bids to top up existing schemes). This note indicates the areas from which bids are likely to be sympathetically considered, bearing in mind that the aim of the SRB is to assist in regenerating areas suffering from social, economic and environmental deprivation.\n\n3.     Eastern Region is large and diverse, incorporating London commuter suburbs, free-standing towns, ports and seaside resorts, and extensive rural areas. There are no major conurbations, Southend, Luton/Dunstable, Norwich and Peterborough being the largest urban areas.\n\n4.     Most of the region is fairly prosperous. In the 1980s East Anglia, especially Cambridgeshire, was the fastest-growing part of the UK, and growth resumed as the recession ended. County unemployment rates are all now below the UK average. The Cambridge area and much of Hertfordshire are especially buoyant. Felixstowe is the fastest growing major port in the UK. Peterborough retains high growth potential, and Stansted Airport will increasingly be a focus for growth. Much of the region, especially the southern and western parts, has high quality road and rail connections, and the southern parts benefit from the strength of the London economy.\n\n5.     There are however areas of deprivation. Many of these areas suffer from multiple problems, including unemployment, low educational attainment, high crime, poor health, homelessness and bad housing, pollution and environmental degradation, and inadequate infrastructure. They include substantial parts of:\n\nLuton/Dunstable, with a narrow industrial base hit by vehicle manufacturing closures in the early 1990s, now again under threat from the possible loss of manufacturing capacity, and severely affected by the housing market downturn of 1989-93; there is a large and disadvantaged ethnic minority community;\n\nNorwich: major sub-regional centre, but relatively isolated, with a low-wage economy, and suffering from recent job losses in confectionery and other industries, and with a substantial need to invest in renovating its council housing stock;\n\nSouthend: affected by the long-term decline of domestic seaside holidays, with a low-wage economy and poor private housing with extensive multiple occupation;\n\nother port/fishing/seaside resort towns, including Harwich (with the region's highest unemployment rate), Wisbech, King's Lynn, Great Yarmouth, Lowestoft, Clacton, Grays and Tilbury - all suffering from decline of their former economic base, with high unemployment and low wage rates, and many poorly served by road and rail;\n\ninner areas of older industrial towns, including Bedford, Ipswich, Peterborough and Watford, characterised by loss of local employment, poor environment and run-down private housing, some with deprived ethnic minority communities;\n\nsome former New Towns, including Harlow, Basildon and Stevenage, and former GLC/LCC overspill estates, with ageing infrastructure, low educational attainment, high levels of benefit dependency and high crime rates.\n\n6.     Though less apparent from employment statistics, there are also weaknesses in the structure of the local economy in some of the more remote rural areas, where communications are poor, there is little local economic activity other than farming, and CAP reforms may cause further job losses.\n\n7.     The above analysis is largely confirmed by DETR's Index of Local Deprivation, which updated and revised the Index of Local Conditions, and is used in allocating resources for the SRB between regions. Six districts (Norwich, Luton, Great Yarmouth, Harlow, Ipswich and Thurrock) fall within the 100 most deprived districts in the country on the district-wide 'degree' measure, which measures deprivation averaged across the district using 12 indicators, many of them updated as part of the 1998 revision. Small area statistics (still mainly based on the 1991 Census) also reveal pockets of severe deprivation elsewhere, notably in Peterborough, Bedford, Waveney (Lowestoft ), Kings Lynn, Southend and Tendring (Clacton and Harwich). The table attached at Annex A shows the national ranking of the districts in the region on the four measures used in the ILD.\n\n8.     Paragraph 3.1 of the national Bidding Guidance indicates that about 80% of SRB resources at national level will go to support large schemes in those districts that rank in the top 50 on one or more of the four ILD measures (65 districts in all). There is only one such district in Eastern Region: Luton, ranked 45 on the ED-level extent measure (% of EDs in the worst 7% nationally). Proposals for a major scheme from Luton will be welcome, subject to the same quality criteria as for other bids. We shall however bear in mind in assessing competing bids that several other districts in the region rank above or close to Luton on the other ILD measures.\n\n9.     Wisbech, Great Yarmouth, Harwich, and Clacton Travel-to-Work Areas have Assisted Area status, entitling businesses to apply for Regional Selective Assistance. Current areas are eligible for RSA until 1999 and the review has commenced of areas for new designations. Parts of rural Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and Essex are designated as Rural Development Areas. In 1994 Lowestoft (because of the decline of the fishing industry), and three rural areas (the Fens, central rural Norfolk, and rural east Suffolk), were awarded EU Objective 5b status, entitling them to ,46m of extra resources over 5 years. EU KONVER II funding is available to areas affected by defence industry closures in Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, Essex and Suffolk and PESCA funding in King's Lynn, Southend and Lowestoft in response to the decline of the fishing industry. Current EU designations expire in 2000.\n\n10.     Other recent area-based initiatives that will benefit parts of the region include:\n\nBasildon and Thetford being designated as Education Action Zones to provide test-beds for innovative ideas to raise education standards in disadvantaged areas;\n\nLuton's designation as a Health Action Zone to address health inequalities and promote inter-agency working to improve public health;\n\nLuton/Dunstable Partnership, Peterborough, and Suffolk County Council being selected as pathfinders by the Local Government Association under their New Commitment to Regeneration, which will develop regeneration strategies locally to harness central and local government resources and those of other public agencies and explore how systems could be changed to facilitate effective regeneration.\n\n11.     An announcement is expected to be made shortly about the New Deal for Communities, designed to support intensive regeneration schemes in the most deprived small areas (no more than 4000 households). It is expected that a district within this region will be invited to submit proposals for a pathfinder scheme. GOER will advise where necessary on the relationship between SRB and NDC.\n\n12.     SRB schemes approved in Rounds 1-4 bidding rounds have benefited almost all of the disadvantaged areas listed in paragraph 5. They have also contributed to addressing pockets of deprivation elsewhere, and to enhancing skills, helping young offenders and promoting enterprise across larger areas.\n\n13.     The guidance for Round 4 made clear that need was a primary criterion in assessing bids. This shift of emphasis will be maintained in Round 5. Within the region, we hope to see strong bids coming forward from those deprived areas, both urban and rural, which did not succeed or secured only small allocations in earlier rounds (including parts of towns where earlier schemes have had a small-area focus). Bidders may also make a case to reinforce the benefits of schemes already receiving support, especially in larger towns where major regeneration investment is required. Bids not justified in terms of need will not be approved. Any wide-area bids will need to demonstrate very clearly that they would make a material impact on an identifiable deprived group of people.\n\n14.     As in previous rounds, a wide variety of activities may qualify for support, as set out in the national Bidding Guidance, which also sets out some further changes of emphasis in the Government's priorities. Experience indicates that the best schemes are those that have a clear geographical focus, are based on thorough research and consultation on the needs of the area, and are submitted by a broad-based partnership involving local authority, private and community sectors. Many of the best schemes deliver a broad range of outputs, designed, in conjunction with main programme expenditure, to address the needs of an area as a whole. Single-purpose bids may, exceptionally, be supported provided they are set in the context of a regeneration strategy for the area. Bidders could still do more to involve businesses, educational establishments, and voluntary and community organisations as full partners. The genuine and effective commitment of partnerships to involving the local community at an early stage and to community capacity-building will, for most types of scheme, be a requisite for approval. Around £50k will be available in the region specifically for pilot community enterprise and investment schemes, especially those which promote an innovative approach to access to capital.\n\n15.     Where bids include physical development, especially of derelict land, bidders should consult English Partnerships. Bids in rural areas, especially Rural Development Areas, should be discussed with the Rural Development Commission. Other relevant statutory agencies, eg Health Authorities and police forces, should normally be involved in the development of schemes.\n\n16.     The Regional Advisory Panel set up to advise GOER on bids in round 4 will continue for round 5. A list of the members is at Annex B. GOER will also consult the shadow Regional Development Agency, which will take on formal responsibility for the SRB from 1 April 1999 and will then advise Ministers on the approval of final bids.\n\n17.     Prospective bidders should make early contact with GOER: bids which have not been the subject of informal discussion ahead of the deadline for submission of expressions of interest are much less likely to succeed. Officials will be pleased to offer advice on developing their proposals to potential bidders from areas identified above as priorities for SRB support. Enquiries should be addressed to Keith Allen, head of the SRB team (01234-796135).\n\n Background Following the Regeneration Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR), DETR Ministers have announced that local regeneration partnerships in the areas of greatest need can submit proposals for additional resources through SRB Round 5. These proposals should be prepared in response to the national guidance and this regional regeneration framework, and in discussion with the Government Office (GO-EM).\n\nSRB Round 5 proposals should address social exclusion and enhance opportunities for those at a disadvantage in the areas of greatest need. They should add value to existing partnership activity in these deprived areas, through the development of sustainable, community-based responses to local need and the more effective targeting of existing and proposed programmes and services. The proposals should demonstrate clear linkages with other regeneration activity. Local partnerships will be expected to demonstrate the active involvement of relevant public agencies, private and voluntary sector interests and local residents in the preparation and proposed implementation of their proposals. They will also need to ensure that effective local management systems will be in place and that projects will be rigorously appraised.\n\nRegional allocations for new schemes will depend on the level of existing commitments. Present indications are that up to £4m in 1999/2000 and up to £9m in each of the following 6 years will be available for new schemes in the East Midlands.\n\nRegional Priority Areas Ministers have indicated that they wish to see SRB Round 5 resources targeted towards large, comprehensive schemes in the most deprived districts nationally (according to the Index of Local Deprivation). They have also signalled their strong commitment to tackling need in the former coalfield areas and other \"pockets of deprivation\".\n\nIn the East Midlands, this will be reflected in twin priorities:\n\ni.   Proposals from Nottingham, Leicester, Lincoln and Derby, which are the most deprived local authority areas of the region, according to the national Index. About half of the regional allocation will be available for good quality comprehensive proposals to address deprivation and social exclusion in these districts. As indicated in the national guidance, these comprehensive schemes should be based on an agreed local strategy with commitments secured from local partners. Where appropriate, local partnerships might wish to use proposals developed in response to the LGA's New Commitment for Regeneration as a starting point for developing their local regeneration strategy.\n\nii.   Tackling the needs of the most deprived parts of the former North Nottinghamshire/Derbyshire coalfield (within the districts of Mansfield, Bolsover, Chesterfield, Ashfield, Bassetlaw, North East Derbyshire and Newark & Sherwood). Local partnerships are encouraged to develop an integrated response to the issues raised in the recent Coalfield Task Force report.\n\nThe remainder of the regional allocation will be available for good quality local schemes of generally less than £2m, including:\n\na.   smaller scale community initiatives in the above regional priority areas. In particular, SRB funding of up to £50,000 will be available as match funding for innovative community enterprise and investment schemes.\n\nb.   the regeneration of particularly deprived neighbourhoods in otherwise relatively prosperous districts. For this purpose, priority will be given to proposals which address the needs of those wards of Northampton, East Lindsey and Erewash, which are among the 10% most deprived nationally. A list of relevant wards is attached.\n\nc.   innovative responses to significant rural deprivation within the region's Rural Development Areas as defined by the Rural Development Commission.\n\nMany parts of the East Midlands are benefiting from schemes funded under previous SRB rounds, including those areas identified above. In determining which schemes to support under SRB Round 5, account will be taken of these existing schemes and the effectiveness of the partnerships responsible for their implementation. Local partnerships might wish to take advantage of SRB Round 5 to consolidate existing SRB activity within the context of a single agreed local regeneration strategy. \n\nPriority Themes As indicated above, Ministers expect future SRB schemes to address social exclusion and enhance opportunities for those at a disadvantage. Local partnerships are best placed to determine how to meet local needs most effectively. However, activity proposed under the SRB should particularly target the most vulnerable groups, including young people and, where relevant, ethnic minorities.\n\nIn addition, SRB schemes could address competitiveness and innovation in the local economy. Local partnerships should look to take advantage of inward investment activity undertaken by EMDC and English Partnerships. However most new jobs will arise from the growth of local businesses, particularly SMEs, and SRB resources could be used to add value to local TEC and Business Link activity.\n\nActivity proposed under the SRB should increase the capacity of local partnerships and communities to tackle their needs. Proposals should aim to be self-sustaining after the initial period of funding. \n\nIntegration SRB proposals should be developed within wider local regeneration strategies. These strategies should show how the proposed SRB activity would add value to: \n\na.   mainstream public sector programmes and services, especially those delivered by local authorities and the TECs, \n\nb.   Government initiatives, especially Welfare to Work, but also, where relevant, Employment, and Health and Education Action Zones, and the New Deal for Communities Pathfinders\n\nc.   the regional and local strategies of agencies, such as English Partnerships and the Rural Development Commission\n\nProposals should also be consistent with policies set out in the Regional Planning Guidance for the East Midlands (RPG8), the Regional Competitiveness Strategy and the region's Single Programme Documents.\n\nLiaison with GO-EM Local partnerships will need to work closely with GO-EM in the preparation of their bids. In particular, partnerships in the regional priority areas should involve GO-EM in the development of the local regeneration strategies and the proposed comprehensive schemes. Partnerships looking to access European funding to support their SRB bid should first contact the European Secretariat within GO-EM to discuss the likely availability of resources. A list of contacts is attached.\n\nSubject to the necessary legislation, responsibility for SRB will transfer to the East Midlands RDA on 1 April 1999. Outline SRB Round 5 proposals will be assessed by GO-EM in consultation with the RDA Shadow Board. Final bids will be appraised by the RDA, with decisions taken by Ministers. Details of the proposed hand-over arrangements will be provided later.\n\nMOST DEPRIVED WARDS IN THE EAST MIDLANDS (1998 Index of Local Deprivation)\n\n\tNorth Braunstone\n\tLeicester\n\n\tRadford\n\tNottingham\n\n\tWycliffe\n\tLeicester\n\n\tBabington\n\tDerby\n\n\tForest\n\tNottingham\n\n\tLenton\n\tNottingham\n\n\tSaffron\n\tLeicester\n\n\tStrelley\n\tNottingham\n\n\tLitchurch\n\tDerby \n\n\tOsmaston\n\tDerby\n\n\tSt Ann's\n\tNottingham\n\n\tWest Humberstone\n\tLeicester\n\n\tTrent\n\tNottingham\n\n\tManvers\n\tNottingham\n\n\tAspley\n\tNottingham\n\n\tDerwent\n\tDerby \n\n\tBridge\n\tNottingham\n\n\tSt Crispin\n\tNorthampton\n\n\tCharnwood\n\tLeicester\n\n\tSpinney Hill\n\tLeicester\n\n\tBelgrave\n\tLeicester\n\n\tScarborough\n\tEast Lindsey\n\n\tWorksop South East\n\tBassetlaw\n\n\tBeaumont Leys\n\tLeicester\n\n\tEyres Monsell\n\tLeicester\n\n\tDallington and Kings Heath\n\tNorthampton\n\n\tIlkeston North\n\tErewash\n\n\tFA Abbey\n\tDerby \n\n\tPark\n\tLincoln\n\n\tEarlesfield\n\tSouth Kesteven\n\n\tBulwell West\n\tNottingham\n\n\tAbbey\n\tLincoln\n\n\tMablethorpe\n\tEast Lindsey\n\n\tGainsborough East\n\tWest Lindsey\n\n\tKingswood\n\tCorby\n\n\tRowley Fields\n\tLeicester\n\n\tCastle\n\tNorthampton\n\n\tNormanton\n\tDerby\n\n\tByron\n\tNottingham\n\n\tHarworth East\n\tBassetlaw\n\n\tMowmacre\n\tLeicester\n\n\tMiddlecroft\n\tChesterfield\n\n\tLatimer\n\tLeicester\n\n\tNew Parks\n\tLeicester\n\n\tNorthfield\n\tMansfield\n\n\tGamesley\n\tHigh Peak\n\n\nGO-EM SRB ROUND 5 CONTACTS\n\n\tMalcolm Healey (0115) 971 2447\n\tGreater Nottingham Northamptonshire \n\n\tJohn Perkins (0115) 971 2443\n\tLincolnshire Leicester \n\n\tPam Hough (0115) 971 2444\n\tNorth Nottinghamshire/Derbyshire\n\n\tJane Barratt (0115) 971 2454\n\tDerby South and west Derbyshire Rural Leicestershire\n\n\n\n Introduction\nThe purpose of this guidance is to provide a regional assessment framework within which SRB Round 5 bids in the North-East will be considered. It gives an indication of the resources that will be available to support schemes, an analysis of the target areas for different elements of the budget and also highlights the key regeneration needs and themes that should be addressed.\n\nThe objectives of the SRB programme are to: \n\nenhance the employment prospects, education and skills of local people;\n\naddress social exclusion and enhance opportunities for the disadvantaged through community development;\n\npromote sustainable regeneration, improving and protecting the environment and infrastructure;\n\nimprove the quality of life of local people and their capacity to participate in regeneration activities;\n\nencourage more effective integration of programmes through partnerships and the involvement of local communities and voluntary groups;\n\nsupport and promote growth in local economies and businesses.\n\nResources\nIndicative SRB resources available for new Round 5 Schemes in the North-East are :\n\n\t1999/2000\n\taround £10m\n\n\t2000/2001\n\taround £20m\n\n\t2001/2002\n\taround £20m\n\n\nThis round provides more than twice the resources available in Round 4.\n\nThe total new resources over the three years amount to around £100 million. The resources shown above for Round 5 would thus leave sufficient headroom in the programme for further SRB rounds starting in 2000 and 2001. It is too early to say how much will be available beyond 2002 but the working assumption is that most expenditure on large schemes would take place over 5 years and consequently that support for projects agreed under SRB Round 5 will be available (but at a lower level) in years 4 and 5 (i.e. beyond 2002).\n\nThe national guidance (para 9.1) refers to over 50 schemes worth £20-25m in SRB funding that can be supported in the lifetime of this Parliament. This includes expenditure on schemes started in earlier SRB rounds where Round 5 resources provide some additional support. The North East budget is likely to be able to support one or two completely new schemes of this size, with on-going schemes attracting top-up funds for expansion of existing projects that show promise.\n\nTarget Areas\nThe national guidance makes clear that a high percentage of SRB resources nationally will go to support large, comprehensive regeneration schemes in those areas which are included in the top 50 on one or more of the measures of deprivation in the Index of Local Deprivation (ILD) (see footnote1). In the North East, the following local authorities meet this criterion:\n\n\tGateshead Hartlepool Middlesbrough Newcastle upon Tyne Redcar and Cleveland South Tyneside Stockton-on-Tees Sunderland\n\n\nIt is anticipated that around half of the resources available under Round 5 will be targeted on these areas.\n\nGiven the resources available, and the emphasis on large comprehensive schemes, it is unlikely that resources will be allocated to more than one scheme in any local authority area.\n\nA significant level of resources will be available for those areas which, while not demonstrating the concentration of deprivation exhibited in those authorities in the top 50 on the ILD, nevertheless have significant pockets of need or are facing particular problems. Bids are invited particularly from those communities highlighted in the recent Coalfields Task Force report and those areas where major industrial closures have been announced in recent weeks.\n\nThe remainder of the regional allocation will be available for good quality local schemes which are generally more focused, covering a smaller area and calling on a lower level of resources. Bids are particularly invited which address priority needs and opportunities within rural areas. Annex D to the national guidance sets out the criteria for bids in rural areas and lists the Rural Development Areas where bids are encouraged. Schemes which demonstrate a well-developed partnership approach to economic and social regeneration are likely to have a greater chance of success.\n\nAlthough the main emphasis for SRB support will be on key target areas, there will still be scope to consider well directed thematic bids which cover a much wider area.\n\n1. The four different measures used are:\nthe degree of deprivation - the overall district level score.\nthe intensity of deprivation - the average score of the worst three wards in the \n\nthe ward level extent - proportion of LA population living in wards that are within the 10% most deprived.\nthe ED level extent - proportion of EDs in the LA that fall within the most deprived 7% of EDs.\n Priority Themes\nThe SRB provides resources to support regeneration initiatives carried out by local partnerships. 'Regeneration' embraces both physical regeneration projects and those aimed at promoting economic development and industrial competitiveness. It is a pre-requisite of SRB that schemes should make a real and sustained difference in deprived areas.\n\nIn the North East, we will be looking for bids that meet the objectives of the SRB programme set out at the beginning of this guidance and particularly those that aim to promote sustained economic regeneration in the region and tackle the problems of social exclusion.\n\nThe national guidance (Section 4) stresses the importance of linking SRB proposals with other Government programmes and initiatives. SRB proposals which draw more effective contributions from mainstream programmes (i.e. 'bending') into the area will get higher priority than proposals which simply supplement existing measures such as New Deal and mainstream local authority activity. Equally, social measures (such as programmes dealing with health, housing or crime) will be given higher priority where they are integrated with economic measures which seek to overcome underlying social problems.\n\nCompetitiveness\nRegional partners recently produced a competitiveness strategy for the North East - Competing in the 21st Century - which will make a key contribution to the regional economic strategy of the RDA. In developing schemes, partners should ensure that, wherever appropriate, their objectives are consistent with this strategy, particularly in relation to supporting North East business and raising educational aspirations and skill levels. Proposals for area-based business support should involve collaboration with the relevant Business Link and should be aimed at the growth of established firms.\n\nComplementarity\nOver the last 12 months there have been a number of government initiatives (e.g. Employment Zones, Health Action Zones, Surestart, Education Action Zones) aimed at co-ordinating the delivery of a wide range of programmes and policies on the ground. Where SRB proposals are looking at similar areas and target groups, there should be a clear read-across with these new initiatives to ensure added value.\n\nSRB schemes should also ensure that they are consistent with central and local government strategic policies and plans, particularly in the areas of sustainable development and regional/local planning guidance.\n\nCommunity Involvement\nWe recognise that all SRB schemes should be developed through a bottom-up approach with local partners and communities agreeing to tackle issues of local concern in a co-ordinated and effective fashion. Indeed the effective commitment of partnerships to community capacity building (especially at the outset) is a criterion for SRB support and Ministers would like to see a significant proportion of funding going to such projects. In encouraging community economic development, community-based enterprise schemes will be given priority. Business start-ups will be considered for SRB support where they are part of wider measures for community enterprise development. Access to finance for community businesses will be encouraged through support of credit unions, where possible in collaboration with other financial institutions.\n\nIt is expected that partnerships will demonstrate a clear willingness to share best practice in this and other related SRB areas of activity, including attendance at relevant seminars and conferences.\n\nDeveloping Proposals\nExpressions of interest must be submitted to GO-NE by the end of November 1998. Last year we encouraged partnerships to discuss their proposals with the Government Office and to continue the dialogue up to the point at which the final bid was submitted. We want to build on this process this year. It is essential that partnerships develop their schemes through an interactive process in order to meet identified needs in priority areas. Schemes should be developed in close dialogue with the Government Office for the North East and the other partners who will form the North East Development Agency from next April. Where appropriate, schemes should demonstrate a clear link with the findings of the Coalfields Task Force and the groups established to co-ordinate the response to major closures.\n\nFull bids are not required until the end of April 1999. They will be assessed and approved by the Regional Development Agency. Further advice will be available nearer the time.\n\n This note is one of a series being produced by each Government Office for prospective bidders under SRB Round 5 in their Region. It supplements the national Bidding Guidance and should be read alongside it. It gives an indication of the resources likely to be available, highlights some key points about the bidding process, and describes the overall approach to regeneration and the key areas and issues which we are looking at SRB Round 5 resources to tackle in London. This Framework has been discussed with members of the London Development Partnership and agreed by the LDP's Board.\n\nRESOURCES\nIn London, subject to commitments from existing Challenge Fund schemes and other SRB programmes, the assumption is that the resources available for distribution in Round 5 of the SRB will be approximately £19-22m in 1999/2000 and £44-48m in 2000/01 and each subsequent year that schemes may run. (Individual schemes may run from one to seven years. The bulk of the expenditure on major, comprehensive regeneration schemes will be expected to take place within five years. However, capacity building at the neighbourhood level and the creation of effective routeways to broader opportunities is not a quick process, so a full seven years expenditure on such elements will be expected.) \n\nWe are seeking, within the lifetime of this Parliament, to support major comprehensive regeneration schemes in the most deprived boroughs as identified in the national Bidding Guidance and reproduced at Annex A. In Round 5 we believe there is scope for the Government Office to support a small number (perhaps 6 or 8) of major comprehensive regeneration bids of around £20-25m from the boroughs listed. In addition, we shall be looking to support a number of smaller bids which will consolidate existing regeneration activity in these boroughs.\n\nOutside the most deprived boroughs in Annex A, we shall be looking to support a small number of modest bids that will tackle need in identifiable pockets of severe deprivation. Also, whilst it is expected that the majority of bids in this Round will be area based, there is scope for thematic bids which address single themes where there may otherwise be gaps in provision regionally or sub-regionally. All such bids should however relate to one or more of the priority issues set out in this framework and should take into account the need to concentrate resources on combating deprivation and social exclusion.\n\nCommunity based initiatives such as credit unions, development trusts and Local Exchange and Trading Systems (LETS) have been a feature of regeneration activities over a number of years. The Government also wants to support the growing movement towards innovative community enterprise and investment schemes, including those which encourage innovative approaches to access to capital. There is scope within London's allocation for providing up to around £500,000 for such schemes on a match funding basis, but potential bidders should note that this sum is not ringfenced. The SRB contribution will be limited to no more than £50,000 per scheme.\n\nSuccessful bids, unless they are by established partnerships and build on existing initiatives, are likely to have only modest project costs in Year 1, reflecting the requirement to provide support to ensure the active involvement of the community and the need for partnerships to have established management systems in place prior to the release of SRB funding. Bids from established partnerships will be expected to have significant levels of spend in Year 1, commensurate with the profile of available resources discussed above.\n\nBids that do not represent broadly based partnerships directly involving local communities and comprehensive approaches to the priority needs set out in the guidance are unlikely to be favoured for the SRB resources available.\n\nA key issue in assessing bids will be the extent, quality and importance of the outcomes that are planned and the significance of the impact the bid would have on the problems it identifies.\n\nPROCESS\nIt is important that anyone proposing to work up a bid to submit to GOL in Round 5 should discuss initial proposals with the Government Office as soon as possible and prior to submitting initial outline proposals to meet the 27 November deadline. Bids which have not been the subject of informal discussion ahead of the deadline are much less likely to succeed. A list of the appropriate GOL contacts, who will be pleased to offer advice on developing proposals, is at Annex B.\n\nSubmitted proposals will be assessed, both against the criteria in the Bidding Guidance and the priorities in this Framework, by officials in GOL and by members of the London Development Partnership. Final decisions will be made by Ministers.\n\nOVERALL APPROACH TO REGENERATION\nPartnership development and management will be particularly important in any evolving regional strategy. The emphasis remains on the structured development of real partnerships representing the key sectors involved, public, private, voluntary and community. Partnerships will increasingly need to develop consultative structures with those that regeneration objectives seek to touch and serve, and to respond to community needs and aspirations rather than dictate top-down solutions. Bids will normally be expected to contain proposals to support community capacity building. Bidders will be expected to check and demonstrate the sustainability of their proposals.\n\nThe complexity of regeneration in London is not a prescription for endless proliferation of partnerships. Careful thought will need to be given as to whether new regeneration initiatives could add value within existing partnership structures. There is an equally strong case for developing linkages between partnerships to establish better integration of local economic, environmental and community regeneration agendas.\n\nTo assist in working towards a more effective integrated approach, it will be particularly important for partnerships to ensure that they recognise and address the complexity of funding programmes (available from both the Government and Europe), linking up with existing and planned area based initiatives. Resources targeted through initiatives such as Education Action Zones, Health Action Zones and the New Deal for Communities pilots will require integration and coordination with any proposed new SRB programmes. Partnerships will also need to consider linkages with European funding from the Structural Funds through Objective 2 and Community Initiatives in the London region and through Objectives 3 and 4 of the European Social Fund.\n\nA central theme to bids should be the concept of an integrated approach to sustainable development1, as developed by London partners in the work of the London Study. Such an approach would highlight the need to address sustainable development in three respects: economic competitiveness, social cohesion and environmental sustainability. Bids should adopt an integrated approach to sustainable development that identifies the potential impact of activities on all three key areas. In taking an integrated approach to sustainable development, while bids may focus on only one or two of the key components, they should identify potential impacts on the other key aspects.\n\n1. sustainable development is defined in the London Study as \"A development that offers fundamental, social and economic services to all the residents of a community without compromising the proper functioning of the natural settlement and social system on which the supply of these services depends\"\n PRIORITY ISSUES FOR SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY REGENERATION\nLondon's most deprived communities are in a particularly acute position: they are affected by global/regional competitiveness issues, often experience poor environmental conditions and have not been effectively engaged in the regeneration process. In this context, multiple deprivation undermines the viability of such communities, creates poor quality of life and impedes their ability to create their own opportunities or engage effectively with broader opportunities.\n\nA focus on communities is a key element of Government regeneration policy. There is a recognised need to encourage a bottom-up approach to regeneration rather than imposing priorities from above. It is important that partnerships should support and develop structures which operate on a scale individuals can identify with. As part of this process, community enablement is an important factor in an on-going programme of sustained regeneration.\n\nArea regeneration programmes should develop coordinated packages to address the specific needs of priority communities. Such programmes may include a range of initiatives. A primary focus will be to address community enablement, capacity building and widening participation in education, and to demonstrate mechanisms by which this can be brought about. In addition, a number of key priorities should be addressed:\n\nPopulation Diversity It is important to develop programmes to take on board the needs of the whole community, including those of women, young people, older people, disabled people and a broad range of ethnic minority groups:\n\nLondon is home to 45% of Britain's ethnic minorities and 1 in 5 Londoners come from an ethnic minority group, higher than any other region; \n\nWomen make up over half of London's population, and the percentage of younger women in the population is greater than elsewhere in the UK;\n\nEstimates of disabled people will vary with the definition used: 12% of London households are in receipt of incapacity or disablement benefits, with identical percentages in inner and outer London, but around a fifth of the population report suffering from a limiting long-standing illness, with the highest rates recorded in inner London boroughs; \n\nLondon's population is generally younger than the rest of the country, and young people continue to be a primary consideration in regeneration policy;\n\nOlder people, although conversely fewer than elsewhere in the country (15.5% are at retirement age compared to 18.2%), often have particular needs, e.g. around community safety or employment.\n\nWe will be looking in Round 5 for schemes which will help these groups share more in the prosperity of the region. Bids which clearly demonstrate the involvement of these communities of people as committed partners in the planning and delivery of schemes will be particularly welcomed.\n\nEducation, Skills and Lifelong Learning. Learning is the key to prosperity and the aims of the SRB reflect this. Pre-school care is a primary consideration and quality provision for those in greatest need can add an important element to local community regeneration programmes.\n\nIn terms of educational performance London has some of the best and some of the worst schools in the country. At GCSE only eight boroughs exceeded the English average of 44.5% pupils achieving 5+ passes at grades A-C. GOL will be looking for bids which seek to raise educational attainment, increase the diversity and flexibility of learning opportunities for young people, and enable them to pursue the qualifications they need. It will be important to address disaffection and exclusion to achieve local community regeneration. It will be important in addition to address the educational need of some pupils from ethnic minority backgrounds or with special educational needs. SRB 5 may bring opportunities for complementary programmes in London's four Education Action Zones.\n\nTraining for skills and lifelong learning opportunities remain a priority beyond compulsory schooling. Although London has performed better in working towards the national Targets for Education and Training than other parts of the country, there is still much progress to be made. Skills and lifelong learning proposals in SRB5 should in particular address skills gaps and lifelong learning opportunities and complement developments flowing from the Government's Green Paper. \"The Learning Age\", including those being funded from sources such as the FE Collaboration Fund, ADAPT and Objective 4 of the European Social Fund.\n\nVoluntary Sector The voluntary sector has been increasingly involved in the SRB and other regeneration programmes. There are an estimated 30,000 organisations employing about 50,000 staff in the capital. The figure increases to 60,000 plus if organisations operating within communities, often with unpaid staff, are included. This is a valuable resource and we shall be looking for bidding partnerships, particularly funding agencies in the public sector, to demonstrate in Round 5 that they are working more closely with and actively supporting local voluntary and community organisations, ethnic minority and faith communities.\n\nUnemployment Unemployment is an acute problem in many of London's most deprived communities. Levels of unemployment in London remain high with over 315,000 unemployed, with some 196,000 having been out of work for more than six months. Of that total, some 68,000 are aged 18-24 (34,000 for 6 months+). Round 5 bidders should consider carefully how their proposals will meet the Government's Welfare to Work priorities, consulting those involved in the delivery of New Deal programmes as appropriate, and address the needs of the target groups.\nGrowth of local economies Business has a key role in regeneration. In the longer term, lasting regeneration of communities can only take place through competitive businesses in an area contributing to the growth of a local economy. Schemes which promote opportunities for, and reflect the needs of, business leading to sustainable economic development are, therefore, of considerable value. Proposals, where appropriate, should take into account local Business Links strategies. Such schemes need not be confined to the most deprived districts as defined in the national Bidding Guidance as these districts can also take advantage from schemes in surrounding areas which encourage wealth creation. \n\nCommunity Safety Crime and fear of crime are near the top of most Londoners' concerns. The Crime and Disorder Act places a new duty jointly upon local authorities and the police, with others, to develop strategies to reduce crime; the Government has also taken special measures through the appointment of a UK Anti-drugs Coordinator, to better focus action against drugs misuse. We will be looking for bids which contain projects addressing these major public concerns in London.\n\nHousing and Regeneration London has about two-thirds of the nation's most deprived housing. Of the local authority stock, more than 7 out of every 10 properties is ether unfit or in disrepair; 1 in 4 properties were built before 1945; and 1 in 4 properties are in blocks of flats greater than 5 storeys. Many of the most deprived communities will live in Council accommodation and SRB bids which complement housing investment programmes will be welcomed.\n\nPublic Health and Child Care The key factors that influence health in London are: those associated with economic and social developments affecting employment, income and opportunities; diversity of different population groups; and physical environment. These factors interact with behavioural and lifestyle practices which then give rise to the inequities in health status that exist in different parts of the capital. For example, premature mortality (dying before the age of 65) can differ between boroughs by a factor of 50. Cardiovascular disease remains the biggest cause of premature death amongst Londoners.\n\nThe younger aged population of London gives rise to pressing health concerns. For example: mental health - especially amongst young men in the inner city; accidents; substance misuse; unintended pregnancies - abortion rates are the highest in the country; and higher levels of HIV/AIDS - AIDS related mortality is now the most common cause of death in men aged 15 to 54 and the second most common cause in women of the same age in Inner London.\n\nSome communicable diseases, notably tuberculosis, are on the increase with notification and mortality rates in some Boroughs being six times higher than the national average.\n\nSRB proposals which demonstrate ways to reduce the inequities in health that exist in London are particularly welcome.\n\nOver one quarter of London's residents are aged 0 to 19 - a total of 1.8 million - the proportion varies from borough to borough and is highest in Newham (33%) and lowest in Westminster (19%).\n\nThe areas that present the biggest challenges and opportunities for child health are: reduction of infant mortality, particularly in the poorer sectors of the population; reduction in childhood accidents; changes in behaviours such as smoking, substance misuse and physical activity; reduction in teenage pregnancy; and mental health. The social and economic conditions in which children find themselves will impact on their health and the need for health and welfare services.\n\nSRB bids which consider London's children will be welcome, particularly bids which address ways to reduce inequalities and improve: inter-agency working for children; appropriateness and accessibility of children's services; and child friendly employment practices. Bids concerned with social exclusion, transport, housing, education, training and future employment will also impact on child health.\n\nEnvironmental Sustainability Environmental problems associated with urban areas reflect the damage caused by economic growth which failed to take account of environmental impacts. London is one of the world's most pressurised urban environments, where the challenge of sustainable development is particularly acute. The challenge is to develop strategies which link environmental sustainability with policies aimed at achieving economic competitiveness and improving social cohesion. All three components of sustainable urban development should be represented, with the two components of social cohesion and environmental sustainability not treated as secondary to the pursuit of economic growth or as constraints to growth not treated secondary to the pursuit of economic growth or as constraints to growth.\n\nEuropean Funding\nObjective Two and European Community Initiatives Over the period 1994-99, parts of London will benefit from around £140 million in grants from the European Community's Structural Funds (European Regional Development Fund and European Social Fund).\n\nAbout £116 million is distributed under the East London and Lee Valley Objective 2 Programmes 1994-96 and 1997-99, which seek to promote the economic regeneration of the most deprived parts of six north and east London boroughs through an integrated package of business support, infrastructure, and training activities. Under the second Objective 2 programme, ESF grants for vocational training projects in 1997 and 1998 are now committed. Around £26 million in ERDF grants will be formally committed to business support and infrastructure projects during the autumn. Further ERDF and ESF bidding rounds are expected to be launched towards the end of this year.\n\nParts of London are also eligible for Structural Funds grants under smaller, more narrowly defined, \"Community Initiative\" programmes. The \"Urban\" initiative addresses the needs of excluded communities in 9 wards in 5 London boroughs by developing their capacity for bringing forward solutions for the economic regeneration of their local areas. About £11 million in ERDF and ESF grants has been allocated. Local Action Plans, identifying needs and priorities, are currently being finalised. When these have been agreed, expenditure will be committed locally. The \"Retex\" initiative addresses problems caused by the loss of textile and clothing jobs in the Objective 2 area. The full programme allocation of £800,000 has now been committed. The \"Konver\" initiative targets areas affected by the run down of the defence industry in 5 London boroughs. Around £9 million has been allocated to the programme. A final bidding round will be held in autumn 1998. The \"SMEs\" initiative aims to encourage small businesses within the Objective 2 area to be more competitive internationally, thereby increasing export potential. Around £1.7 million is allocated to the programme. Discussions are currently taking place on how the Programme might best be delivered.\n\nObjective 3 and 4 Objective 3 funding aims to assist the long term unemployed and young people into work through the provision of guidance, vocational training and wage subsidy schemes. Around £90m will be spent in London by the non-Government sector in the 1997-99 programme period on such measures. In addition, there is funding available to support projects which help to equalise workplace opportunities between men and women and projects which aim to increase access to Objective 3 support by groups which suffer particular disadvantage in the labour market. Objective 3 is available all over London but in 1999 projects which target priority community areas will attract a few extra points in the scoring process. The deadline for bids for 1999 funding is 19 October 1998.\n\nObjective 4 is a new programme for which around £16m is available in London in 1998-99. It aims to help facilitate the adaptation of workers to industrial change, focusing on those employees of small and medium-sized enterprises who are threatened with unemployment or affected by industrial change or changes in production systems. It will support the strategy for workforce development set out in the Green paper 'The Learning Age'; thus, Objective 4 projects may support such initiatives as the University for Industry, Individual learning Accounts and Investors in People. Bidding for 1999 funds will open on 4 January and close in Mid-to-late February 1999.\n\nBoth Objective 3 and 4 ESF monies can be used to match SRB funds. A new programme for 2000 and beyond is still under negotiation but may see Objectives 3 and 4 merged into a single new Objective.\n\n PRIORITY COMMUNITY AREAS\nThe Map below is indicative of priority community areas in London, most of which fall within the target boroughs listed in Annex A. These 68 priority community areas have been identified as being the focal points of need and deprivation. These have been selected on the basis of wards where the index of deprivation exceeds a score of 15 and additionally those wards with a score of between 10 and 15 where there is a high proportion of long-term unemployed. \n\nIt is clear from the map that there is a great concentration of priority areas in inner North and East London. The Lee Valley and outer east London show further concentrations. A widespread distribution throughout inner South London from Abbey Wood to East Wandsworth is clear. A further focus is in the southern half of Brent and around Park Royal. There are one or two isolated locations in outer London primarily reflecting major public housing schemes.\n\nThe identified priority community areas are not intended to be an exhaustive list of bid areas but are indicative of those areas which are likely to have local regeneration need. 62 of these priority community areas are in the most deprived districts listed at Annex A, where we are seeking to support large comprehensive regeneration schemes. The other 6 community areas we have identified may bid against the more limited resources available for other areas of need.\n\nPriority issues for sustainable community regeneration are discussed above. In addition to addressing needs of the community, bidders should always ensure full participation in partnerships of the community and voluntary sector. Bids led by such organisations, in partnership with local authorities, education and training providers and the private sector, should establish clear visions and priorities for the area. Bids with outcomes targeted on Black and ethnic minorities or other disadvantaged groups should involve appropriate voluntary and community groups in the design, management and implementation of projects.\n\nPHYSICAL AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES\nThe pattern of business activity and employment in London is dominated by Central London, and the series of corridors radiating out from the inner area. Lea Valley, to the north, and Thames Gateway, to the east, pivot around Stratford and are clearly defined. West London opportunities fan out along a number of road, rail and canal corridors, underpinned by Heathrow and Park Royal. Those in South London are focused on the Wandle Valley. Clusters of small enterprises are also scattered throughout inner south and east London, often grouped around local town centres.\n\nThese are the key target areas for new development, business growth and the creation of new jobs. Investment , particularly in East London, is required to modernise and restructure less competitive areas to attract sustainable mixed use development and diversify the economic base. Integrated area management strategies, based around key nodes, should define new economic roles, link land availability to new sources of growth, and develop pathways between the job opportunities being created and associated areas of deprivation and high unemployment.\n\n- Central Area\nSustaining London's world city functions, based in and around the City and West End, are fundamental to the City's future prosperity. Bringing forward for development the major sites which ring the central area, at Kings Cross, Paddington and Bishopsgate/ Spitalfields is a key objective, both to facilitate growth and link inner city communities to central area job opportunities. \n\nThe development of successful entry points and clear pathways to central area employment will continue to be crucial; also the need to develop stronger outreach between central area employers and inner city communities. The City Fringe and South Bank are particularly important in this respect. The City Fringe offers opportunities based around the consolidation of its traditional functions, and the development of new business services, cultural industries and media sectors. The successful regeneration of the South Bank is not only a key priority in its own right but also provides an essential stepping stone in integrating inner South London communities more closely with Central Area opportunities. Elephant and Castle is strategically positioned to consolidate and extend the regeneration process.\n\n- Thames Gateway\nThames Gateway contains a significant proportion of London's brownfield development land, and is a focus for future London growth. The sites often have significant problems of access, dereliction and contamination. A key challenge will be to bring forward proposals for major mixed use development on these sites which integrate new communities into the existing urban structure. The enhancement of transport linkages will play an important part in the long term achievement of Thames Gateways potential, together with the development of supportive environmental and social infrastructure.\n\nThe area needs to consolidate its existing industrial base, notably at Fords Dagenham and Belvedere, and to acquire new economic and business sectors to underpin development on the north side of the river, and establish new sources of employment for communities on the south side such as Woolwich where past structural decline has led to widespread deprivation. Considerable progress is being made in the growth area of leisure and tourism and needs to be consolidated.\n\nThe regeneration of Thames Gateway will inevitably take place over a long period of time. Some of the key sites are more advanced than others and careful planning and interleaving of the phasing on individual sites will be required.\n\n-East London and Lea Valley\nEast London and the Lea Valley contains a series of well defined employment nodes centred around the green axis area provided by the River Lea and the Lea Valley Regional Park, and flanked by high density deprived communities particularly at the southern end.Added importance derives from its designation as an Objective 2 area under the European Regional Development Fund.\n\nThe consolidation of its remaining manufacturing areas continues to be of key importance, through infrastructural improvement, business innovation and technological development. At the same time area needs to diversify its economy and secure a greater share of London's growth sectors, particularly in services. The expansion of Stansted Airport provides an important potential new source of growth and jobs for the area and demands an integrated response.\n\nStratford, with its extensive associated development lands, and pivotal transport role enhanced by the Jubilee Line and International Passenger Station, is a key opportunity to create a new character for the area, based upon high quality development. The large scale commercial development at Canary Wharf provides a further opportunity , together with the exhibition centre/technology and business park initiatives in the Royal Docks.\n\n- West London\nThe continued vitality of the West London economy is essential to London's long term economic health and prosperity. Heathrow is a key element, both as an employer in its own right, and as a generator of airport related services and industries, and attraction for international headquarters. There is scope to focus these benefits further on deprived parts of West London in relatively close proximity to the airport; notably Hayes and Feltham.\n\nPark Royal is the other major anchor in the West London economy. Consolidation of its position through development of key gateway sites, public transport access, and infrastructural improvement, is of particular importance to deprived west London communities within its hinterland.\n\nRestructuring of other major nodes, including Wembley and Southall/Parkway is also important, to improve their economic competitiveness, attract sustainable development and create new employment opportunities \n\n-South London\nEmployment areas in South London are significantly less well developed than in the other sectors. Aside from the Thames Gateway the principal economic axis is the Wandle Valley linking a chain of older industrial estates and development sites between Wandsworth and Croydon. Improving the competitiveness of these areas and attracting, new sources of employment is the key priority.\n\nTransport and Accessibility\nMobility and the reduction of barriers to isolation are vital factors in the regeneration of London's most deprived areas. Low levels of car ownership, wide variation in accessibility in Inner London and strong imbalances between priority communities and employment opportunity all serve to underline this point. Critical journeys affect the employability, social inclusion and quality of life of those in priority regeneration communities.\n\nThe Government has recently outlined its Transport Priorities in the Integrated Transport White Paper. In London, there is a clear need to address the need for improving the attractiveness and scope of public transport through interchanges and upgrading of infrastructure.\n\nParticularly important are those transport hubs and local access strategies which will secure the consolidation of key regeneration areas within the City Fringe, Park Royal and Willesden, Heathrow and Hayes/West Drayton employment opportunities, the Lee valley and the Royal Docks.\n\n SUMMARY\n\nBids must be based on the following principles:\n\nhave a clear focus, based on thorough research and consultation with the local residential and business communities, and set out the key problems they are addressing and the impact they intend to achieve;\n\nbe submitted by a broadly based partnership involving local authority, education and training providers, private, voluntary and community sectors;\n\nbe designed to deliver a broad range of outcomes and outputs to address the needs of the area as a whole and demonstrate an integrated approach to sustainable development in three respects: economic competitiveness, social cohesion and environmental sustainability.\n\nhave a clear exit/forward strategy to ensure proposals are sustainable; \n\nhave linkages with other housing and regeneration initiatives and Government funding e.g. existing SRB programmes, Welfare to Work, Estates Renewal Challenge Fund, European funding programmes etc. and demonstrate added value;\n\nThe prime emphasis in London in Round 5 will be on bids which :\n\naddress youth and long term unemployment directly in priority communities, including opportunities for education and training;\n\ndemonstrate clear and stable pathways from local communities to London's broader opportunities; \n\ndirectly address the retention development or expansion of employment in the key economic areas discussed in this Framework; \n\nseek to raise educational attainment, particularly in the Education Action Zones; \n\naddress skills and lifelong learning, including widening participation in education; \n\nfully integrate business support, training education and employment initiatives with demonstrable transfer of benefit to local communities; \n\naddress crime and the fear of crime;\n\noffer equal opportunities for all Londoners and tackle the needs of London's ethnic minorities and other disadvantaged groups; \n\ndemonstrably reduce the social, cultural, economic, learning and physical isolation of priority communities: the effective commitment of partnerships to community capacity building will, for most types of scheme, be a requisite for approval;\n\nrealistically address the improvement of physical and environmental quality in both the community and the workplace. \n\n GOVERNMENT OFFICE FOR LONDON\n\nANNEX A\n\nThe London Boroughs targeted in the list of the 'most deprived' urban local authority districts, at Annex C of the Round 5 Bidding Guidance, are as follows :-\n\nTower Hamlets Kensington and Chelsea Southwark City of Westminster Islington Greenwich Lambeth Haringey Lewisham Barking and Dagenham Ealing Camden Hammersmith and Fulham Wandsworth Brent Waltham Forest Newham Hackney\n\n ANNEX B\n\nGOVERNMENT OFFICE FOR LONDONSRB CONTACTS\nBidders wishing to discuss this Framework document, strategic regeneration bids, cross-river issues or transport aspects might like to contact:\n\nJOHN SIENKIEWICZ     0171-217 3015\n\nBidders wishing to discuss area based bids should ring the appropriate contact below:\n\nCity ; Barnet; Brent ; Ealing; Hammersmith and Fulham; Hillingdon ; Westminster DON THOMAS     0171-217 3020\n\nCamden ; Harrow; Hounslow; Islington; Kensington and Chelsea SARAH STURROCK     0171-217 3077\n\nBexley; Bromley; Croydon; Greenwich; Lewisham; Sutton JANET LUDBROOK     0171-217 3042\n\nKingston; Lambeth; Merton; Richmond; Southwark; Wandsworth FRED HACKMAN     0171-217 3302\n\nBarking; Havering; Newham; Tower Hamlets JEFF HOLLINGWORTH     0171-217 3029\n\nEnfield; Hackney; Haringey; Redbridge; Waltham Forest ANNA MACDONALD     0171-217 3032\n\nBidders wishing to discuss business-support bids should contact:\n\nALLAN FERRIES     0171-217 3227\n\nThe GOL contact for training and education led bids is: MELANIE RICKMAN     0171-217 3308\n\nRequests for additional copies of the Bidding Guidance, Regional Framework or general enquiries on the SRB should be made to the SRB ENQUIRY UNIT     0171-217 3062\n\nBidders wishing to discuss possible European funding support should contact, as appropriate, FRANC SULLIVAN  (for ERDF)   0171-217 3067 IAIN McNAB   (for ESF)   0171-217 3315\n\n INTRODUCTION\n1.    This guidance has been produced by Government Office North West for prospective bidders under SRB Round 5. It supplements the national bidding guidance and should be read in conjunction with it. The purpose of this document is to set a strategic context within which the bids for 1999/2000 will be considered by GONW and the Regional Development Agency.\n\n2.    The Framework has been informed by discussion with the Rural Development Commission, the NW RDA Secretariat, English Partnerships, INWARD and the NW Regional Chamber.\n\nBackground - Regional Issues\n3.    The North West is a major region, with the largest economy in the UK after London, and the South East, producing almost 11% of the UK Gross Domestic Product. GDP per head is however 11% below the UK average, and 13% below the European average. It contains 6.9 million people, 1 in 8 of UK's population and 1 in 50 of the EU urban core. Outside Cumbria the North West Region is 6 times more densely populated than the EU average and 4 times more densely populated than the UK average. Even including predominantly rural Cumbria the North West is 3 times more densely populated than the EU average. Most of the population (58%) lives in the conurbations of Greater Manchester (2.6 million) and Merseyside (1.4 million), but 80% of the land area remains open countryside.\n\n4.    One of the World's first industrial regions, it is still a major manufacturing centre but has experienced steady decline in traditional manufacturing employment over the last four decades. The region has consequently experienced high levels of unemployment especially in its urban centres, where despite progress, under-achievement in basic literacy, numeracy and IT skills needs remedying. There is also a legacy of poor quality housing conditions, a close mix of residential areas and heavy industry adjacent to the West Coast Main Line, pollution, and outdated surface and underground infrastructure. The region's substantial rural areas, ranging from South Cheshire to the remote North Pennines, also have problems ranging from local income to high levels of crime. The narrowness of the economy and general access are main concerns.\n\nRegional Development Themes\n5.    The broad consensual themes for the future development of the North West are well established in key strategy documents such as North West Partnership's Economic Strategy and Regional Competitiveness Strategy. They are that the North West should become:\n\na world class centre for the production of high quality goods and services;\n\na Region where profitable, successful companies able to compete on a global scale are increasing;\n\na Region that attracts new business by providing a choice of suitable sites and premises;\n\na Region seeking to raise the standards and achievement levels in education and training to world class levels;\n\na Region dedicated to the recruitment, retention and effective use of highly skilled people within North West Businesses;\n\na Region characterised by the widespread availability and use of leading-edge information and communication technology;\n\na Region that is attractive and safe to live, work and invest in, and to visit;\n\na Region with a well managed, balanced and efficient transport system which contributes to national sustainability objectives;\n\na Region determined to tackle the huge problem of housing unfitness and supportive of the Government's target for more brownfield housing development.\n\na region amongst the very best in Europe and elsewhere and achieving greater cohesion within the region by addressing the needs of deprived areas and the needs of the least advantaged of its residents.\n\nSRB resources will be used to help the North West work towards these aims.\n\n SRB Resources for 1999/2000 - 2001/2002\n6.    Regional allocations for new schemes will depend upon the level of existing commitments from SRB Rounds 1-4. Present indications are that approximately £15m will be available for new schemes in 1999/2000 and about £139m to fund activities in the two financial years 2000/1 and 2001/2 including future bidding rounds. The approximate split of resources between comprehensive and local regeneration schemes is likely to be:-\n\n\t \n\t1999/00\n\t2000/01\n\t2001/02\n\tTOTAL\n\n\tComprehensive Regeneration Schemes\n\t£12m\n\t£39m\n\t£72m\n\t£123\n\n\tLocal Regeneration schemes\n\t£3m\n\t£10m\n\t£18m\n\t£31m\n\n\tTOTALS\n\t£15m\n\t£49m\n\t£90m\n\t£154m\n\n\n7.   Ministers have indicated that they wish to see the majority of SRB Round 5 resources targeted towards large, comprehensive schemes in the most deprived districts nationally according to the Index of Local Deprivation and as identified in the national Bidding Guidance (see extract at Annex A (Annex C in the Bidding Guidance)). In Round 5 resources will be concentrated on a small number (5 or 6) of comprehensive regeneration bids of about £20m-£25m. There may be exceptional circumstances where bids of a lesser value would be considered. Partnerships should contact the Government Office about funding levels. Individual schemes may run from one to seven years. The bulk of expenditure on comprehensive regeneration schemes will be expected to take place over five years. However, capacity building at the neighbourhood level and the creation of effective ways to broaden opportunities is not a quick process, so a full seven years expenditure on such elements will be expected.\n\n8.   Outside the most deprived areas identified in Annex A, it will be possible to support a small number of modest bids from identifiable pockets of need in other rural and urban areas in the region. These will include bids from coalfield, rural and coastal areas.\n\n9.   Successful bids, unless they are by established Partnerships and build on existing initiatives, are likely to have only modest project costs in Year 1. New or Community led Partnerships should regard Year 1 as a development year to ensure that Partnership and management systems are in place with significant expenditure commencing in Year 2. Established Partnerships, especially those building on existing initiatives, are expected to bid for and incur expenditure in Year 1. All Partnerships should include realistic expenditure in their financial profiles. With the need for Delivery Plans to be agreed and appraisals approved, SRB resources are unlikely to be released before September/October 1999.\n\nNorth West Priority Issues\n10.   It is expected that the majority of Round 5 bids will be area based. There is scope for thematic bids which address single themes but they will need to clearly concentrate resources on combating deprivation and social exclusion.\n\n11.   Priority activities for the North West remain similar to those for Round 4, and those issues emerging from key regional strategies. Many of these issues will be reflected in the Regional Economic Strategy which will be prepared by the Regional Development Agency. The RES will provide a framework for Regional and economic development and establish priorities for programmes including Round 5 SRB. In the meantime bids, whether for comprehensive or local regeneration schemes, should aim to tackle social exclusion and community capacity building. In addition they should address one or more of the following priorities:-\n\nreflect the needs of the urban areas of the Region, particularly those communities suffering from multiple-deprivation requiring action on the health and education fronts as well as tackling poor living standards;\n\nenable innovative health activities which tackle inequalities associated with social and economic circumstance;\n\ntie in with priorities identified by the Coalfields Task Force and address the problems associated with former Coalfields areas;\n\naddress the needs of Rural Development Areas, such as low wages, SME competitiveness, diversification of the local economy, access to services and facilities and the needs for balanced communities meeting the needs of young and old;\n\ntackle educational progression and achievement from childhood onwards, including an emphasis on parenting skills;\n\npropose effective partnership-based methods for achieving the wider regional objectives of improving educational attainment including those for Welfare to Work, contributing to local capacity building via ethnic minority, voluntary and community sector activities, and involving young people in the pursuit of sustainability through environmental task forces;\n\npromote imaginative and value for money routes into employment beyond traditional job creation measures through, for example, support for intermediate labour market measures to improve confidence and extend opportunities of job and training choice particularly the socially excluded; through expanding the tourism industry in the Region; developing appropriate public transport in line with the objectives of the Transport White Paper;\n\naddress the needs of areas and/or residents suffering from crime and the fear of crime through the development of innovative schemes involving local communities, the unemployed and ethnic minorities as well as the police and the local authority. Proposals should be consistent with the measures in the Crime and Disorder Act;\n\ndemonstrate that SRB will bring added value to resources released for housing and through New Deal for Communities;\n\ndemonstrate that SRB, probably in conjunction with other forms of funding and private investment, is needed to ensure that some small and medium-sized enterprises become competitive as a result of being willing and able to embrace new technological methods, and link the benefits of that to local communities;\n\ndevelop business support, particularly business start ups with particular emphasis on using innovation in technology and knowledge to increase economic competitiveness;\n\nthe development of city and town centres to create safe and thriving areas across the region, particularly building upon town centre management experience;\n\ntake forward the environmental sustainability agenda at the local level and activities which deliver direct benefits to business competitiveness;\n\nrecognise the importance of heritage and the arts in regeneration;\n\n Synergy\n12.   SRB proposals should be developed within wider local regeneration strategies. These strategies should show how the proposed SRB activity would add value to:\n\na.mainstream public sector programmes and services, especially those delivered by local authorities and the TECs and Business Links;\n\nb.Government initiatives especially Welfare to Work but also, where relevant, Employment, Health and Education Action Zones, and the New Deal for Communities Pathfinders;\n\nc.the regional and local strategies of bodies such as English Partnerships, the North West Regional Chamber and the Rural Development Commission;\n\nd.the priorities identified by the Coalfields Task Force;\n\ne.housing strategies and priorities addressed in New Deal for Communities;\n\nf.European Funding particularly Action Plans and Pathways.\n\n13.   Proposals should also be consistent with policies set out in the Regional Planning Guidance for the North West, the Regional Competitiveness Strategy and the region's Single Programming Documents.\n\nAssessment of Bids\n14.   Successful bids will need to show that they represent broadly based Partnerships directly involving communities and provide comprehensive approaches to the priority needs set out in the guidance.\n\n15.   Partnership development and management will be particularly important in the assessment of bids. Partnerships will increasingly need to develop consultative structures with those people that regeneration objectives seek to touch and serve, and to respond to community needs and aspirations rather than dictate top-down solutions. Bidders will normally be expected to check and demonstrate the sustainability of their proposals. This will be important in the evaluation of bids by GONW/RDA. Evidence that Partnerships have considered their Forward Strategies will be a key part of each bid's sustainability.\n\n16.   The content of bids will be assessed with careful regard to their proposals to address social exclusion and enhance opportunities for those at a disadvantage in the areas of greatest need. They should add value to and not duplicate any existing partnership activity in these deprived areas. This could be achieved through the development of sustainable community based responses to local need and more effective targeting of existing and proposed programmes and services.\n\n17.   Community based initiatives such as credit unions, development trusts and Local Exchange and Trading Systems (LETS) have been a feature of regeneration activities over a number of years. The Government also wants to support the growing movement towards innovative community enterprise and investment schemes, including those which encourage innovative approaches to access to capital. There is scope within the North West's allocation for providing up to £50,000 SRB on such pilot schemes on a match funding basis. Potential bidders should note that this sum is not ringfenced. Any Partnership should contact GONW if they wish to consider a community based initiative to discuss available resources.\n\n18.   The proposals should demonstrate clear linkages with other regeneration activity and main programme priorities. Local partnerships will be expected to demonstrate the active involvement of relevant public agencies, private and voluntary sector interests and local residents in the preparation and proposed implementation of their proposals. Public sector partners such as English Partnerships should be contacted by bidders whilst outline proposals are being developed to ensure their active commitment. They will also need to provide assurance that effective local management systems will be in place and that projects will be rigorously appraised.\n\n19.   Partnerships should ensure that outputs are clearly defined as \"core\" or \"complementary\" depending upon whether the Partnership has control over their delivery. GONW will be able to provide specific advice on individual definitions.\n\n20.   A key issue in assessing bids will be the extent, quality and importance of the planned outcomes that are planned and the significance of the impact the bid would have on the problems it addresses. It is particularly important for bids to identify a clear baseline position. Bids will also be assessed against the emerging priorities of the North West Regional Development Agency as responsibility for SRB will transfer to the NW RDA on 1 April 1999. Outline Round 5 proposals will be assessed by GONW in consultation with the RDA Shadow Board. Final bids will be appraised by the RDA, with decisions taken by Ministers. Details of the proposed hand over arrangements will be provided later in the year. The assessment timetable is shown in Chapter 6 of the National SRB Guidance.\n\nLiaison with GONW\n21.   Local partnerships will need to work closely with GONW in the preparation of their bids to ensure that they receive the best possible advice and guidance. In particular, Partnerships in the priority areas should involve GONW in the development of local regeneration strategies and the proposed comprehensive schemes. Partnerships looking to access European Funding to support their SRB bid should contact the European Secretariat to discuss the likely availability of resources (subject to the necessary legislation) and ensure linkages with CED's. It is equally important that potential bidders in rural areas liaise closely with the Rural Development Commission as well as GONW.\n\n22.   Bids which have not been the subject of informal discussion ahead of the 27 November deadline are much less likely to succeed. Bidders will wish to discuss their proposals and spending profiles with GONW to ensure that they build flexibility into their profiles and activities.\n\n Statement of Regional Regeneration Priorities\n1.    The purpose of this statement is to supplement the national bidding guidance for the SRB Challenge Fund (SRBCF) : the Bidding Guidance document for SRBCF Round 5 issued on 9th September 1998\n\n2.     It sets out the priorities which the South East England Development Agency (SEEDA) will apply in addition to national guidance, when assessing proposals for awarding funding under SRBCF Round 5.\n\n3.     Successive SRBCF Rounds have been very competitive and Round 5 continues the trend, with more emphasis placed on quality of partnerships and agreed local vision. The level of resources available in Round 5 is significantly more than in Round 4.\n\n4.     The indicative allocation for the South East under Round 5 breaks down to:\n\nYear 1 (1999/2000)    £ 4 - 5 million Each subsequent year    £ 9 - 11 million\n\nIn the case of the large scale regeneration schemes referred to in paragraph 10a. we would expect the bulk of expenditure to take place over 5 years. For other schemes referred to in paragraphs 10b and 11 funding will be available for 1 -7 years, if resources permit.\n\n5.     Partnerships must consider carefully whether bidding for Challenge Funding is the most appropriate way to secure additional funding for their regeneration strategy. Preparing proposals which have some likelihood of success takes a great deal of time and effort, with no certainty of an award.\n\n6.   The South East has a competitive economy in UK terms, supplying just over 15% of the UK's GDP. However prosperity is not evenly spread. The 1998 Index of Local Deprivation (ILD) highlights this. There are pockets of social exclusion and deprivation across the Region. \n\n7.   In order to maintain and improve competitiveness the region must address constraints on its capacity to accommodate economic growth. This involves ensuring that individuals and communities across the whole of the South East can benefit from and contribute to economic success; and ensuring that the quality of the environment is maintained and enhanced. The Challenge Fund provides support to locally driven regeneration initiatives and funding will be targeted to areas of greatest need.\n\n8.    The priorities set out below give a clear indication of how SEEDA intends to target resources to areas of greatest need. This will help partnerships decide whether or not to put forward proposals in Round 5.\n\n9.     Partnerships wanting to submit proposals for Round 5 must meet the geographic and partnership priorities set out below, in addition to the requirements of the Bidding Guidance. Moreover, partnerships with funding from previous SRBCF rounds must demonstrate a good track record on delivery of schemes and community involvement.\n\n10.    Geographic Priorities - To target Challenge Fund resources to areas of greatest need:\n\nPriority will be given to proposals from partnerships primarily addressing needs in the following geographical locations:-\n\na) those local authority districts that have been targeted by DETR Ministers as within the top tranche of most deprived local authority districts as determined by the 1998 Index of Local Deprivation (ILD). These areas are designated by the highest levels of deprivation at district, ward or enumeration district level, on any of the 4 ILD measures. For the South East Region these local authority districts are Brighton & Hove, Portsmouth and Southampton. For these three local authority districts we will consider proposals that consolidate existing investment and activity.\n\nb) those ward level areas whose scores are sufficient to rank them amongst the 10%most deprived in England (i.e. Ward level areas that score greater or equal to8.97 as determined by 1998 ILD.) For the South East Region these are shown in the table below.\n\n\tAREA\n\tDISTRICT\n\tWARD NAME\n\n\tHampshire & Isle of Wight\n\tHavant\n\tWarren Park\n\n\t\n\t\n\tBattins\n\n\tSurrey & East, West Sussex\n\tWorthing\n\tCentral\n\n\t\n\tWealden\n\tHailsham East\n\n\t\n\tHastings\n\tCastle\n\n\t\n\t\n\tCentral St. Leonard's\n\n\t\n\tEastbourne\n\tDevonshire\n\n\tBerkshire, Oxfordshire & Buckinghamshire\n\tSlough\n\tStoke\n\n\t\n\tReading\n\tAbbey\n\n\t\n\t\n\tKatesgrove\n\n\t\n\t\n\tWhitely\n\n\t\n\tOxford\n\tSt. Clement's\n\n\t\n\t\n\tBlackbird Leys\n\n\t\n\t\n\tEast\n\n\t\n\tMilton Keynes\n\tEaton\n\n\t\n\t\n\tFenny Stratford\n\n\tKent\n\tThanet\n\tEthelbert\n\n\t\n\t\n\tNewington\n\n\t\n\t\n\tNorthdown Park\n\n\t\n\t\n\tPier\n\n\t\n\tShepway\n\tFolkestone Central\n\n\t\n\t\n\tFolkestone East\n\n\t\n\tSwale\n\tSheerness West\n\n\t\n\tMedway Towns\n\tHolcombe\n\n\t\n\t\n\tLuton\n\n\t\n\t\n\tPark Wood\n\n\t\n\tCanterbury\n\tNorth Nailbourne\n\n\nProposals from the priority areas in the table will need to be clearly focused at ward level.\n\n11.     In addition we wish to support proposals from:-\n\nPartnerships based across the Thames Gateway in North Kent. The Thames Gateway remains the most significant development area within the South East with particular importance attached to the promotion of strong partnerships, sustainable development and the need to ensure that local people share in the regeneration of the area. \n\nKent based partnerships for the regeneration of Kent Coalfields. The development of coalfield sites has been identified by Ministers for priority action, particularly to promote strong local partnerships as recommended in the Coalfield Task Force Report. The map at Annex 2 shows the wards, within the Kent Coalfield, which have been identified for attention. \n\nIsle of Wight. As an island, it faces unique difficulties in tackling unemployment and deprivation.\n\nRural Development Areas. As in Annex D of the National Bidding Guidance bids are invited which address the priority needs and opportunities within a Rural Development Area and that have been identified in the Rural Development Programme and other relevant local strategies.\n\nThe map at Annex 1 shows all the areas we wish to target.\n Partnership Priorities \n12.     Bids must come from partnerships of appropriate public, private, community and voluntary sector organisations, with sufficient capability to meet the requirements set out in the Guidance Notes and to deliver their proposed scheme. This includes new partnerships bidding for the first time.\n\n13.   Partnerships must show clear linkages with local area based initiatives and public programmes as appropriate.\n\n14.   Experience shows the more innovative schemes have a clear geographical focus, are based on thorough research and active involvement with residents on the needs of an area and submitted by a broad based partnership. Many of the best schemes deliver a broad range of outputs designed to address the needs of an area as a whole. Single purpose bids may be supported provided they are set in the context of a regeneration strategy for the area. The effective commitment of partnerships to community capacity building will be a criterion of support. Where bids include physical development, especially of derelict land, bidders should consult English Partnerships.\n\n15.   The Region expects an allocation of up to £120,000 to support innovative community enterprise and investment schemes. This funding will be available on a matched funding basis to a limit of £50,000 per scheme. Partnerships considering such proposals should contact GOSE as soon as possible.\n\n16.   Existing partnerships will be aware of the possibilities for European funding available in their areas and its use to improve value for money in regeneration schemes. New partnerships who wish to know more about European funding should contact John Pinnell at GOSE; telephone 01483 882541. \n\nBidding Arrangements\n17.     Partnerships MUST contact GOSE to discuss their proposals as soon as possible. Proposals received at the 'expression of interest' (outline bid) deadline without any previous contact with GOSE will NOT be supported. Bids from Rural Development Areas must also contact the Rural Development Commission.\n\n18.     You will note from the bidding guidance that submission of final bids should be made to the SEEDA, rather than GOSE, and it is SEEDA who will be making recommendations to Ministers on winners. SEEDA will become operational on 1 April 1999. Allan Willett is the Chairman designate and has been consulted in drawing up this guidance. More detailed information on location, contacts and hand-over arrangements will be given to appropriate bidders before the final bidding stage.\n\n\tGOSE contacts:\n\t \n\t \n\n\t \n\t \n\t \n\n\tHampshire and Isle of Wight\n\tJohn Dunk\n\t01483 882320\n\n\tSurrey, East and West Sussex\n\tAngela Hammond\n\t01483 882385\n\n\tOxfordshire, Berkshire and Buckinghamshire\n\tPat Tempany\n\t01483 882420\n\n\tKent\n\tPhil West\n\t01483 882457\n\n\t \n\t \n\t \n\n\tRural Development Commission contacts:\n\t \n\t \n\n\t \n\t \n\t \n\n\tKent and East Sussex\n\tAnne Knight\n\t01622 765222\n\n\tIsle of Wight\n\tMark Chessil\n\t01983 528019\n\n\n\n Resources\n1.   We expect to have in the range of £6m-£8m available for new schemes in 1999/2000 and about £16m-£18m in 2000/01 and 2001/02.\n\n2.   It will be helpful if bidders discuss proposed spending profiles with GO-WM before submitting a final bid and that they think carefully about building flexibility into their profiles.\n\nNeed\n3.   The approach adopted in the Round 4 West Midlands Framework was close to the pattern of priorities emerging from the Regeneration Comprehensive Spending Review. There is therefore no need for a major restatement of the framework in the light of Round 5.\n\n4.   The West Midlands has two authorities - Birmingham and Sandwell - which feature in the top ten most deprived Districts in the Index of Deprivation. The scale and intensity of deprivation in Birmingham and Sandwell is of special concern and bids which concentrate effort and resources to achieve a lasting impact in these most deprived areas of the region will be actively encouraged.\n\n5.   A number of other West Midlands Districts exhibit deprivation well above the national average according to the Index of Deprivation. Bids specifically targeted on meeting needs in Wolverhampton, Walsall, Coventry and Stoke-on-Trent will be welcomed.\n\n6.   It is expected that schemes in the above six areas will account for eighty per cent of resources available for new projects in the West Midlands.\n\n7.   The remaining twenty per cent of resources are available to meet pockets of need which may be identified more widely across the region. Bids targeted on the needs of small areas, including rural and ex-coalfields communities, and supported by detailed deprivation and other relevant data applicable to the area will be considered for funding from the twenty per cent.\n\nWest Midlands Priority Themes\n8.   First, the region is home to a significant population from black and minority ethnic communities. The age structure of these communities tends to be younger than the regional average. They suffer disproportionately from long term, especially male long term, unemployment. English remains the second language within some communities presenting particular challenges in the education system and the workplace. Regrettably racial discrimination is still perceived to be an obstacle to success for many of these communities. It is important that the SRB backs schemes which will help these groups to share better in the prosperity of the region. Bids which directly involve ethnic minority communities as partners in the planning and delivery of initiatives will be particularly welcomed.\n\n9.   Secondly, the workforce of the West Midlands has historically been less qualified than the British workforce as a whole and West Midlands school leavers are less well qualified than the national average. People are the key to the region's international competitiveness. Competitive advantage is dependent on the skills, inventiveness and entrepreneurial ability of the people of the West Midlands. Priorities for the region are therefore to enable young people to achieve the highest possible levels of educational attainment, to raise the skills levels of the workforce and match these to the needs of West Midlands employers, and to improve the quality and quantity of school/business contacts. There is serious concern in the region about the attitudes in society, schools, homes towards manufacturing industry which is still a highly significant employer in the region. Changes in the culture this represents are desirable and any SRB project supporting such changes will be looked on with some favour.\n\n10.   There is evidence in some parts of the West Midlands of families who have not known the experience of working through two or more generations. In these families there is no expectation about learning or work and no sense that a route out of poverty can be found or would succeed. Action targeting this deep rooted and difficult to change aspect of economic and social dependency is also a priority for the region, as are projects which reinforce the New Deal programme, in encouraging youngsters and older people into the workplace.\n\n11.   Some of the worst concentrations of multiple deprivation occur in areas of poor housing. SRB has the potential to link improvements of the housing stock with training, education and employment opportunities for local people. Residents surveys undertaken by many local authorities show that crime and fear of crime feature high on the list of community concerns. There is scope to use the SRB to develop Community Safety initiatives linked to the partnership led Crime and Disorder strategies in the Region.\n\n12.   Proposals for improving the health of those who are the worst off and the most vulnerable in the region are a priority. Parts of the West Midlands score high against a number of indicators for poor health and are amongst the worst in the country. The health inequalities are very marked and closely linked to levels of deprivation. Major determinants of poor health in addition to those above are the environment, poor access to services (not just health services) and type of lifestyle. There are also known to be serious concerns about drugs use in both rural and urban parts of the West Midlands. SRB can be used to support efforts to develop effective responses to substance misuse which build on the work of Drugs Action Team partnerships within the region.\n\n13.   Annex E of the bidding guidance refers to innovative community enterprise schemes. Resources are included within paragraph 1 above for match funding for such schemes and it is anticipated that a small number of such schemes might be supported.\n\n14.   Priority areas of need in rural areas have already been identified by Rural Development Areas. Bids are invited that tackle relevant rural issues such as low wages, SME competitiveness, diversification of the local economy, access to services and facilities and the need for balanced communities meeting the need of young and old.\n\n Synergy\n15.   Through City Pride in Birmingham and the recently announced LGA New Commitment Pathfinders, more emphasis is now being placed on the development of broad district-wide area regeneration strategies. Where such strategic regeneration partnerships exist, SRB bids should have been discussed with the Partnership and support its strategy. Bids should also take account of English Partnership's West Midlands Regional Strategy due to be issued in September.\n\n16.   Bidders will also wish to be aware of the impact of any targeted area initiative such as, for example, Health Action Zones, Education Action Zones, which may offer scope for SRB proposals to support innovative or cross-authority approaches in local areas.\n\n17.   Bids may reinforce economic regeneration activity being undertaken through the European Structural Funds. Although the 1998 bidding round has been completed, there will be a bidding opportunity in Spring 1999. Guidance on the post-1999 European Structural Funds for the region is being negotiated.\n\nProcess\n18.   This Round of SRB is being launched in a transitional year, alongside the establishment of the Regional Development Agency. Alex Stephenson, the Chairman designate of the West Midlands RDA, has been consulted on the regional framework and it is intended that the RDA Board, when appointed, will take a view on the bids coming forward at outline stage. It will, however, be necessary for GO-WM to handle the process on behalf of the incoming RDA prior to 1 April 1999.\n\n19.   The relevant lead officers are:\n\n\tBirmingham/Coventry/Warwickshire\n\tJohn O'Shea\n\t0121 212 5214\n\n\tBlack Country\n\tMargaret Geary\n\t0121 212 5100\n\n\tThe Marches and Solihull\n\tPeter Williams\n\t0121 212 5289\n\n\tStaffordshire\n\tColin Bishop\n\t0121 212 5171\n\n\nIt is important that those bidding discuss their proposals with the lead officer of their area as early as possible in order to receive the best possible advice and guidance.\n\n Introduction\n1.   This document supplements the Single Regeneration Budget Round 5 Bidding Guidance which was launched on 8 September 1998. It aims to guide potential bidders on the needs and priorities within Yorkshire & the Humber and to indicate the scale of resources likely to be available to support these. It is intended to help structure and direct discussions between Government Office for Yorkshire & the Humber (GOYH) and those preparing Round 5 proposals.\n\n2.   The Yorkshire & the Humber Regional Development Agency Chairman-designate (Graham Hall) has been consulted during the preparation of this document and has given his support. He has indicated that he regards this bidding round as a transitional year, and it is likely that future rounds will have a sharper focus in tune with RDA priorities. Relevant regional publications are listed at Annex 1 and any Round 5 proposals will be expected to demonstrate clear linkages with the key messages they contain.\n\nRegional Context\n3.   The 1998 Index of Local Deprivation shows that many of the region's local authorities are among the worst 100 nationally. Eight local authorities, covering the whole of South Yorkshire and much of West Yorkshire, fall within the worst 50 nationally on one or more measures. There are other pockets of severe poverty and deprivation in rural areas, particularly the remote upland areas, and in those parts of the region most affected by the consequences of declining employment in traditional industries such as coal mining, textiles, metal manufacture and fishing.\n\n4.   Unemployment in the region has been falling steadily over the last three years but has remained consistently above national rates. There are wide variations in unemployment rates with pockets of very high unemployment in parts of the region and amongst particular groups, for example, ethnic minority communities. Hidden unemployment in rural areas with their greater access and delivery costs is also an issue. The proportion of people who are long term unemployed has also fallen but remains significant.\n\n5.   Gross Domestic Product has grown steadily in line with national trends. However, GDP per head was only 91.2% of the UK average in 1995, although growth in GDP per head was above the UK average. There are wide variations in GDP at sub-regional level where, for example, in South Yorkshire GDP was only 75.6% of the UK average. Although North Yorkshire displays above average levels of GDP per head, the region includes five Rural Development Areas, designated due to high concentrations of economic and social need.\n\n6.   Despite steady improvements in educational achievement and skill levels, the region lags behind a number of other regions. Improvements in GCSE performance in 1997 were above the English average and participation in education beyond 16 continues to grow. Performance across the region varies significantly and research has indicated a strong correlation between poor educational performance and social deprivation. Skills levels are improving although they remain below the national average and the present targets will be difficult to achieve. Many employers are committed to training but there remains a significant minority who need to be convinced of the benefits.\n\n7.   The region has some of the worst local authority housing stock, the physical condition of which has declined relative to other sectors, and which continues to take on an increasingly welfare role. However, concentrations of deprivation are also associated with high levels of disrepair, unfitness and low energy efficiency in private sector housing. Statistics disguise considerable differences within the region although communities living in poor housing areas are also the most likely to suffer multiple deprivation through social and economic exclusion, rising crime and poor health.\n\n8.   The next few years will see significant shifts in the resources available to support regeneration activities in different parts of the region. In particular, the targeting of European Commission programmes is currently under negotiation.\n\n Resources and Targeting\n9.   All existing commitments to SRB Rounds 1 - 4 will continue to be honoured, subject to continuing performance in line with delivery plans. New resources available to support SRB Round 5 activities within Yorkshire & the Humber will be in the order of £9-11m in 1999/2000 and £20-24m in each of the two subsequent years. The total value for Yorkshire & the Humber Round 5 funding will be in the order of £90-100m over the next five years.\n\n10.   Around 80% of the resources available over the next three years will be targeted on areas of extensive and multiple deprivation. These are defined as the areas which feature in the top 50 on one or more measures in the 1998 Index of Local Deprivation. The resulting priority areas within Yorkshire & the Humber are listed at Annex 2, and these include many of the communities which have suffered the worst effects of coal closures. Where a local authority area is included due to its position on a particular enumeration district or ward level indicator, any proposals will be expected to include measures which specifically address the needs of that locality.\n\n11.   As indicated in the Round 5 national Bidding Guidance, schemes funded from the 80% will involve large scale, comprehensive approaches to addressing regeneration needs. An average scheme value of £20-25m in SRB funding over 5 years is likely, but schemes of both higher and lower values will be supported. The resources available will not be sufficient to support such schemes in all the priority areas under Round 5, and there will continue to be competition for the available funds. Round 5 funding will provide support for 2-3 comprehensive schemes, but future spending plans allow for further large schemes in other areas to be considered in subsequent years. Round 5 resources will also allow support for some small scale activity, such as capacity building or linking of existing schemes, in priority areas which do not obtain more comprehensive support. Partnerships in priority areas may wish to consider the merits of submitting a small scale proposal alongside a more comprehensive bid, or identifying specific elements of their proposals which might be considered for individual support. Some partnerships may wish to consider submitting only a small scale bid for Round 5 support to allow for initiatives which prepare the ground for a more comprehensive proposal in a future round.\n\n12.   The remaining 20% of Round 5 resources will be used to support projects which tackle identified pockets of deprivation elsewhere. Particular priority will be given to rural areas and former coalfield areas which fall outside those local authorities listed in Annex 2. These local schemes are likely to be specifically targeted, realistic in scale, and will need to be supported by clearly evidenced indicators of need.\n\n13.   The national Bidding Guidance refers to innovative community enterprise and investment schemes. The resources indicated in paragraph 9 above include funds for schemes such as credit unions, development trusts and Local Exchange and Trading Systems and it is anticipated that a small number of such schemes might be supported. However, total regional funding for these is unlikley to exceed £300,000.\n\n14.   Support for thematic, rather than area-based, bids will also be considered where a clear case can be made for an initiative which covers a sub-region or the whole region.\n\n15.   Support will only be considered for good quality proposals which clearly demonstrate that they :\n\nreflect local circumstances;\n\nwill lead to significant impact;\n\nhave measurable outcomes which contribute to Government targets;\n\nwill provide value for money; and\n\ncan provide assurance of sound financial and operational management and monitoring arrangements.\n\nAccountable Bodies will be expected to demonstrate that they take a clear lead in ensuring the delivery, performance, quality and evaluation of successful schemes.\n\n Regional Priorities\n16.   Partnerships should adopt a strategic approach to regeneration which ensures that proposals complement and build on existing activities. Bids may build on current SRB funded schemes, and where appropriate they may pull together or extend existing SRB initiatives to ensure maximum impact and sustainability. \n\n17.   Proposals should specify how they will add value to mainstream public sector programmes and services, especially those delivered by local authorities and Training & Enterprise Councils. Linkages with other policies, area-based initiatives and strategies will need to be explicit (e.g. New Deal for Communities; Welfare to Work; Health/Education Action Zones; Crime and Disorder measures; strategies of agencies such as English Partnerships and Rural Development Commission, etc.) and proposals will need to demonstrate how local strategies complement wider sub-regional and regional strategies. In particular, they will need to show how they link with European funded activities and area-based action plans.\n\n18.   Partnerships will need to demonstrate that local communities have been fully consulted, and they are directly involved in, and supportive of, proposed schemes. Partnerships themselves will be expected to be inclusive and to take active steps to promote local participation. Proposals should address the issue of partnership capacity building and show how the local community will be engaged and equipped to participate meaningfully in the regeneration of its area. Voluntary and community sector capacity building should be linked to a properly constructed community development plan.\n\n19.   Proposals will be expected to maximise available resources through private sector leverage and other partnership contributions. Realistic assessments should be supported by clear justification, and will need to take into account the potential impact of any changes in availability of European or other funds.\n\n20.   All proposals should address social exclusion and enhance opportunities for those at a disadvantage in the areas of greatest need. Bids will need to reflect the findings of the Government's Social Exclusion Unit. In particular, the interests and needs of those from ethnic minority communities should be addressed specifically and adequately, and appropriate ethnic minority representation in partnerships will be essential. Proposals should also make clear how they will address the often inter-related issues which can place young people at a social disadvantage.\n\n21.   Priority will be given to proposals in respect of former coalfield areas. These will need to take account of the multiple deprivation identified in these areas and must clearly address the issues raised in the recent Coalfield Task Force report. Partnerships may wish to consider the possible merits of a collaborative approach to regeneration and joint proposals for addressing the needs of the region's coalfields which maximise available resources.\n\n22.   Sustainable development requires both a healthy rural environment and a healthy rural economy that respects and sustains the environment. A healthy rural economy is important for many reasons, including economic growth, conservation and combating social exclusion and poverty. Problems exist in terms of the scattered nature of local communities, the narrow economic base in many areas and the shortage of employment and training opportunities. The region needs to tackle these issues in order to create the conditions necessary to allow rural enterprise to flourish and to ensure a diverse and vibrant rural economy. Rural proposals will be expected to focus on needs and priorities in those areas designated as Rural Development Areas (see Annex 3) and that have been identified in the Rural Development Programme and other relevant local strategies. Where appropriate bids will need to show how they build on activities supported under the Rural Challenge Fund.\n\n23.   Education and skills development remains of key importance for the region. Short term priorities include: raising attainment at secondary school level; raising the skill levels of those in employment; development of key skills; and development of Information Technology skills. Ensuring that those leaving education are fully equipped with the skills and attitudes required by employers will be of key importance.These issues might be addressed through initiatives such as intensive work experience programmes and through further development of linkages between employers and education and training providers. Proposals will need to make clear how they meet the identified education and training needs of their particular locality, including any specific emerging skill shortages. Important areas for longer term investment include: pre-school and primary school developments; continuing development of basic skills and IT skills ; and the opening up of access facilities outside school hours, including summer school developments.\n\n24.   Bids will be expected to include measures to address crime reduction and demonstrate how they will link to local crime reduction and community safety strategies published by the statutory partnerships established under the Crime & Disorder Act. Elements which have often been overlooked in earlier rounds are victim support, preventing repeat victimisation and managing offenders/ex-offenders in the community. Bids should also consider how they will link with Youth Offending Teams which are to be established by local authorities under the Crime & Disorder Act.\n\n25.   The worst ward areas featuring in the Index of Local Deprivation are associated with poor housing conditions which are unlikely to be addressed by Housing Investment Programme and Capital Receipts Initiative resources alone. SRB strategies aimed at addressing multiple deprivation should not ignore the housing element and such bids should show how housing issues feed into the proposed plans for regeneration. Where appropriate , they should also take into account Government resources being made available through the New Deal for Communities.\n\n26.   The Regional Housing Framework for Yorkshire & the Humber identified eight key themes:\n\njoint working arrangements;\n\nhousing market analysis;\n\nhousing quality;\n\nunpopular housing\n\nplanning for growth;\n\nsupported housing;\n\nrural and remote housing; and\n\nspecial needs housing, including black and ethnic minorities.\n\nMost of these are inextricably linked to economic and social regeneration, and can only be addressed by local housing authorities working in partnership with mainstream service providers and regeneration agencies. It is increasingly accepted that there are some structural mismatches between supply and demand for some housing types and locations. Regeneration through demolition and (partial) replacement may be the most satisfactory option here, following rigorous option appraisal. The issue of homelessness will also need to be specifically addressed where appropriate.\n\n27.   Bidders will need to consider the impact of their proposals on the environment. In particular, the following issues should be taken into account:\n\ndealing with the legacy of derelict and contaminated land, particularly in former coalfield areas, and the need to avoid use of greenfield sites;\n\nencouraging greater use of walking, cycling and public transport and minimising the travel impacts of development, building on integrated transport strategies and land use planning;\n\nencouraging community involvement in the management of their local environment through the LA21 process;\n\nlooking at ways to manage waste better, through minimisation, recycling and utilisation schemes;\n\nsustaining and enhancing the character of local environments, whether built or natural.\n\n28.   Other issues which proposals should take into account include:\n\nThe contribution which sporting and cultural interests can make to regeneration strategies - particularly linked to quality of life objectives, to personal and community capacity building, and to improving educational achievements;\n\nLinks to the work of local Drug Action Teams and the implementation of the Government's 10 year strategy for tackling drug abuse (\"Tackling Drugs to Build a Safer Britain\", published April 1998);\n\nMeasures which support and strengthen families. Key themes include: support for parenting, support for families and children at risk, promoting volunteering, tackling social exclusion;\n\nAttention to good design - particularly \"Secure by Design\", a standard which is recognised and promoted by all four police forces in the region - and how good design can contribute to fire safety and prevention.\n\n Timetable and Decision Process\n29.   The full bidding timetable is set out in the SRB Round 5 Bidding Guidance. Key deadlines are:\n\n27 November 1998  - submission of expressions of interest to GOYH;\n\n30 April 1999           - submission of final bids to the RDA;\n\nJune 1999                 - bidders informed of decisions.\n\n30.   Expressions of interest should be submitted using the proforma as set out in the national Bidding Guidance. Those partnerships bidding for large scale funding for comprehensive schemes will be expected to supplement this with a \"first draft\" of the final bid to facilitate meaningful assessment and constructive dialogue. It is anticipated that the emerging RDA Shadow Board will be consulted on the merits of proposals at expressions of interest stage. This will take place mid-December 1998, with responses to partnerships and feedback meetings in January 1999. When formally established, the RDA Board will assess final bids and make recommendations to Ministers. (Further details of the RDA's address, SRB contact name, etc. will be provided before the final bidding stage.)\n\n31.   In order to limit the time and resources spent working up proposals with little prospect of financial support, those considering submissions must examine them critically to ensure they fully meet the requirements of the national Bidding Guidance and this Regional Framework. It will also be important for potential bidders to begin an early dialogue with GOYH and to work closely with the GO in the preparation of their bids. Any partnerships considering submitting a proposal who have not yet made contact with the Government Office should do so before 30 September 1998.\n\nContacts\n32.   We will continue to keep partnerships informed of policy developments.
