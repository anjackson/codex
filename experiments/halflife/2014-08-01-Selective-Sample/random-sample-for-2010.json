You can also have a Civil Partnership Ceremony in the Forest Suite at the Register Office to accompany the signing, although the Act does not require you to have a ceremony.\n\n\tTake a detailed virtual tour of the Register Office\n\tForest Suite at the Register Office for civil partnership ceremonies (optional)\n\tYou can make an appointment yourself using our online Register Office ebookings system\n\n\nThere are details of other venues in Waltham Forest further down this page. \n\nGiving notice\n\nIt is a legal requirement to give notice of your intention to register a civil partnership before you can sign the Register. We will then publicise your notices for fifteen days. A civil partnership notice states for each person:\n\n\tname and surname\n\tdate of birth\n\tcondition (this is your marital or civil partnership status)\n\toccupation\n\tnationality\n\tplace of formation (where you intend signing the Register)\n\n\nAfter giving notice, you must normally wait fifteen clear days before the civil partnership can be registered ? for example, if notice is given on 5 December, the registration can take place on or after 21 December. Once given, your notice is valid for 12 months. \n\nSpecial licence\n\nThis facility provides for a marriage or civil partnership to take place where one of the parties is terminally or seriously ill and not expected to recover, and therefore cannot be moved to a place where the marriage or civil partnership would normally take place.\n\n? More about Registrar General Special Licences (death bed)\n\nMinimum age\n\nThe minimum legal age for registering a civil partnership in England and Wales is 16 years of age but written consent may be required for anyone under 18.\n\nImmigration controls\n\nIf you are subject to immigration controls, you will have to give notice of your intention to register a civil partnership at a special designated office. You will need: \n\n\tto have an entry clearance granted expressly for the purpose of registering a civil partnership in the UK, \nor\n\tto have the written permission of the Home Secretary to register a civil partnership in the UK. This will take the form of a certificate of approval, which can be obtained from the Immigration and Nationality Department, \nor\n\tyou fall within a class of persons specified by the Home Secretary. This will be someone with settled status in the UK or former spouses whose marriage has been annulled.\n\n\nThese restrictions do not apply to foreign nationals who have been given the right of abode in the UK, or who are exempt from immigration controls because of their employment. \n\nAuthorised persons have a statutory duty to report any civil partnership they suspect has been registered for the sole purpose of evading statutory immigration controls.\n\nThere is more information on the General Register Office website, or you can contact the Register Office for more information. \n\n\n\nOther venues for civil partnerships and receptions\n\nYou may now choose to have a civil partnership ceremony in any Register Office in England and Wales or any approved civil partnership approved venue.

The Act allows same-sex couples who wish to have legal recognition of their partnership to sign the Register and have similar rights to married couples. \n\n\n\nMore information\n\nThere is a Civil Partnership explanatory document (PDF) for Waltham Forest.\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\nIf you want to make arrangements to sign the Register for a civil partnership, or have any questions about the Act, or would like more information, please contact Waltham Forest Register Office. ?\n\n?\n\nRelated websites\n\n\tForest Suite at the Register Office (optionally available for civil partnership ceremonies)\n\twww.civilceremonies.co.uk\n\twww.pinkweddings.biz\n\twww.stonewall.org.uk\n\n\n?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\tMain Menu\n\n\t\tHome\n\tLegal services\tRegister Office\tMarriages\tHistorical marriage searches\n\tBecoming an approved marriage/civil venue\n\tContact us\n\tForest Suite at the Register Office\n\tMarried - England and Wales\n\tMarriage - Outside of England and Wales\n\tMarriage - Immigration Control\n\tIntention to Marry\n\tSpecial licences for marriages and civil partnerships\n\tMarriage fees\n\tMarriage - Renew Vows\n\tMarriage - Civil Partnership\n\tMarriage - Housebound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLast updated on 13 January 2009\n\n\n\tHow useful was this page / information?\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\tNeighbouring councils??\n\tAbout this website??\n\tPrivacy policy??\n\tDisclaimer??\n\t?

          "Making DECISIONS Together in  \n A Common Life \n \n Through images and examples, the New Testament shows us how Christians are called to live out their faith together in community, including making decisions.   \n \n Acts describes four occasions when communal decision making takes place.   \n \n·\t Jesus’ followers come together in Jerusalem to decide on Judas Iscariot’s successor (Acts 1.14-26).   \n·\t There is the argument between Greek-speaking Jewish Christians and those Christians native to Jerusalem about the apparently discrimina tory way in which welfare was being distributed among the people (Acts 6.1-7).   \n·\t Luke mentions the disagreement concerning whether Gentiles who were ‘unclean’ could become Christians (11.1-18) and  \n·\t whether they should become Jews before being baptized as Christians (15.1-33).    \n \n A reliance on prayer, scripture and a sense of partnership with Jesus seem to have helped the Christian community remain unified throughout these disagreements. \n \n Some New Testament Guidelines  \n \n·\t Willingness to acknowledge one’s weaknesses and vulnerability and act with humility as a reflection of Christ’s nature (Phil.2.2-8). \n·\t Willingness, if necessary, to take risks and face the unpredictable. \n·\t Expectation that the Spirit will speak through everyone regardless of whether or nor they agree with one‘s viewpoint. \n·\t Willingness to respect and listen to the contributions of all. \n·\t Belief that God grants gifts to all people and that we can only function effectively within the Church with the help of fellow Christians (1 Cor. 12.12-27). \n·\t Confidence and trust that God has a vision for the Church (Eph. 5.17). \n·\t Dependence on the Holy Spirit’s guidance in seeking God’s vision for the way forward (Acts 15.28). \n \n \n Making Decisions in the Common Life – Some Principles \n \n All Churches make decisions \n \n Some  of these decisions are of direct ecumenical significance \n·\t Because they affect the lives of other Churches, or projects or arrangements which have been agreed ecumenically. \n \n Most – possibly all  – decisions are of indirect ecumenical signific ance \n·\t Because they may have an effect on the life, mission and ministry of some other part of the whole Church. \n \n All  decisions should be made with the awareness that they may have implications for other Churches. \n·\t This is essential when a Church and/or its leader has entered into a Covenant or other formal agreement with other churches and/or their leaders. \n \n All Churches need to make decisions within their own structures \n \n Those responsible for chairing or acting as secretary to a denominational decision-making body should ask themselves: \n \n·\t How will we know the ecumenical implications of our decisions? \n·\t Should we appoint a member of our decision-making body to have the specific role of alerting us to ecumenical implications? \n·\t Should we invite a member of our own church to be present at our meeting to alert us to ecumenical implications?   This may be an appropriate role for a denominational ecumenical officer. \n·\t Should we invite another Church to appoint a person to be present at our meetings? \n·\t Should we have an item at the end of every agenda in which we work out who needs to be informed about what? \n \n Be sure that you are clear about who needs to be informed about what. \n Do not assume that you know. \n \n A decision about a topic in one Church may not be made by the same person/group/committee in another Church even though a person may appear to have a similar role and a group/committee may have a similar (or even identical) name. \n \n Facilitate information sharing by establishing communication between those with similar roles in different Churches. \n \n Enable them to meet together, explain their roles to each other, share information with each other, report denominational decisions to e ach other. \n \n \t They may also need to meet for fellowship, prayer, mutual support etc \n \n Send observers to each other’s decision-making bodies. \n \n Make sure that the observers know what to do with the information about what they have observed. \n \n Some decisions can be made together \n \n Establish relationships and clear lines of communication before there are decisions to be made. \n \n Be clear about what decision is to be made. \n \n Be clear about whose responsibility it is actually to make the decision. \n \n Make sure that the people who meet to make the decision actually have the authority or influence within their own Church to enable the joint decision to be accepted there. \n \n For recurring matters (such as matters connected with the appointment of ministers  in Local Ecumenical Partnerships) establish procedures and follow them on all occasions. \n \n Do not let the importance of being flexible, or the necessity for speed, lead you into abandoning jointly agreed procedures. \n \n Communicate what has been jointly agreed. \n \n If Church Leaders, for instance, have agreed something among themselves, it will probably need to be communicated to others within their own Churches. \n \n Find ways of reflecting together on the significance for other Churches of what has been decided by one Church.  \n Making Decisions Together – Some Principles/Examples of Good Practice within Specific Contexts \n \n Within Partner Denominations \n Individuals or groups that exercise denominational oversight understand how that oversight i nteracts with that of those individuals (such as County Ecumenical Officer) or groups (such as a Sponsoring Body, Local Advisory Group or Staffing Consultative Group) that exercise ecumenical oversight. \n \n Within Intermediate Bodies \n Within the oversight of the Intermediate Body and linked to local ecumenical groupings, representatives of different traditions within a geographical area meet regularly to reflect on ecumenical progress and seek ways forward.  Particularly effective in c ases where mission in new housing areas is a concern. \n \n Within Local Ecumenical Groups \n The Constitution of a local ecumenical group (LEP, Churches Together group etc) contains clear and workable provisions for how the group is to carry out its own decision m aking (such as a Joint Church Council/Ecumenical Church Council) and also make denominational decisions when necessary.  Having made sure of the above, the provisions are carefully carried out. \n \n Within LEPs, there are clear and commonly agreed procedures established for the appointment of new ministers which will ensure ecumenical consultation, e.g. the Staffing Consultative Group.   \n \n Within Local Churches \n On regular occasions during the year, the decision-making bodies of local churches ensure that their representatives attend each other’s meetings or hold their meetings together.  \n \n O God, Holy and eternal Trinity, \n We pray for your Church in all the world. \n Sanctify its life; renew its worship; \n Empower its witness; heal its divisions; \n Make visible its unity. \n \n Lead us, with all our brothers and sisters, \n Toward communion in faith, life and witness \n So that, united in one body by the one Spirit, \n We may together witness to the perfect unity of your love.   \n\n"],

Its northern and eastern edges, though, were likely to have been well scouted and explored, with some features visible from Saxon-held territory being given Anglo-Saxon names such as Hengestesdun. It is noticeable that the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles firmly name “Hengestesdun”, rather than “the place that is called Hengestesdun”, as though it was a familiar place. It is surely also the case that no location so deep in unknown Cornish territory as the Callington Hingston Down could have been given a Saxon name at that time. Bearing that in mind, plus the comparative times and distances in travel between the Cornu-Viking force and Ecgberht’s army in mind (the latter to include the transport of the initial intelligence), we must be looking for a site much further to the east. Is there such a place?\n\n\n\nThe answer is yes. The trackway across Dartmoor from Plymouth to Exeter begins to descend from the moor close to Moretonhampstead and a mile east of that village is a hill spur bearing the name of Hingston Down. This spot lies ten miles from both Exeter and Crediton and both this site and the Cornish one were recorded as Hengesdon (presumably Old English hengestes dun or stallion’s hill) a few years either side of 1300. The Moretonhampstead Hingston Down is surely a far more likely location for Hengestesdun.\n\n\n\nIt does not, however, lend itself well to being the site of a pre-planned battle. It is, though, a perfect place for Ecgberht to have lain in wait, with his army concealed in the thickly wooded Teign valley, or in the spur valleys below the hill and then to have launched an ambush. On approaching from the southwest, the Cornish-Viking army would not have had a hope of catching a glimpse of them until it was too late. From Ecgberht’s point of view, had it gone wrong, retreat to Exeter would have been an easy option. For him, though, it didn’t go wrong. “He put to flight both the Wealas and the Danes”, evidently back across the wilds of Dartmoor where the West Saxon forces had more sense than to follow.\n\n\n\nThis proposal is perhaps the first time that the site of Hengestesdun has ever been questioned and, with so little to go on, the jury must remain out. The writer invites any comment or further suggestion on the subject. Other questions emerge from this whole event. Who acted as interpreters between the Celtic-speaking Cornish and their Nordic-speaking allies? Who carried the news to Ecgberht? I can offer no real suggestion to the first question. As far as the second is concerned, the Danish arrival and alliance might have been witnessed by a West Saxon fishing boat but perhaps a more likely suspect would be a priest who could have overheard the plans, and Canterbury was then appointing many Saxon priests to Cornish churches. It seems to have been the case that, during this period of history, both Celtic and Saxon priests could travel where they pleased without fear of molestation, in the same way that the bards of old were guaranteed safe passage throughout the kingdoms of Britain.\n\n\n\nThe scanty sources of this kind of historical information give us very little in the way of fact. Modern and recent historians, though, have seen fit to project those sources into flights of pure fantasy, and to present those fanciful conclusions as “fact”. This has especially been the case where early Cornish history is concerned and I hope to follow this article in a future issue with examples of this “twisted history” (or “twistory” as I call it).\n\n\n\nCraig Weatherhill 2007\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t \n\n                                     Kate Parker\n\t\tAbout the author:\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n<< Prev - Next\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t[ Back ]\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t© 2010 Cornish World Magazine - The Magazine of Cornwall\n\n\tweb development by a-connect\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n",

We could say that we are ready,\" he added.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\n\nXinhua via chinadaily.com.cn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvBulletin® v3.6.8, Copyright ©2000-2010, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd.\n\n\n\n",

          "JMBA2 - Biodiversity Records\nPublished on-line\nRub and move: barracudas (Sphyraena barracuda) use swimming turtles \nas scraping surfaces in the South-western Atlantic\n��� ������\nAlice Grossman*, Cristina Sazima and Ivan Sazima\n���\n* Projeto Tamar/ICMBio, Alameda Boldr�� s/no, 53990-000 Fernando de Noronha, Pernambuco, Brazil. Departamento de Biologia Animal, \n���\nUniversidade Estadual de Campinas, 13083-970 Campinas, S��o Paulo, Brazil. Museu de Zoologia, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, 13083-\n���\n970 Campinas, S��o Paulo, Brazil (retired and associated as voluntary researcher). Corresponding author, e-mail:isazima@gmail.com\nThe predaceous fish barracuda (Sphyraena barracuda) is recorded rubbing itself against the \ncarapace of moving hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) and green turtles (Chelonia mydas) at Fernando \nde Noronha Archipelago, off north-eastern Brazil. To scrape against such a rough surface is probably \nemployed by the fish to get rid of external parasites.\nKeywords: Sphyraenidae, parasites, comfort behaviour, Cheloniidae, rough surfaces, north-eastern \nBrazil\nSeveral fish species display the behaviour of scraping themselves against a sandy bottom, presumably \nto get rid of external parasites (Wicklund, 1969; DeLoach, 1999; our personal observations). Four \nspecies of jacks (Carangidae) are recorded to rub themselves against the body of requiem sharks \n(Carcharhinidae), whose abrasive skin would provide an adequately rough surface for this purpose. \nIn the Atlantic, Caranx crysos and C. ruber are recorded to display this behaviour towards the shark \nCarcharhinus galapagensis, and Elagatis bipinnulata rubs itself against the latter shark and C. falciformis \n(Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1955; Wicklund, 1969). In the Pacific, the jack Caranx melampygus is recorded to scrape \nagainst C. galapagensis and E. bipinnulata displays this behaviour towards Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos \n(Papastamatiou et al., 2007). To the best of our knowledge, no fish seems presently recorded to \nscrape this way on another marine animal aside from sharks. Here we record the barracuda Sphyraena \nbarracuda (Sphyraenidae) while rubbing itself against the carapace of two species of marine turtles, \nEretmochelys imbricata and Chelonia mydas (Cheloniidae) in South-western Atlantic.\nField observations were made at Fernando de Noronha Archipelago (03��50'S 32��15'W), an \noceanic group of islets off north-eastern Brazil, during studies on the natural history of reef fishes \nand sea turtles (e.g. Sazima et al., 2004; Grossman et al., 2006). All rubbing records were made at \nthe site known as Pedras Secas, where both turtle species and the barracudas are a common sight. \nAs the rubbing against turtles is apparently a fleeting and rarely recorded behaviour (our personal \nobservations), it was digitally photographed and videoed. Straight carapace length (SCL) of turtles \nand total length (TL) of the fish were estimated to the nearest 5 cm using as reference objects \nof known size close to the animals. Copies of the digital photographs and the video are on file at \nZUEC (Museu de Zoologia da Universidade Estadual de Campinas).\nMost of the time barracudas remained stationary, hovering at mid-water and occasionally darted \nafter a potential prey fish. The turtles moved over the area generally swimming close to the bottom \nand occasionally foraged on algal turf (green turtles) or sponges (hawksbills). On 20 March 2006 \na barracuda about 85 cm TL was recorded to follow (���shadow���) a swimming hawksbill, E. imbricata, \nabout 40 cm SCL and to twice rub its snout against the turtle���s carapace (Figure 1). Each rubbing \nFigure 1.

Photograph: Jo��o Paulo Krajewski..\nbout was very quick and the fish���s body arched fleetingly. While rubbing, the fish moved along the \ncarapace from the rear to the front of the turtle, thus making contact with the posterior edge of \nthe scutes. The fish withdrew afterwards, the whole episode lasting about 20 sec. On 8 August 2006 \na barracuda of the same size was recorded to shadow a green turtle, C. mydas, about 50 cm SCL \n(Figure ) and to once rub itself against the carapace, again moving from the rear to the head, the \nwhole episode lasting about 15 sec. In the middle of June 2008 three barracudas (about 75 cm TL) \nwere recorded to queue at the rear of a slowly swimming green turtle (about 65 cm SCL). The \nfirst barracuda rubbed its snout twice against the turtle���s carapace while the other two waited \ntheir turn. The behaviour displayed by the fish while scraping against the carapace was similar to \nthe two rubbing bouts described above. When the first fish withdrew, the second fish advanced \ntowards the turtle and almost touched it but the approach of a diver interrupted its behaviour \nand the two remaining fish withdrew. The whole episode, from the first fish rubbing twice to the \ninterruption by a diver and the withdrawing of the second fish lasted 27 sec. Similarly fleeting \ncontact seems habitual for jacks rubbing against sharks (Papastamatiou et al., 007), although a \ngroup of six bar jacks was recorded following a silky shark for about 15 min and rubbing against the \nshark periodically (Wicklund, 1969).\nLike sharks, sea turtles offer a rough surface for fishes to rub against and thus remove external \nparasites and/or diseased tissue. A barracuda photographed with three parasitic copepods attached \nto its snout (Figure 3) lends support to the suggestion that the fish rubs against turtles to remove \nJMBA2 - Biodiversity Records\nPublished on-line\n   Barracudas use swimming turtles as scraping surfaces     A. Grossman et al. 3\nthis noxious animal type. The scutes of the hawksbill are particularly well suited for this purpose, \nsince their posterior edge is free and thus has the potential to scrape away a larger and/or \nprominent parasite. Additionally, the carapace of a swimming turtle is a more convenient surface to \nrub against than a rock, for instance, as the torpedo-shaped barracudas display a somewhat limited \nmanoeuvrability.\nA cleaner role is ascribed to sharks against which jacks rub themselves (Papastamatiou et al., \n007) and, following this view, the same could be said about sea turtles. However, cleaners generally \ndisplay elaborate behaviours while interacting with their clients and their role in reef communities \nis a complex and mutualistic one (Bshary, 2003; Bshary et al., 2007; Grutter, 2005; Guimar��es \net al., 007). Therefore, the concept of cleaning symbiosis can hardly be applied to a shark or a \nturtle against which a fish merely rubs itself. Thus, sharks and sea turtles would best be viewed as \nconvenient coarse surfaces roughly equivalent to sandy or rocky bottoms fishes use to presumably \nget rid of external parasites, although a fish that rubs itself against swimming turtles and sharks must \nadjust its speed and rubbing behaviour according to the moving animal.\nFurther studies in the archipelago may indicate whether barracudas rubbing against moving \nturtles is a localised or a more widespread behaviour. Although there are sites in the archipelago \nwhere turtles forage and interact with several reef fishes (e.g. Sazima et al., 2004; Grossman et al., \n2006) and barracudas occur there as well (our personal observations), at these sites we recorded \nno barracudas rubbing themselves against turtles or even approaching them.\nWe thank Jos�� Martins Silva Jr (Centro Golfinho Rotador) for logistic support; Zaira Matheus for the \nphotographs of barracudas with turtles; Jo��o Paulo Krajewski for the photograph of the barracuda���s head \nand valuable suggestions on the manuscript; Leonora (Lola) Fritzche for the video sequence; the ICMBio for \npermission to study fishes in the National Marine Park of Fernando de Noronha; the CNPq and FAPESP for \nessential financial support.\nREFERENCES\nBshary, R., 003.

Spencer's berating of her eldest daughter you would think she was the only Spencer with skeletons in the closet.  All three of her children had addictions that put them into debt.  Georgiana and Harriet had obscene debts due to their gambling addiction and George's debts pertained to his addiction to books!  Of course the Goddess of Wisdom, Lady Spencer herself, was no innocent, she herself, suffered from a gambling addiction making her no stranger to debt as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nHeather

September 21, 2010\n\n\n\n\nGeorge Stubbs Equestrian Portraits\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is perhaps one thing that comes to mind with the mention of the artist George Stubbs which would be the horse.  Like Monet with his flowers, Stubbs' had a fascination with his four-legged muses, and he was in good company.  Many aristocrats (the same people who commissioned his paintings) shared Stubbs' love of horses and requested their prize stallions and mares be immortalized.  Anyone who has visited the National Gallery in London can't miss Stubbs' portrait of Whistlejacket, the Marquess of Rockingham's prized racehorse, painted against a neutral background in order to not take away from the beauty of the horse.  The painting is placed at the end of the gallery so you see it from far away, adding more majesty to the stallion and more credit to Stubbs' talent.\n\n\n\nStubb's talent was not limited to horses, or even the many cherished pets he portrayed.  Overall, he was fantastic at portraying nature and his sitters' relationship to nature.  Those who commissioned Stubbs for portraits were the aristocrats who tended to trade city life and the gaming tables for their majestic country estates.  Portraits of sitters riding about their property do two essential things: prove the sitter is in touch with nature and display their wealth by portraying their ability to own thoroughbreds and large vasts of land. \n\n\n\n\t\n\tJoseph Smyth Esquire, Lieutenant of Whittlebury Forest, Northamptonshire, on a Dapple Grey Horse, c.1762-64\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tCountess of Conings by Livery of Charlton, c1760\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tLaetitia, Lady Lade, 1793\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tJohn and Sophia Musters riding at Colwick Hall, 1777  \n\n\n\t\n\tWilliam Anderson with Two Saddle-Horses, 1793\n\n\n\t\n\tBaron De Robeck Riding A Bay Hunter, 1791\n\n\n\t\n\tSelf-Portrait, 1782\n\n\n\nStubbs' lack of formal training adds a sense of folk art to the portrayals which make them all the more charming and appropriate to hang in those country homes.  Although there is a sense of portraying the animal perfectly, which is lost on other aspects of the painting, that same painstaking skill is used in rendering the sitter's face.  The true joy of painting can be seen in the background, in which Stubbs used a whole different technique in order to capture the landscape.  His ability to capture all these varying elements easily transforms viewers into the work. I particularly enjoy his equestrian portraits because you feel as if you could just ride away into the painting with the sitters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nHeather Carroll\n\n\nat\n00:01\n\n\n11\ncomments\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\nArt,\nGeorge Stubbs,\nHorses and Racing,\nPaintings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonday, September 20, 2010\n\n\n\n\nPop Up Video- Walking on Broken Glass\n\n\n\n\n\nI've written before about my love of a good 18th century themed music video.  It takes a great diva like Annie Lennox to do our century proud.  The younger audience may not be familiar with Pop-Up Video which delivered great trivia while watching music videos; it personally made me undefeatable at Rock and Roll Jeopardy when that was still on.\n\n\n\nThe good people at Spin the Bottle have many of these pop-up classics, and we can thank them for the video below which contains both the amazing Walking on Broken Glass video and the fun trivia that goes with it.  I was surprised there was no mention of Hugh Laurie which shows America's general ignorance to his existence in the mid-90's.  Enjoy, and learn something in the process!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nHeather Carroll\n\n\nat\n00:01\n\n\n7\ncomments\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n18th C Nerdom,\nJust for Fun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday, September 19, 2010\n\n\n\n\nYay or Nay?

The Silent Treatment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe end of 1786 was a rough time for Georgiana.  In Autumn she suffered from spasms, which may of had something to do with her bad health later in life.  Lady Spencer arrived to nurse her daughter and Bess took it upon herself to take Georgiana's place and order around the servants who raised eyebrows at her.  When Lady Spencer reported Bess' behavior Georgiana refused to believe her mother.\n\n\n\nAfter Georgiana's health returned she confessed some of her debts to her husband who flew into a rage (I would be upset too if I found out my spouse had the modern equivalent of a $6 million gambling debt) and screamed for a separation. Georgiana was reasonably upset and turned to her best friend for support.\n\n\n\nFor whatever reason, though, Bess gave Georgiana no shoulder to cry on.  In fact she refused to talk to her altogether!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nHeather Carroll\n\n\nat\n00:01\n\n\n5\ncomments\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\nBess Foster,\nDebt,\nGeorgiana Duchess of Devonshire,\nOh no She Didn't\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonday, September 13, 2010\n\n\n\n\nThe Tyranny of Beauty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor anyone lucky enough to be in glorious Paris from now until 23 October you must check out a contemporary exhibit.  Yes, contemporary!  Jean-Charles de Castelbajac's newest show, The Tyranny of Beauty feature's some of our favourite Gainsboroughs, including an appearance by Her Grace, herself and her good friend, Little Po.\n\n\n\nCastelbajac combines the images of famous art historical works with recognizable graphics from our contemporary culture.  The historical images are not prints but actually the oil copies of paintings that you can purchase from China (here is an example).  By devaluing the artwork by reproducing it so easily, Castelbajac adds further degradation by adding commercial imagery.  Here is a snippet from the artist statement:\n\nThe tyranny in question is that of an insatiable need to please, of youth's domination, of a quest for immortality and of the denial of time past.\n\nCastelbajac adds trait, logo, sign or brand obliteration to classic master paintings. As if creams, capsules or other artifices could open up a path to eternal youth and stamp their radiant faces with indelible copyrights.\nThe exhibition sounds like a delight, I only wish I could finagle an impromptu trip to Paris.  Many thanks to Fabultastic for keeping me up to date on the exhibit.\n\n\n\nFurther images of the exhibit from TrendLand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nHeather Carroll\n\n\nat\n00:01\n\n\n7\ncomments\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\nArt,\nMuseums and Exhibitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday, September 12, 2010\n\n\n\n\nYay or Nay?

Let's go, let's go!).  It wasn't only a love for pups that Georgiana had in common with Lady Salisbury, they were both big gamblers and consequently both in large amounts of debt.  Lady Salisbury led the Tory women in canvassing during the 1784 Westminster election, but didn't receive nearly as much press as Georgiana's campaign. In fact, after reading about Lady Salisbury canvassing in March of that year Lady Spencer sent her daughters on mission to outdo the countess.  This would be the same Lady Spencer who begged her two daughters to stop their canvassing a mere two months later.\n\n\n\nUnlike Georgiana, Lady Salisbury lived to a ripe old age.  Madame Guillotine has a fabulous post on her life which you should most certainly check out here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nHeather Carroll\n\n\nat\n23:25\n\n\n0\ncomments\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\nMary Countess of Salisbury,\nTories,\nWestminster Election of 1784\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWednesday, September 8, 2010\n\n\n\n\nHis Highness Goes Revolutionary on Us\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's made it to the top ten and now our favourite fop put together a show meant to tug on America's heartstrings!  Enjoy and cross your fingers for his victory!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou only know if he makes it to the grand showdown he'll bring new meaning to Rococo.

She recommended picking out some new wallpaper.\n\n\n\n\nWhen Frederick was born Bess wrote again to her mother describing the horrors of labor.\n\nLady Bristol, having gone through the ordeal of labor seven times over, once again had little sympathy for the over-dramatization of the process and asked Bess to reflect more on the joys of motherhood rather than complain about the toils of the labor.\n\n\n\nAfter a month of laying in, Bess was re-released to the world and all she could do was roll her eyes at it.  First she remarked on how she found all babies \"much alike\" and then bemoaned how her son was \"dependent\" on her.  Not being a mother myself, I noticed two-month-olds tend to do that.  One has to wonder how much mothering Bess was actually doing seeing as she had a wet nurse.  \n\n\n\nIt wasn't only Bess' son which bored her but now Dublin seemed just as odious as Dunleer.  While many contemporary accounts rave about Dublin's ability to be a thoroughly diverting metropolis Bess wrote, \"je m'ennuie Ã  la mort\"  [I am bored to death].  Besides finding the city \"dirty\" and \"dull\" she found the women \"ill educated & indelicate.\"  But perhaps Bess' real beef with Dublin was the fact that her flirting wasn't reciprocated.  According to Bess the men were \"too much engrossed by Politicks to engage much in society...\"\n\n\n\nSeason 2\n\n\t\n\tLady Bristol was quick to tell Bess to stop complaining\t\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Bess was three months pregnant with her son, Augustus she had enough of her boring life and ran away.  She then met up with a Mr. Churchill and attempted absconding to Scotland with him.  One has to wonder if Bess was so bored by Dublin if Scotland would have been much better? In any case she never would reach the amusements of Scotland for her husband caught her in York.\n\n\n\nThe year was now 1782 and Bess was staying in Bath with her sister, Mary.  Both ladies were poor, separated from their husbands, and ostracized from public (I bet Dunleer wasn't looking too bad anymore!).  It was here where Bess was to be introduced to the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire who befriended the two fallen women.  However, Bess only too easily left her sister in the dust when the Devonshires invited her to accompany them out of Bath. Bess' sob story of her lost children had pulled on their heartstrings more than Mary's, whose child had been allowed to stay with her after the separation.\n\n\n\nThe truth of the matter is, Bess only really experienced being a \"teen mom,\" for by the time she was in her twenties her husband had custody of her two sons, whom she wouldn't see for another fourteen years.  Her other children (Caroline and Clifford) were illegitimate offspring of the Duke and were also raised more by others than by Bess.  Bess would find that she appreciated being a mother only when the ability was taken away from her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nHeather Carroll\n\n\nat\n00:01\n\n\n16\ncomments\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\nBess Foster,\nChildren,\nElizabeth Hervey Countess of Bristol,\nIreland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonday, September 6, 2010\n\n\n\n\nGossipy Charms\n\n\n\n\n\nThe newest strain on my wallet has been Juicy Couture's adorable charm bracelets.  I fear I've exposed Lauren to my addiction as well, but that is what friends are for!  They have such a unique and fun collection; you can put together a bracelet fit for a queen or duchess.  In my shopping sessions I have noticed charms fit for an 18th century gossip girl: dice, cakes, ducal coronets, and fans.  Perhaps one of the charms will bring me good luck on the faro table!  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuicy Couture Charm Set: 18th Century Gossip by GeorgianaGossip featuring a pearl pendant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nHeather Carroll\n\n\nat\n00:01\n\n\n9\ncomments\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\nFor Sale,\nJewelery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday, September 5, 2010\n\n\n\n\nYay or Nay?

Binge drinking and heavy alcohol use puts young people at serious risk â€“ from injuries, fights, regretted sexual activity and substance misuse; and,   \n\tIf parents use alcohol responsibly, it is more likely their children will too. Parents and carers can protect children from misusing alcohol by maintaining a close relationship with their children, setting clear rules about alcohol and supervising their children's drinking. \n\n  \n  A public awareness campaign will begin next month to raise awareness of the dangers of young people's alcohol consumption to reduce the impact on individuals, families and society.   \nA video booth will be available on the Assembly Government stand at the Urdd Eisteddfod to gauge young people's views on alcohol. The views gathered will help inform the development of campaigns to tackle alcohol misuse in young people.   \n\n  Dr Jewell said: \"Evidence shows that the younger people start drinking, the greater the impact on their health and well-being in the long term.   \n\"We know that children are under a lot of peer pressure particularly in their teenage years, and may find it difficult not to go along with their friends who may drink or smoke. But it is essential that we all take responsibility for setting a good example to young people to minimise this.   \n\"Not only is there a clear immediate and long term impact on health of alcohol misuse, there is the potential for young people to be at risk of being involved in anti-social behaviour, crime, unwanted pregnancies or drugs.   \n\"The cost to the NHS in Wales alone of treating alcohol-related health problems currently stands between Â£70-85million a year. If we do not tackle this problem, the financial cost in the future will be significantly higher.   \n\"I am not trying to preach to people with this new guidance. I aim to simply set out the facts to help parents and young people make informed choices. Ultimately, it is a matter for individuals if they take this advice on board.\"   \n\n  Health Minister Edwina Hart added: \"Alcohol misuse damages the health of individuals, damages families through alcohol-related domestic abuse and inflicts crime and anti-social behaviour on communities.   \n\"I welcome the new guidance from the Chief Medical Officer. While we are taking action to improve education, prevention and treatment, the main levers to make the most significant change remain with the UK Government through the power to legislate on price, licensing and advertising.   \n\"I will work with the UK Government on this but if it does not take action soon, I will seek the powers to act ourselves.   \n\"I welcome that the new UK Government has already indicated that it will review the licensing laws and that it will end the promotions on alcohol as this will help to reduce the binge drinking culture.\"   \nBMA Cymru Wales' Welsh Secretary Dr Richard Lewis, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales fully support this new guidance. \n\n\"Children under fifteen are still developing their brains, and drinking alcohol can do severe damage and have long lasting consequences. \n\n\"Young people who binge drink in adolescence are also more likely to become binge drinkers as adults, and have an increased risk of developing alcohol dependence. \n\n\"Unless we combat the heavy drinking culture which has developed amongst young people, we are more likely to see increasing numbers of people with serious liver disease at a younger age in years to come. \n\n\"We advocate an integrated approach to tackling alcohol misuse. These guidelines need to be supported by a crackdown on shops that sell alcohol to underage children, and some form of minimum pricing.\"   \nAndrew Misell, from Alcohol Concern Wales said: \"An alcohol- free childhood is the ideal for all children, as evidence shows it will delay the age of first drinking and reduce potential harms.   \n\"All of us as adults need to set the right example so that children can learn how to treat alcohol responsibly. We also need to ensure children aren't tempted to buy or get hold of cheap alcohol and the easiest way to do this would be to introduce a minimum price for alcohol.\"\nReport: \n\nYou, your child and alcohol  \n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t[ Back to top \n\t | Home\n\t| Accessibility \n\t| Feedback \n\t| Directory \n\t| Copyright Notice \n\t| Terms Of Use \n\t| Site Index\n\t| Cymraeg ]\n\n\t \n",

Lee was a painter of landscapes and pastoral scenes, influenced by John Constable's work. He often collaborated with Thomas Sidney Cooper and Sir Edwin Landseer. As with these two paintings, Lee created the landscape and another artist added the animals.\n\n\nMany of Cooper's paintings derived their inspiration from Landseer. The commentator Mrs Adams-Acton complained that he was 'eternally painting the cows lying down in his meadows, stolidly chewing the cud, and selling these pictures for enormous prices, and after all, when you have once mastered the technique, there is very little drawing required in a cow.'\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t Home :\n\t\t\t    Museum Home :\n\t\t\t    RPSGB Home :\n\t\t\t    Tate\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t  \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t",

This document sets out the Freight Transport Association’s (hereafter referred to as FTA) response to the current inquiry entitled \"Trunk Roads and Casualty Reduction” held by the Enterprise and Learning Committee of the National Assembly for Wales. FTA has limited its comments to those which have a direct relevance to logistics and supply chain operations.\n\nFreight Transport Association\n\n2. FTA represents the logistics and supply chain interests of businesses throughout the United Kingdom. Its membership includes large blue chip multinational companies, major third party logistics providers, own account operators which carry their own goods, and small to medium sized hauliers. FTA has in excess of 14,000 members who between them operate over 200,000 heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) accounting for approximately half the UK fleet. In addition, FTA members consign 90% of freight moved by rail and 70% of goods shipped by sea and air. This unique multi modal mandate enables FTA to speak authoritatively on all aspects of logistics based on the broader transport needs of the economy.\n\nBackground\n\n3. Good progress is being made in road traffic accident reduction in the UK and the Government appears to be on course to meet its targets for reducing the number of people killed or seriously injured in road accidents by 40% in 2010 compared to the baseline period of 1994 - 98. It is a source of concern to FTA that the Welsh Transport Statistics 2008 Road Safety chapter does not contain details of the number of HGVs and LGVs involved in accidents on Welsh roads. Such information would enable both industry and Government to make a more effective diagnosis of road safety in Wales.  In addition, the frequency of accidents is falling for all road user groups - whether measuring slight accidents or those in which someone is killed or seriously injured. Factors influencing this reduction include vehicle design and safety features, traffic management and road user behaviour.\n\n4. For HGV operators, appropriate road safety policy makes good business sense. Minimising the number of accidents and their severity means costly downtime linked to vehicles and drivers being off the road can be minimised. The Department for Transport’s (DfT) publication \"Road Casualties Great Britain 2007: Annual Report” (published 25th September 2008), reviewed the main trends in road accident casualties. In 2007, Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) and Light Goods Vehicles (LGVs) achieved significant reductions in the rate of serious and fatal accidents, despite an overall increase in traffic for goods vehicles over that time period. \n\n5. In 2007, the rate of accidents involving HGVs where people sustained injuries of all severities was 36 per 100 million vehicle kilometres. This is a reduction of 7.7% from the previous year and a decrease of one third since 1997. The rate of accidents involving LGVs was 21 (per 100 million vehicle kilometres) representing a reduction of 12.5% since 2006 and is half the rate it was 10 years ago. These accident rates are far below the rate for \"All Motor Vehicles” in 2007 (see Table 1 below)\n\nTable 1: Accident rate per 100 million vehicle kilometres \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1997\n\t2006\n\t2007\n\t% change on 1997\n\t% change on 2006\n\n\tHGVs\n\t54\n\t39\n\t36\n\t-33%\n\t-7.7%\n\n\tLGVs\n\t41\n\t24\n\t21\n\t-49%\n\t-12.5%\n\n\tCars\n\t93\n\t67\n\t63\n\t-32%\n\t-6.0%\n\n\tAll Motor Vehicles\n\t92\n\t65\n\t62\n\t-33%\n\t-4.6%\n\n\n\n\t\t\n6. Due to the size and weight of HGVs, they tend to be involved in more severe accidents. In 2007 the rate of fatal accidents was higher for HGVs (1.6 per 100 million vkm) than for all motor vehicles (0.9 per 100 million vkm). LGVs however had the lowest fatal accident rate of all vehicle types (0.4 per million vkm). \n\nTable 2. Number of vans and hgvs involved in accidents*\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLight Goods\n\tHeavy Goods\n\tAll motor vehicles\n\n\tMotorways\n\t1142\n\t2,320\n\t17,707\n\n\tA roads\n\t6,907\n\t5,676\n\t148,091\n\n\tB roads\n\t1,713\n\t884\n\t39,794\n\n\tOther\n\t4,858\n\t1,808\n\t112,417\n\n\n\n\t\t\n* accidents of all severities\n\n7. Latest figures published by Accident Exchange found that non UK registered lorries were the 'at fault’ party for one in every 378 traffic accidents, which has risen 10 per cent from March 2008 to the end of February 2009. These findings are based on an analysis of 115,000 incidents and Accident Exchange also estimate that overseas lorries were involved in 9,000 accidents a year. Sideswiping is the biggest cause of foreign vehicle accidents where the vehicles pull out to overtake unaware of vehicles on their blind side, despite the Department for Transport providing 200,000 Fresnel lenses to foreign lorry drivers over the past year.\n\n8. According to the Association of British Insurers, mile for mile, foreign lorries are three time more likely to be involved in collisions than their UK counterparts.\n\nPriorities For Logistics Industry And National Assembly For Wales\n\n9. When considering any further targets for casualty reduction, FTA believes that any future targets should continue to be generic in their application to road users and that professional drivers should not be singled out as a target group in order to deliver an \"easy win”. The logistics / supply chain sector has made significant improvements in its accident record and the National Assembly for Wales should build on these initiatives through:-\n\nTargeted Enforcement\n\n10. Enforcement authorities should focus their activities against those operators with the poorest safety record. Companies that have an established culture of safety and compliance should benefit from lighter touch enforcement. VOSA’s Operator Compliance Risk Score which has been specifically established for goods vehicle operators, provides a sound basis to separating the compliant operators from the non - compliant. FTA believes that in order to improve trunk road safety in Wales, the enforcement authorities need to focus their approach on the non - compliant operators, both UK and non UK. The introduction of Graduated Fixed Penalties will go some way to achieving a safe trunk road network in Wales.\n\nSafety Best Practice\n\n11. Early adopters of safety best practice should be encouraged and supported, where appropriate, through vehicle grants. Examples of vehicle safety features which should be encouraged include:-\n\n\tElectronic vehicle stability control;\n\tImproved vehicle lighting or fitment of reflective tape for enhanced visibility at night; and\n\tFront and rear underrun and sideguards that go beyond legal requirements.\n\n\nRoad Safety Education\n\n12. Education aimed at raising safety consciousness and initiatives to modify behaviour should be targeted at vulnerable groups and situations where the risk of accidents is high should be the main targets. Issues of particular relevance to HGVs include:-\n\n\tCyclists and how to behave around goods vehicles (e.g. positioning at red traffic lights, anticipating HGV manoeuvres at left hand turns, being seen at night / in times where visibility is poor, etc ….); Appendix 1 provides details of best practice employed by Cemex UK Ltd in relation to HGVs and cyclists which is being rolled out to other operators.\n\tInclusion of \"awareness of trucks” in the Highway Code and how motorists should manoeuvre and position themselves on the road with HGVs in mind (e.g. awareness of HGV cut - ins at roundabouts and rear view limitations for goods vehicles, etc ….);\n\tAdditional information to be included in the driving test on motorway / trunk road driving. This could include incorporation of a safe practice for overtaking lorries (i.e. don’t sit alongside lorries travelling at the same speed and either stay behind in the mirror’s view or overtake in a safe manner); and\n\tThe EU’s Driver CPC qualification is an ongoing training programme requiring professional drivers to undertake 35 hours of training over 5 years. A key element to the Driver CPC syllabus is road safety.\n\n\nIndustry Initiatives\n\n13. The logistics industry is fully aware that it too has a role to play in casualty reduction and has already taken steps to address this issue:-\n\n\tUse of \"Well Driven?” as a code of practice for professional drivers and a mechanism for other motorists to feedback positive and negative experiences of HGV driving;\n\tDevelopment of industry accident benchmarking initiatives as a mechanism for individual companies to identify opportunities for improvement and report performance in a consistent way as a corporate social responsibility indicator;\n\tUse of accident monitoring / accident records used as a KPI in driver reward;\n\tIncorporation into wider workplace transport safety policies and procedures; and\n\tAwareness raising by the industry for other road users - such as \"If you can’t see my mirrors then I can’t see you” stickers on the rear of HGVs.\n\n\nInfrastructure Improvements\n\n14. FTA understands that there is in place a Trunk Road Forward Programme in order to improve the overall road transport infrastructure in Wales. FTA believes that the programme could be \"speeded up” in order to reduce the number of accidents currently occurring on Trunk Roads in Wales. As part of this process, the Welsh Assembly Government should give consideration to the introduction of \"crawler lanes” on steep, uphill climbs to allow the safe overtaking of HGVs.\n\n15. Linked to this, EU drivers’ hours rules require that drivers stop for regular rest breaks and not drive for more than 4.5 hours at any one stretch on the grounds of road safety. In recent years, a number of dedicated truck parking areas and laybys used regularly by trucks have closed. Reduced availability of driver facilities have impacted upon operations with operators experiencing difficulty with adhering to legally required drivers’ hours rules on breaks when drivers have nowhere to stop and take the required breaks.\n\n16. FTA believes that the National Assembly for Wales should develop a coherent strategy for driver facilities and that the responsible highways authority provides regularly spaced facilities for HGV drivers on major freight routes (e.g. A55).\n\nConclusion\n\n17. Statistically, the UK has the best safety record in Europe, and British registered HGVs are the safest vehicles on our roads. However, FTA maintains that the safety of all road users is of paramount importance and that the logistics industry has a key role to play in ensuring that the UK remains at the forefront in terms of road safety. The National Assembly for Wales also has a key role to play in ensuring that not only is the status quo maintained in terms of its road safety record, but that the priorities outlined above are taken forward and implemented in a positive manner so that further improvements can be made.\n\nAppendix 1 - Cemex Uk Ltd Case Study\n\nEvery year in this country, over 15,000 cyclists have been involved in road accidents, including 2,300 who are seriously injured or killed. These numbers are only the ones which are reported. In relation to these accidents, further analysis shows that:-\n\n\t90% occur in urban areas;\n\t75% happen at, or near, a road junction;\n\t80% occur in daylight;\n\t80% of cyclist casualties are male;\n\tApproximately one third of the cyclists killed or injured are children; and\n\tAround three quarters of cyclists killed have major head injuries\n\n\nFollowing a number of incidents that involved Cemex vehicles and cyclists, resulting in 4 fatalities and 6 serious injuries between 1991 and 2004, a major safety initiative was launched. Investigations were undertaken into the driver’s field of vision on vehicles operated by the company. The research showed that there was a particular risk of incidents at road junctions, where cyclists are on the nearside of vehicles turning left. The initiative that was developed on the back of these findings had many facets to improve not only the safety specification of haulage vehicles, but also the awareness of drivers and cyclists to potential risk.\n\nAn early initiative implemented by Cemex was to fit all vehicles with reversing bleepers to warn pedestrians and construction site staff that the vehicle is making a reverse manoeuvre. In addition, all vehicles were fitted with reversing cameras to work as an aid for the driver when making such manoeuvres. Following this, additional nearside mirrors have been fitted to all truckmixers, cement tankers and tipper vehicles owned by Cemex or operated by contractors in company livery within the UK. This initiative is now being rolled out across Cemex Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia and will encompass in excess of 5,000 vehicles. Publicity campaigns are also being developed to encourage other operators contracted to Cemex in the UK to fit such mirrors.\n\nCemex are also developing further initiatives. Nearside cyclist warning signs are being fitted to the rear nearside corner of all haulage vehicles warning cyclists of the danger of passing along the inside of vehicles. These signs have now been adopted by several other organisations within the construction and building materials sector. Additional \"Caution! Keep Clear” signs have been fitted to the nearside of cement mixer vehicles operating in London. \n\nTruckmixers and tippers operating in London have also been fitted with proximity sensors on the nearside. These are operational when the left turn indicator is activated and give a verbal warning to cyclists should they attempt to pass on the nearside and an audible alarm will sound in the cab for the driver. \n\nCemex has also entered into partnership with the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) in producing a film entitled \"Cyclists and Lorries” along with an associated factsheet. Company open days have also been held with employees and members of the public invited to sit in the cab to get the \"driver’s view”.   \n\n\n\n\t\n \n\n\tback to document list\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t        \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n            \n\t\t\t\tWelsh Assembly Government|Accessibility|Help|Site map|Privacy Policy|Terms & Conditions \n            \n\n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n        \n       \n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n        \t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n",

More than anything else, they will have been impressed by the warmth of the welcome that the report received from crofting organisations and several individual crofters whom the minister and I visited after the event.\n\n\n\nIt is important to emphasise, as other members have, why crofting matters. In case anyone in Parliament is wondering, perhaps understandably, why crofting needs to be so regulated, it is no exaggeration to say that if crofting were not regulated, it would probably not now exist. Indeed, had the crofting acts from 1886 onwards not been passed, it is seriously questionable whether constituencies such as mine would now have any viable populations at all.\nIs crofting still necessary? Does it demand our attention and our parliamentary time? The answer to both those questions is definitely yes. As Mark Shucksmith emphasises, although crofting is in a fairly fragile - let us be honest, precarious - position at present, its continued existence in some form is essential. It is essential if we are to maintain any population working on the land in the Highlands and Islands, if we are to maintain Gaelic-speaking communities and if we are to promote the social and economic development of rural Scotland.\nThere are undoubted environmental benefits to crofting as well. To take one example, the unique landscape of the Uists and the varied bird life that it sustains would not exist if it was not grazed and unless hay was made there in something like the traditional way. The minister will be waiting for me to make my customary plea for the greylag goose population in Uist to be controlled to achieve those ends. I hope that I have not disappointed him.\nMany have used the word \"radical\" to describe the report - and justifiably so. In recommending the abolition of the Crofters Commission the report recognises that crofters want and need a much greater sense of ownership over the structures that regulate their way of life. I hope that we will take the opportunity to introduce a much-needed element of democracy into the process. As others have said, the separation of regulation from the development functions will be useful in that respect. The strengthening of common grazings committees will also be welcomed in the crofting community.\nPerhaps the most immediate impact would come from the implementation of the recommendation that the rights given to individuals in the Crofters Holdings (Scotland) Act 1886 should extend only to those living reasonably locally and using the land beneficially. That recommendation has the potential to go a long way towards tackling multiple problems. If we do it right and implement the recommendation sympathetically, we could cut back on the number of derelict or unworked crofts, making things easier for new entrants, and we could end the speculation in croft land for house building.\nShucksmith's proposals to enhance the croft house grant scheme and to permit house building by crofters without the need to decroft are extremely useful. Those proposals will be appreciated, not least in areas where there is on-going friction between the need to provide houses - affordable ones, I hope�??and the temptation to build on the most viable crofting land. I hope that communities will seek imaginative ways out of that tension by promoting building, where possible, on common grazings rather than croft land.\nAbove all else, Professor Shucksmith is to be congratulated on seeking to bring some simplicity to a massively complicated area of Scots law. It is an area so complicated that only a handful of lawyers in private practice now specialise enough to know their way through it entirely. The old adage that a croft is a small piece of land surrounded by legislation is quoted to death, but it is nonetheless true. A century and more of laws have been allowed to build up like the layers of paint on the Forth rail bridge. Add to that the byzantine complexities of European Union agricultural regulation and throw in a few bits of ancient Norse law, and we have a massive disincentive for any potential new crofter.\nI hope that we will be bold enough, however we legislate, to simplify rather than complicate as we respond as a Parliament to the report. Elements of important detail will certainly give rise to debates. \nFor instance, the future of the Government's bull hire scheme, which others have mentioned, continues to concern many in my constituency, and there are genuine questions about the viability and availability of commercial alternatives in many areas.\nIt is also important that we avoid further cluttering our - at first sight - uncluttered Highland landscape. That will mean entering into genuine discussions to ensure that any new structures do not duplicate the functions of community landlords, many of which rightly see development as a key part of their role. There is also the issue of community land buyouts. In the past, buyouts involving private landlords perhaps proved simpler than buyouts involving the man who was recently described as the biggest landlord in Scotland�??the minister. I do not think I am testing parliamentary privilege to the utmost if I mention that one landlord who was rightly bought out in a community land buyout is now languishing in an Australian jail for a serious crime. It would appear that greater complications are involved in buying out Mike Russell -I hope that the representatives from the west side of Harris who are here today and who will meet the minister will be able to make progress on that.\nThe crofting community is clearly enthused by what it has heard from Professor Shucksmith. The Parliament has passed far-sighted legislation on crofting and land reform in the past and, as one or two members have mentioned, it has also wisely avoided bad legislation. Crofters are clearly looking to us as a Parliament to respond, as legislation is undoubtedly now required. I hope that the ideas in the Shucksmith report, which was commissioned by the previous Executive but presented to the new Government, can command cross-party support. Crofters certainly deserve that.\nThe full text of the debate can be found at http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-08/sor0515-02.htm#Col8620\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Updated ( 16/05/2008 )\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t�\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t< Prev\n\t\t\t\t\t\t�\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNext >\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t[ Back ]\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t \n\t \n\t \n\n\t \n\n\n",

When Jacob's re-introduced their original wrapping system for the Club biscuit earlier this year we were over joyed, as they lend themselves well to small origami animals. We have taken this as a gesture of goodwill and ended our embargo on Club biscuit matters. You can find out more in this weeks biscuit of the week.\n\nPerhaps you do something with biscuit wrappers other than chuck them in the bin! If so let us know we may even come up with a new icon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tHoliday romance\n\n\t\t\n\nIts a familiar story old as time itself, the holiday romance. Boy meets foreign biscuit, boy buy's foreign biscuit then brings it home to meet his mates, who not wearing the same rose tinted holiday glasses pour scorn and mockery upon the unfortunate packet.\n\nThe Guild of Biscuiteers (East Mids Sector) has sent us in this guest biscuit review, complete with pictures, which perfectly captures that Euro biscuit disappointment. Check out our guest review page for this Portuguese Maria Oro review, it will be very familiar to any of you who have carted home Euro biscuits keen to learn about the culture of others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tDid the Dinosaurs drink tea, or maybe were wiped out by some sort of tea related catastrophe?\nA NiceCupOfTeaAndASitDown special report\n\n\nDinosaurs as we all know ruled the earth for about 270 million years, and although we can't be sure and despite there being no evidence it is now believed that they might have enjoyed a nice cup of tea and a sit down.\n\n\t\t\nA dinosaur thinking about having a nice cuppa, and maybe some kind of primitive biscuitFullsize image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what are the flimsy lines of reasoning behind this astounding new theory? Well there are two main reasons. It is now believed that dinosaurs evolved into birds so if birds like tea and sitting down then its a fair bet their ancestors, the dinosaurs, did as well. So look no further than the household budgie or the common garden sparrow both of which spend much of the day sitting or 'pearching' and would probably like tea if they were offered it. As for biscuits well they love them especially digestives. Secondly 270 million years is a long time to go without a cuppa and a sit down. It simply doesn't make sense that they would have gone all that time with out one. Ooo I just thought of another one, it could of helped them get up in the mornings. We all like a cuppa first thing so dinosaurs being that much bigger were bound to.\n\n\n\nAs for being wiped out at the end of the Cretaceous period this could simply be a matter of tea, the plant that is, not having yet evolved. The dinosaurs were so dismayed at the thought of having to wait several million years for tea to evolve that they all just upped and dropped dead. This was a pity as they could of probably made so sort of wonky tea out of cycads, horsetails and ferns if they had tried. Yes, I know this second theory is at odds with the first one, so one of them must be correct.\n\n\n\t<< Newer stuff | Older stuff >>\n\n\n\n?\n",

We hope that the proposals we are announcing today will make a big difference in removing unnecessary stress for patients and their families.”\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nParty Conference News: Giving the green light to high speed rail\n\n29 September 2008 - Campaign Literature\n\n   Theresa Villiers has laid out plans to introduce the next phase of high speed rail to the UK, in what she described as a “momentous step forward for Britain’s transport infrastructure”.\n\nA Conservative Government would build a new high speed rail line between Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and London, which would cut journey times between Birmingham and London to 40 minutes and between Leeds and London to less than an hour and a half.\n\nTheresa, the Shadow Transport Secretary, said that high speed rail would have many benefits for the UK.\n\nShe announced that a Conservative Government would say no to a third runway at Heathrow, and concentrate instead on the advantages of our high speed rail plan:\n\n“It will leave a lasting legacy for the future - and it will lay the foundations for a high speed network that I believe will one day stretch across the country.”\n\nPhilippa reports, \"This will make a massive difference to many people, in terms of business and leisure, and I welcome it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nParty Conference News: Good news on Council Tax\n\n29 September 2008 - Campaign Literature\n\n   The Shadow Chancellor, George Osborne, has announced a two-year freeze in council tax in order to help families cope with the rising cost of living.\n\nThis measure will save a typical Band D household over £200, and millions of families will benefit.\n\nThe Shadow Chancellor promised, “Every council tax bill of every family in every council that takes part will be frozen.”\n\nAnd he said, “Instead of council tax bills that rise year after year under Labour, millions of families will get help at the time they need it most. Conservatives will not leave people to struggle with the credit crunch alone.”\n\nPhilippa commented, \"This is good news, and shows yet again why it is time for a change\".\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nPhilippa speaks to Adrian Warnock\n\n28 September 2008 - News Item\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nParty Conference News: Honouring the Military Covenant\n\n28 September 2008 - Campaign Literature\n\n   Liam Fox has promised that a Conservative Government will honour the Military Covenant, that vital bond between the nation and the Armed Forces.\n\nThe Shadow Defence Secretary spoke during a session at Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham which looked at the findings of the independent Military Covenant Commission, whose members included Frederick Forsyth and Simon Weston.\n\nAnd he called for an end to squalid Armed Forces accommodation, better education and healthcare for servicemen, and improved services for Armed Forces families.\n\nPhilippa said, “While charities play a vital role in looking after our current and ex serviceman, they can never do enough. Our Government must honour their part of the covenant.”\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nGreen Garden Waste Success\n\n18 September 2008 - Campaign Literature\n\n   Philippa joined Carshalton & Wallington Candidate Ken Andrew to celebrate success in seeing the unpopular green garden waste scheme scrapped.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nPhilippa joins local Councillors in fighting for Worcester Park\n\n18 August 2008 - News Item\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nPhilippa calls for “unfair and unjustified” garden waste charge to be scrapped\n\n10 July 2008 - News Item\n\n   Philippa Stroud has called for the Lib Dem controlled London Borough of Sutton to think twice about the new £35 per bag annual charge for the green garden waste collection scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nConservatives win Henley and Labour loses deposit\n\n27 June 2008 - News Item\n\n   The By-Election was caused after Boris won the London Mayoral Campaign\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nKids Co Boss wants Philippa as an MP\n\n09 June 2008 - News Item\n\n   Camila founded the Charity Kids Company in 1996 in order to provide practical, emotional and educational support to vulnerable inner-city children and young people.\n\nMany of the 12,000 children who come to Kids Company have experienced severe and multiple trauma.

The company, which employs over 230 people, has become the UK's largest publisher of guides and websites to help people find the right school, college, university or course.Â  As a former publisher, he understands the challenges faced by the UKâ€™s arts and creative industries and knows first hand how vital they are for the UKâ€™s economy.\n\n    Jeremy is a strong believer that all parts of the Culture, Media and Sport brief play a key role in the quality of life agenda.Â  His top priority is to ensure the Olympic Games in London in 2012 will provide a lasting sporting legacy without taking much needed funds away from grassroots sport.\n\n    POSITIONS HELD: \n\n    \t\n        MP for South West Surrey, May 2005 - \n      \n\t\n        Shadow Minister for Disabled People, Dec 2005 - July 2007 \n\t\n        Shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, July 2007 - May 2010\n      \n\t\n        Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, May 2010 - \n      \n\n\n    PROUDEST POLITICAL ACHIEVEMENT: \n\n    Working with local campaigners to save the Royal Surrey County Hospitalâ€™s A&E department from closure.Â  A 6,000-strong rally, packed public meetings and a candle-lit vigil at Parliament all forced the local Primary Care Trust to keep the areaâ€™s vital resource open.\n\n    INTERESTS OUTSIDE OF POLITICS: \n\n    \t\n        Theatre \n\t\n        Classical music \n\t\n        Africa \n\t\n        Latin dancing \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\tNews\n\tSpeeches\n\tArticles\n\tBlogs\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA hung parliament puts politics behind closed doors\nMonday, April 26Â George Osborne explains why a hung parliament would be a change for the worse.\n\nLet's fight Labour's cider tax\nMonday, April 12Â We've launched local campaigns to scrape their plans for a 10% increase in tax on cider.\n\n\nGo to news\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDownloadable documents\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPersonal Additional Accommodation 12/05/09 - 24/09/09\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdministrative & Office 12/05/09 - 14/07/09\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tConservatives.TV\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJeremy Hunt launches the Technology Manifesto\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\tTo see the video player you need to have javascript enabled and the latest version of Flash.

Cytunwyd y byddaiâr Ysgrifennydd yn cynhyrchu adroddiad ar gyfer cyfarfod \nmis Medi syân gwerthusoâr sefyllfa o ran arolygiadau cymunedol presennol ac yn y \ndyfodol, aâr effaith ar ofynion staffio ac amserlen yr arolygiadau cymunedol. \n \n3.6 Roedd y Comisiwn oâr farn y dylid codiâr sefyllfa o ran yr anawsterau aâr peryglon posibl a \nwynebir gan y Comisiwn wrth gynnal yr arolygiadau cymunedol ac etholiadol yn ystod ei \ngyfarfod Ã¢âr Gweinidog dros Lywodraeth Leol ym mis Medi. \n \n3.7 Adroddwyd y byddai adroddiad drafft Ynys MÃ´n yn cael ei gyhoeddi erbyn diwedd mis \nGorffennaf 2007. \n \n 1Lgbc5m/2007 \nLlety \n \n3.8 Adroddodd yr Ysgrifennydd y byddai llety ar gael iâr Comisiwn yng Ngogledd Cymru oddi \nwrth Lywodraeth Cynulliad Cymru petai ei angen. \n \nCyfarfod Agored Cyffredinol Blynyddol   \n \n3.9 Adroddwyd y cadarnhawyd lleoliad CACB 2007 ar gyfer 8 Hydref 2007, ac y byddaiân \ncael ei gynnal yng Ngwestyâr Copthorne. \n \nGliniadur \n \n3.10 Adroddwyd bod y gliniadur iâr Dirprwy Gadeirydd wediâi archebu erbyn hyn, ac y \nbyddaiân cael ei dderbyn yn fuan. \n \n \n4. AROLYGIAD OâR CYMUNEDAU YM MWRDEISTREF SIROL WRECSAM â \nADRODDIAD YNGL Å¶N ÃâR CYNIGION TERFYNOL    \n \n Mwynglawdd / Coed-poeth \n \n4.1 Ystyriodd y Comisiwn y paragraffau ychwanegol y cynigiodd y Dirprwy Gadeirydd eu \nhychwanegu at yr adroddiad, a chytunwyd ar y rhain. \n \nThornleigh \n \n4.2 Adroddwyd bod Cyngor Bwrdeistref Sirol Wrecsam wedi cadarnhau na fyddaiâr Cynllun \nDatblygu Lleol ar gyfer Thornleigh yn cael ei gwblhau tan 2010.  Cytunwyd y byddai \nbrawddeg at y diben hwn yn cael ei chynnwys yn yr adroddiad ym mharagraff 6.10. \n \nBrychdyn a Brymbo \n \n4.3 Adroddwyd y cynhaliwyd ail ymweliad Ã¢ safleâr ffin rhwng cymunedau Brychdyn a \nBrymbo i edrych ar y newidiadau a awgrymwyd gan y Cynghorydd Wilkinson.  \nCadarnhaodd yr ymweliad Ã¢âr safle farn y Cynghorydd Wilkinson na ddylid trosglwyddo \nardal Parc Brynmally / Heol yr Orsaf i Brymbo am fod ganddo fwy o affinedd Ã¢ Brychdyn.  \nRoedd y Cynghorydd Wilkinson hefyd oâr farn bod gan y Lodge affinedd Ã¢ Brychdyn a \nBrymbo ill dau, ond cysylltiadau ychydig yn gryfach Ã¢ Brychdyn.  Cadarnhaodd yr \nymweliad Ã¢âr safle bod hyn yn wir hefyd.  Cytunwyd y dylai adlinioâr ffin rhwng \nCymunedau Brychdyn a Brymbo, a fabwysiadwyd ar gyfer y Cynigion Terfynol, \nadlewyrchuâr sylwadau a wnaed gan y Cynghorydd Wilkinson a chanfyddiadauâr ymweliad \nÃ¢âr safle. \n \nGwersyllt / Llai \n \n4.4 Nodwyd y gosodwyd paragraff ychwanegol yn yr adroddiad i esbonio na fu modd iâr \nComisiwn edrych ar y ffin rhwng Cymunedau Gwersyllt a Llai am nad oedd Llai wediâi \ngynnwys yn y cyfarwyddiadau a gyhoeddwyd gan Lywodraeth Cynulliad Cymru. \n \nSesswick / Marchwiel \n \n 2Lgbc5m/2007 \n4.5 Adroddwyd y byddai paragraff ychwanegol yn cael ei osod yn yr adroddiad hwn i esbonio \npam na fyddaiâr cynnig a gyflwynwyd gan Gyngor Cymuned Sesswick i adlinioâi ffin Ã¢ \nMarchwiail ar hyd ffordd a gynlluniwyd ond a oedd heb ei hadeiladu yn cael ei fabwysiadu. \n \n Trefniadau Etholiadol Ãl-ddilynol   \n \n4.6 Cytunwyd y dylai Cymuned Holt fod yn ddi-ward ac y dylid lleihau ei chynrychiolaeth o \n11 Cynghorydd i 10. \n \n4.7 Nodwyd y byddaiâr trefniadau etholiadol ar gyfer Brymbo a Brychdyn yn newid o \nganlyniad iâr penderfyniad i newid y cynigion ar gyfer y ffin. \n \n4.8 Cytunwyd newidiadau etholiadol y Fwrdeistref Sirol. \n \n Cynlluniau Datblygu Lleol   \n \n4.9 Cytunwyd y byddaiâr llythyr at Gyngor Bwrdeistref Sirol Wrecsam, a anfonwyd gydag \nadroddiad Cynigion Terfynol y Comisiwn, yn ei wneud yn ofynnol iddynt ystyried y \nffiniau cymunedol newydd wrth gynhyrchu cynlluniau datblygu ar gyfer y dyfodol. \n \n \n5. TRAFOD AROLYGIADAU ETHOLIADOL  \n \n5.1 Trafododd y Comisiwn heriau posibl y gellid eu cael wrth gynnal yr arolygiad etholiadol a \noedd ar ddod.  Y gobaith oedd y byddai modd iâr awdurdodau lleol ddarparu rhagolygon \ncywirach o ffigurau etholiadol nag a gafwyd yn ystod yr arolygiad diwethaf.  Roedd yn \ndebygol maiâr brif her fyddai cyhoeddi unrhyw gyfarwyddiadau amserol gan Lywodraeth \nCynulliad Cymru.  Ystyriwyd y byddaiân bosibl iâr Cynulliad, efallai, gynnwys amserlen \ngyffredinol ar gyfer yr arolygiad fel rhan oâu llythyr cylch gwaith blynyddol at y \nComisiwn, yn hytrach na chyhoeddi cyfarwyddiadau fel y cyfryw, os mai amseru oedd yr \nunig bwnc yr oedd y Gweinidog yn dymuno dylanwadu arno. \n \n5.2 Ystyriwyd bod yn rhaid iâr rheolau ar gyfer cynnal arolygiadau etholiadol, a nodir yn \nAtodlen 11 Deddf Llywodraeth Leol, fod yn fan cychwyn ar gyfer cynnal yr arolygiad.  Er \nnad oedd y rheolau yn y ddeddfwriaeth yn nodi y dylid defnyddio cymunedau ac wardiau \ncymunedol i ffurfio adrannau etholiadol, eu bod yn nodi na ddylid torri rhwymau lleol ac y \ndylai pob ward gymunedol a chanddi gyngor cymunedol a phob cymuned di-ward orwedd \nyn gyfan gwbl oddi mewn i un adran etholiadol.  Felly, byddaiân anodd cydymffurfio Ã¢âr \nrheolau pe na bai cymunedau a wardiau cymunedol yn cael eu defnyddio fel blociau \nadeiladu. \n \n5.3 Nodwyd nad ywâr Ddeddf yn cyfyngu ar nifer y cynghorwyr ar gyfer pob awdurdod lleol.  \nRoedd uchafswm ar gyfer nifer y Cynghorwyr ar gyfer pob awdurdod lleol yn debygol  \ngael ei fanylu mewn unrhyw gyfarwyddiadau a gyhoeddir gan Lywodraeth Cynulliad \nCymru.  Yn absenoldeb unrhyw gyfarwyddiadau, byddaiân ofynnol iâr Comisiwn gytuno ar \nuchafswm y cynghorwyr ar gyfer pob awdurdod lleol unigol, gan ystyried ffactorau e.e. \nnewidiadau yn yr etholaeth ar sail y trefniadau etholiadol cyfredol.  Fodd bynnag, gallai \ncynydduân sylweddol aelodaeth awdurdod lleol arwain at anawsterau o ran dod o hyd i \nddigon o ymgeiswyr syân dymuno sefyll i gael eu hethol, a thrwy hynny, o bosibl gynyddu \nnifer y seddi heb eu cystadlu. \n \n 3Lgbc5m/2007 \n5.4 Ystyriwyd na ddylai unrhyw gyfarwyddiadau a gyhoeddwyd iâr Comisiwn fanylu pa \nadrannau etholiadol y gellid eu hystyried ar gyfer aml-aelodaeth, am fod y cyfyngiad hwn \nwedi achosi heriau sylweddol wrth gynnal yr arolygiad etholiadol blaenorol. \n \n5.6 Cytunwyd y byddai angen ysgrifennu at y Gweinidog dros Lywodraeth Leol cyn y \ncyfarfod ar 17 Medi 2007 i drafod a fyddai cyfarwyddiadau yn cael eu cyhoeddi iâr \nComisiwn ac ar ba ffurf. \n \n5.7 Nodwyd bod y Comisiwn Etholiadol wedi cynnal ymgynghoriad yn 2005 ynghylch \narolygiadau etholiadol lleol yn Lloegr, a wnaed gan Bwyllgor Ffiniau Lloegr, gydaâr \nymgynghoriad yn canolbwyntio ar sut y gellid gwellaâr dull o gynnal arolygiadau \netholiadol yn y dyfodol.  Cytunwyd y byddaiâr Ysgrifennydd yn canfod beth fuâr ymateb \niâr ymgynghoriad hwn. \n \n \n6. UNRHYW FATER ARALL \n \nY weithdrefn gwyno   \n \n6.1 Adroddwyd bod ymgynghorydd cyfreithiol y Comisiwn wedi cadarnhau nad oedd y \nComisiwn yn dod o dan awdurdod yr Ombwdsmon Llywodraeth Leol ond ei fod yn dod o \ndan awdurdod y Comisiynydd Gwybodaeth o ran cwynion a gynhwysir gan y Ddeddf \nRhyddid Gwybodaeth.  Cytunwyd rhoi paragraff ychwanegol i nodi hyn yn y Weithdrefn \nGwyno. \n \n Trefniadau Archwilio \n \n6.2 Adroddwyd y cafwyd ymateb oddi wrth Archwilydd Cyffredinol Cymru a nodai \nsylwadauâr Comisiwn o ran newid y partner archwilio allanol.  Esboniodd y llythyr y \nbyddai barn y Comisiwn yn cael ei hystyried cyn gwneud penderfyniad terfynol. \n \n Mater Staffio \n \n6.3 Adroddwyd y bu ymgeisydd yn llwyddiannus wrth geisio am swydd Cynorthwyydd \nArolygu a hysbysebwyd, ac y byddaiân dechrauâr swydd ar 3 Medi 2007. \n \n Penodi \n \n6.4 Adroddwyd bod proses penodi ar y cyd ar gyfer aelodau newydd o Gomisiwn Ffiniau i \nGymru a Chomisiwn Ffiniau Llywodraeth Leol i Gymru ar y gweill ar hyn o bryd.  Byddai \nfformat y weithdrefn yn cael ei gytuno gan Y Weinyddiaeth Gyfiawnder, Llywodraeth \nCynulliad Cymru ac Ysgrifennydd Gwladol Cymru. \n \n7. DYDDIAD Y CYFARFOD NESAF \n \n7.1 Cytunwyd mai 17 Medi 2007 fyddai dyddiad y cyfarfod nesaf, ar Ã´l y cyfarfod Ã¢âr \nGweinidog, a fyddai'n cychwyn am 12 canol dydd. \n \n \n 4\n",

I am confident that whoever takes over from me as the Labour candidate will have every chance of holding the seat for Labour and helping the party go on to win an historic fourth term. I do not wish to continue working a 12-14 hour day, six days a week for the next five years. My commitment to my constituents means I could not do the job in any other way.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am proud of Labour’s achievements during our thirteen years in Government. We have made record investment in the NHS and our schools, introduced the first minimum wage, equality legislation, help for families and pensioners, which have made such a difference to places like Halesowen and Rowley Regis.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have worked and campaigned for the Labour Party for over fifty years and will continue to work as hard as I can to retain the Halesowen and Rowley Regis constituency and to keep a Labour Government at the election.”\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \t \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRowley Hospital NOT Closing\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n \n\nFollowing inaccurate rumours surrounding the future of Rowley Hospital I want to categorically state that Rowley Hospital is not closing.\n\n\n\nRowley Hospital treats some 12000 patients a year and will continue to do so.\n\n\n\nThe GP led ward – Eliza Tinsley – which was a pilot project in partnership with Sandwell Primary Care Trust has closed because it was not possible to provide continuing GP medical cover. However having spoken to Rob Bacon Chief Executive of the Primary Care Trust, I understand they are continuing to look into the availability of other medical cover. \n\n\n\nMcCarthy ward is currently a rehabilitation ward and following a consultation, the services may move to the Sandwell site. This is based on the idea that all rehabilitation services will be in one place and will allow for other services to move to Rowley such as diagnostic services and Ophthalmics. These proposals are based upon designing and providing the best services for local people and having spoken to Chief Executive John Adler I have been assured that there will be no redundancies for people based at Rowley Hospital and that Rowley is still very much an important part of delivering healthcare services for local people.\n\n\n\nRowley Regis hospital is not closing and it has already been established that new services will be moving to the hospital site, therefore the “Save Rowley Hospital Campaign” that Conservative Parliamentary Candidate James Morris has launched is completely disingenuous and shameful politicking. \n\n\n\nIt is a matter of public fact that there are plans to move services to Rowley Regis hospital and therefore this blatant scaremongering is wrong. I am very surprised that James Morris would go to such a low level to score cheap political points and attempt to claim credit for services that are already in the pipeline.\n\n\n\n \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \t\n    \n        News\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\t\n\n\n\t\n    \n        \n\n        Will you leave a Will?\n\n        \n\t  \n     \n\n     \n\tThousands of people die every year without leaving a Will. When someone dies without leaving a Will, dealing with their estate can be complicated. It can also take a long time - months or even years in complex cases. Many people are unaware just how complicated things can get when someone dies without leaving a proper Will in place.   60% of adults have not written a Will.   Wrong assumptions about Wills   - Nearly 40% of people believe that if someone dies without leaving a Will their partner will automatically inherit all their...\nmore...\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n    \n        \n\n        Commonwealth Speakers Conference\n\n        \n\t  \n     \n\n     \n\tShortly after Christmas, I was honoured to represent Mr Speaker in my role as Deputy Speaker at the annual Conference of Speakers and Presiding Officers which this year was held in New Delhi.

These savings will make a real difference to thousands of young people.  \n\n \n\nHowever, your child trust fund could be at risk.  If the Conservatives win the next election, they would scrap the child trust fund for families earning over £16 000 a year.  They would also remove tax credits from 130,000 middle income families.\n\n \n\nAnd instead of helping the majority of hard working families they have chosen a tax giveaway of £200,000 to the wealthiest 3,000 estates in the country.\n\n \n\nSo under the Tories if you’ve got kids and earn more than £16,040, you’ll lose £1,000.  But if you stand to inherit a million pound estate you could gain £200,000.  \n\n \n\nThere has been a lot of guessing about what the Tories might do if they win the next General Election.   Now we know. The Conservatives will hit families in the mainstream middle at the same time as they fund a tax giveaway to the wealthiest estates.\n\n \n\nSign my \"Hands off our Child Trust Fund\" petition\n\n It's vital that we stand together and show our support for the Child Trust Fund.

This has been proposed by Nerys Evans. This morning, we will hear two sets of evidence, one from the Environment Agency and later on from Cylch.\n\n\n\tI welcome the representatives of the Environment Agency, Ms Nadia de Longhi, a strategy and policy manager on waste regulations, and Cathy O?Brien, the strategy and policy manager for the waste strategy. Welcome. We have a number of questions that we will be asking you, and if, when we have finished, you feel that there are any other points that you would like to put forward, please do so.\n\n\n\tIt is clear from your evidence that you welcome the aim of the proposed Measure to improve transparency in relation to how local authorities deal with recyclate. Can you confirm for the record whether you support the general principles of the proposed Measure and whether you think that there is a need for this legislation?\n\n\n\tMs de Longhi: We do support the principles of the proposed Measure in providing transparency and information to the public, and we also see that it could provide reliable data on recyclate exported beyond Europe, giving evidence on a level of certainty to the waste management industry that could stimulate growth in local infrastructure with the benefits of sustainability and the creation of green jobs. However, we have some practical concerns about the detail of the proposed Measure, about obtaining accurate information, and also we want to see waste handled in the most appropriate way for the environment to maximise its potential as a resource, focusing on the quality of recyclate rather than on the final destination. For some of the materials, export may still be the best environmental option currently available.\n\n\n\tAs for whether there is a need for new legislation, the information required by the proposed Measure on final destination and on recovery and disposal rates is not provided through the current legislation regimes of duty of care for movements within the United Kingdom or within the transfrontier shipment regulations for export. Although the landfill allowance scheme partially provides that information, it is only insofar as it relates to the diversion of biodegradable waste from landfill. We believe that it would be possible to achieve similar aims without legislation by adapting some of the current systems and arrangements. \n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: Thank you very much. In evidence to the committee, Nerys explained that some local authorities in Wales are unable to provide details of whether recycling takes place, while others could only partially provide such information. If local authorities are not required to collect and provide such information, can you explain how transparency can be achieved?\n\n\n\tDr O?Brien: In our experience, most local authorities know where the majority of their recyclates are destined for, so they have reasonable levels of information available to them. Under the landfill allowance scheme, we have audited local authorities? data availability on recyclates, so where the materials then go to, and we find that the majority of them know where the majority of the waste goes. There are problems when local authorities use charitable organisations, as there is no contract in place, and so there are sometimes gaps in the information, but they tend to relate to quite small quantities of the municipal waste that authorities handle. So, overall, they do have the information available. \n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: That is interesting, thank you. Again, in evidence to the committee, Nerys Evans explained that there is currently no requirement on local authorities to provide information to the public about the final destination of the waste, and so that provides sufficient justification for the new legislation. How do you respond to that?\n\n\n\tDr O?Brien: It is interesting, because quite clearly local authorities could provide that information. Somerset authority, for example, provides comprehensive information on its website, but it does not go to the level of detail that the proposed Measure seeks. It does not state precisely which facility in China its waste paper was processed at, but it says that waste paper was exported to China for reprocessing.\n\n\n\tThat level of information is reasonably easily achievable for most waste, so it could be done and it could help the public understand better what happens to their waste. However, focusing just on the small amount of waste that is exported might have a negative impact, because it suggests that all the material that is collected is exported when actually only a very small proportion of it ends up in facilities abroad. So, it would be better to contextualise the information across the range of materials that are handled for recycling by a local authority so that the public can see the proportion handled relatively locally and that handled further afield. It would give authorities an opportunity to explain why some of the materials are handled further afield, because they tend to prefer to recycle materials locally rather than abroad. That tends to be the general presumption. They would prefer to do that, but, for some materials, where they cannot find a market locally, they end up having to send it further afield. If we focus just on that, it might give the wrong impression.\n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: Fine, thank you very much. \n\n\n\tNick Ramsay: Good morning. When the Minister for Environment, Sustainability and Housing, Jane Davidson, gave evidence in written form to the committee, she said that although she is sympathetic to the reasons behind the proposed Measure, she thinks that it might be possible to use the WasteDataFlow system to find that information instead. Do you think that that would be just as effective as the proposed Measure, or do you think that the proposed Measure covers areas that the WasteDataFlow system would not?\n\n\n\tDr O?Brien: The WasteDataFlow system could be adapted to hold the information that is needed to comply with this proposed Measure, and it is available to the public in theory. It is a publicly accessible database, but it is a complex database. Given that, it tends to be accessed only by waste professionals?your officials and we use it for the collection of municipal waste data. It would not provide the same transparency as putting this information in the public domain, but it would provide a framework so that local authorities could store information in a way that was visible to your officials and us, without going that step further by putting it in the public domain.\n\n\n\tUnder the landfill allowance scheme, which also uses WasteDataFlow, we verify the information that local authorities input, but one thing that bothers us slightly is that verifying some of the information on reprocessing waste from Wales abroad, particularly the proportion of materials that is rejected out of a load that is accepted for reprocessing, for example, would be very difficult for us or anybody. \n\n\n\t9.40 a.m.\n\n\n\tIn looking at it in terms of what we could do to check up on that, the only economic way of doing that is to develop some default values for typical rejection rates of different types of materials and grades of materials, but even that might be difficult to establish. There would have to be quite a lot of data gathering in order to do that, and data gathering abroad tends to be quite an expensive occupation.\n\n\n\tMs de Longhi: May I just add that the WasteDataFlow system as it stands would require some technical enhancements to allow this information to be put in, as it is not currently there? There would be additional resource required to make sure that it could contain that information.\n\n\n\tNick Ramsay: It seems to me that you have got the two elements of this argument. You have the data gathering on the one side and then the obligation to provide the information in an understandable form on the other. When Nerys Evans gave evidence to the committee she was quite clear that she did not think that if you left it to local authorities on a voluntary basis that that would be sufficient. She did not think that they would have the necessary framework to release that information. Do you agree with her on that?\n\n\n\tDr O?Brien: Yes, there is a degree of that, but I do not necessarily think that the proposed Measure takes you very much further with that in that it makes it unclear as to whether there are any teeth behind it, because, if the local authorities do not comply, who is going to do anything about it? It comes under a section in the legislation that just provides powers to local authorities. It does not stipulate the monitoring authority or powers for Assembly officials, so it is a bit unclear. We are not sure as to what would happen.\n\n\n\tMohammad Asghar: My question relates to the timing of the proposed Measure. It has been suggested that, if made, the proposed environmental protection and waste management legislative competence Order will provide an opportunity to bring forward legislation that deals more holistically with waste management issues. The Order would provide the Assembly with the power to compel private waste companies to provide information regarding the final destination of the waste. In view of this, do you think the proposed Measure could be seen to be premature?\n\n\n\tMs de Longhi: If the LCO does come into force, we agree that there is an opportunity to look at this area more holistically and to encompass an approach that could consider a broader scope of waste streams beyond the municipal stream, and this could be better than the narrow scope within the proposed Measure. As Cathy has explained, the proposed Measure only covers a small proportion of the waste stream in that it only relates to municipal arisings and that small proportion of municipal waste that is then exported beyond Europe. \n\n\n\tAs we stated, we would like to see an approach that provides a focus upstream on collection and recovery of recyclate rather than focusing on end destination only, to improve its quality as a resource and ensure that it is fit for purpose. So, we think that there is an opportunity to tie into an LCO further down the line, although we are obviously unclear of what the timing of that could be.\n\n\n\tMohammad Asghar: So, you do not think that it is premature?\n\n\n\tMs de Longhi: It goes some way to providing some useful information to the public, and, in that way, it is beneficial. However, we think that it could be seen as premature in that it could be encompassed in a much broader range of measures if it was covered under the environmental LCO.\n\n\n\tMohammad Asghar: Nerys Evans suggested that, subject to the success of the proposed environmental protection and waste management LCO, a future Measure could be brought forward to extend the power of this proposed Measure. Should it be approved? What are your views on that?\n\n\n\tMs de Longhi: I think that, for the reasons I have outlined, that is very true. If the LCO does come forward, we would like to see further Measures that could widen the scope of this proposed Measure. We would agree with that.\n\n\n\tAnn Jones: Good morning. You stated in your written evidence, and you have reiterated it this morning, that some local authorities already provide you with information on the final destination of materials. If that is the case, why is it not possible for all local authorities to do this now?\n\n\n\tDr O?Brien: All local authorities could do most of it now, but not all local authorities have total knowledge of where the 100 per cent of their waste ends up. The majority of them could do it now. They obviously do not choose to do it now, but focusing on that small proportion that is exported beyond Europe seems to not provide the full picture to the public, which I think is important. If one is going to provide this information, you need to provide all of it rather than just a small part of it. It may give the public the impression that it is always exported to China. Without proper contextualisation, it could have a negative effect on public attitude to recycling.\n\n\n\tAnn Jones: The Welsh Local Government Association?s written evidence, which I think everyone has seen, asserts that you, as the environment agency, have guidance to support the landfill allowance scheme, which ensures that local authorities are already providing as much information as possible now on the end destination and the recyclate collected. So, what are your views on the WLGA?s written evidence?\n\n\n\tDr O?Brien: Under the landfill allowance scheme, we require local authorities to provide us with information on the last destination within the UK that exported waste goes to. That enables us to ensure that the quality of the material exported is of an acceptable standard to comply with green list requirements under the transfrontier shipment regulations, so we can focus regulatory efforts on the last port of call within the UK. We do not require them to provide information on further offshore movement of that material, which is a limitation, but we look at it from a point of view of verification. We would be unable to verify the details as to what happened to that material beyond the UK shores.\n\n\n\tAnn Jones: Thank you. Can you confirm that the proposed Measure would require local authorities to provide a greater level of detail than is currently provided to support the LAs? \n\n\n\tDr O?Brien: Yes, it would be a greater level of detail. \n\n\n\tAnn Jones: Has the guidance that you have issued resulted in an increase in the provision of information by local authorities and the quality of that information? If it has, does it go some way towards satisfying the aims of the proposed Measure in improving transparency?\n\n\n\tDr O?Brien: Yes, we do get more information from the local authorities. The landfill allowance scheme is a legislative provision that has only been in place a relatively short period of time. It was introduced through regulations in 2004, which, in environmental law terms, is relatively recent. \n\n\n\tWe have issued guidance to the local authorities on what they should be putting in terms of the final destination and, as a result of that guidance, we do get more information through the WasteDataFlow system. We are about to publish the reports on the audits that were done on all 22 local authorities in Wales in relation to the detail behind the information that they provide on WasteDataFlow, and that will be going in the public domain some time later this month. They are quite substantial reports on each local authority?s municipal waste data, and that exercise showed us that most of the local authorities had most of the information that was required. \n\n\n\tWe highlighted within those reports, and in our work with those authorities, where the shortcomings are and how they could improve their systems to provide more information to us as the monitoring authority for the landfill allowance scheme.\n\n\n\tThat information is in the WasteDataFlow system, which, as I explained, is technically available to the public but not readily accessible by the public. It is quite a complicated system, so it does not provide the transparency that the proposed Measure seems to ask for.\n\n\n\t9.50 a.m.\n\n\n\tAnn Jones: Section 1 of the proposed Measure seeks to introduce a new section 55A to the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Your written evidence raises concerns about the ability of local authorities to provide the information that would be required under section 55A(5). Can you expand on why you think it would be difficult for local authorities to secure accurate data to meet the requirements suggested in section 55A(5)?\n\n\n\tDr O?Brien: It depends on who they use for their recycling services and on how complex those arrangements are. If an authority uses a materials recovery facility, after sorting the waste, a proportion of that waste might not get properly sorted and so it gets passed onto a further facility, which might take waste from a range of other local authorities as well, so you would start to lose the identity of the waste. Then if a small proportion is exported abroad, it would be quite difficult for the local authority to retain an understanding of where the material went.\n\n\n\tSo, it is quite difficult to know about 100 per cent of waste, because small proportions tend to lose their identity in the processing sequence. However, there are some straightforward transactions by which waste from a local authority is exported directly, it knows where it has gone, it has the information and it can provide that to us and to the public, as required.\n\n\n\tFor small parts of waste, it will be quite difficult. For other parts of municipal waste that is exported for reprocessing, it may be more straightforward. It really all depends on the local arrangements and through how many hands that material passes before it gets to its final destination.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tEleanor Burnham: Yr ydych wedi honni y dylem gael newidiadau deddfwriaethol, gan gynnwys ar lefel Ewrop, i alluogi awdurdodau lleol i gael yr wybodaeth sy?n ofynnol o dan adran 55A(5). A allwch chi esbonio pa newidiadau sydd eu hangen arnom i sicrhau hynny? \tEleanor Burnham: You have claimed that legislative changes are required, including some at a European level, to enable local authorities to obtain the information required by section 55A(5). Can you explain which legislative changes would be necessary to ensure that?\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMs de Longhi: Sorry, I shall answer in English, if that is okay.\n\n\n\tEleanor Burnham: Absolutely.\n\n\n\tMs de Longhi: I can take this headset off now, can I?\n\n\n\tEleanor Burnham: If you would like to, yes.\n\n\n\tMs de Longhi: You can hear yourself, which is very strange. \n\n\n\tBoth the duty of care and the transfrontier shipment regulations as they relate specifically to green-list recyclable waste in this proposed Measure are largely self-policing systems, and we are conscious that any changes to any of these regimes will need to be considered in light of any additional burden placed on us, as the regulators, or the local authority or business. Having said that, it might be possible to consider some amendments to the duty of care to achieve a full cradle-to-grave audit of where waste has gone, as that would overcome some of the issues that Cathy just discussed with waste moving from one reprocessor to another and potentially losing its identity. That could help by providing the relevant information along the chain. However, a consultation document on a review of the duty of care was published earlier this year jointly by the Assembly and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and that did not include that, so the timing could be difficult.\n\n\n\tThe transfrontier shipment of waste regulations are the UK?s transposition of European regulations and they could be amended to require the return of annex VII forms, namely the documents that accompany recyclate and any green-list waste moved, either to the Environment Agency or to local authorities. That could provide information on the final destination of recyclate but not on recovery and disposal rates or reject rates, which the proposed Measure requires. It would work only if there is a presumption of either full recovery?that the material is of a suitable nature for recovery abroad?or on the agreement of a default value for a reject rate, as Cathy described earlier.\n\n\n\tDifficulties would arise if changes to the regulations applied only in Wales. If Welsh recyclate was moved to a reprocessor in England prior to export, that chain of custody would be lost in a return back to us or the local authority as a Welsh regulator. We would see these as new duties on a regulator and there is no charging scheme associated with that. So, there is potentially a resourcing issue, and we would look to the Government to fund that activity. In addition, the Assembly Government does not currently have the legislative competence to make amendments to the transfrontier shipment regulations.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tEleanor Burnham: Mae Cymdeithas Llywodraeth Leol Cymru yn honni y byddai hyn yn costio mwy o arian i lywodraeth leol hefyd oherwydd y cynnydd yn y gwaith y byddai?n gorfod ei wneud i gasglu?r wybodaeth. Beth yw eich barn am hynny?\tEleanor Burnham: The Welsh Local Government Association claims that it would cost local government more because of the increase in the work that it would have to undertake to get more information. What do you think about that?\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMs de Longhi: I think that there would be costs associated for local government. I cannot really comment specifically on the numbers that it has quoted and whether they would be appropriate, but we agree that there is potential for a new duty to incur further costs. \n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tEleanor Burnham: Pa wybodaeth y gellid disgwyl yn rhesymol i awdurdodau lleol ei chael ac, wedi hynny, ei chyhoeddi heb wneud rhagor o newidiadau deddfwriaethol?\tEleanor Burnham: What information could local authorities be reasonably expected to obtain and subsequently publish without making further legislative changes?\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tDr O?Brien: Our view varies. Local authorities in Wales could voluntarily provide the level of information currently published by the Somerset Waste Partnership, perhaps with some persuasion. However, that does not quite go to the level of detail that the proposed Measure seeks, because it does not cover the precise facility abroad that the material goes to.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tEleanor Burnham: Rhywbeth arall a ddywedwyd gan Gymdeithas Llywodraeth Leol Cymru oedd bod gan wastraff fel adnodd bris ar y farchnad agored. Honnwyd nad oedd yn bosibl rhoi mwy o wybodaeth oherwydd sensitifrwydd masnachol, ond y byddai pris yr adnodd yn lleihau fel bod colled ariannol i lywodraeth leol pe bai?n gorfod rhoi mwy o wybodaeth. Beth yw eich barn am hynny?\tEleanor Burnham: Another thing said by the Welsh Local Government Association was that waste as a resource has a price on the open market. It claimed that it is not possible to provide more information for reasons of commercial sensitivity, but that the price of this resource would reduce resulting in a financial loss to local government if it was obliged to provide more information. What is your view on that?\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tDr O?Brien: It certainly could happen. Contracts with commercial waste carriers and managers require change to get information in some cases. It could result in a contractor preferring not to take up a new contract being offered because it requires more difficult things. So, a contractor may choose not to do business with a Welsh authority, which would limit a local authority?s choice of contractors. In turn, that would have an impact on the financial return that it gets for its recyclates, which helps financially to support its waste management services.\n\n\n\tIt is also possible that local authorities have difficulties understanding apportionment, which is where the material goes to other facilities and gets mixed with waste from other authorities and other sources. They may have difficulty trying to tease out of that whether any of their waste was exported. Yes, that facility sent a load of material to China, but whose waste was it? That is a difficult question and that may cause a problem. So, yes, it will cause problems with the availability of services to local authorities.\n\n\n\t10.00 a.m.\n\n\n\tIt will cause some degree of financial impact on what moneys they get for their recyclates and it may also, in some circumstances and on occasion, cause material that could have been exported for reprocessing not being exported and, in the absence of a local market, being disposed of rather than recycled in the full sense of the word.\n\n\n\tThat would be a fairly negative impact of this, and it is something that could happen, because the materials recovery market in the UK and Europe is less in volume than one might hope, largely because a lot of the manufacturing industry is located away from Europe. In the global market, it has become cheaper to make things in the far east and export them back to the UK. Consequently, a lot of the market for reprocessing materials is at a distance. If we accept that it is fine to import goods, we should accept that it is fine to export our secondary raw materials for those countries to use. It would be better to do that than to dispose of the material more locally in the absence of a local market.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tEleanor Burnham: Mewn tystiolaeth i?r pwyllgor, awgrymodd Nerys Evans y dylai?r wybodaeth sy?n ofynnol dan y Mesur arfaethedig fod yn eithaf hawdd i awdurdodau lleol ei chasglu. Nododd mai dim ond casglu?r wybodaeth berthnasol a?i throsglwyddo i awdurdodau lleol fyddai?n rhaid i gwmn?au gwastraff preifat ei wneud. Beth yw eich ymateb i hynny?\tEleanor Burnham: In evidence to the committee, Nerys Evans suggested that the information required under the proposed Measure should be relatively straightforward for local authorities to obtain. She stated that private waste companies would just need to collect the relevant information and pass it on to local authorities. How do you respond to this?\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tDr O?Brien: Yes, it is a simple matter, in that they could do it. They may not wish to do it, because they may consider that local authorities might, when they have the information, cut out the middle man and export it direct. There is some reluctance for that reason. Yes, we feel that, probably, many local authorities would need to change their contracts with the organisations that provide recycling services for them. Contracts in the recycling world tend to be reasonably short term, fortunately. The longest ones tend to be two or three years, rather than the longer term residual waste contracts, which tend to be for 20 or 25 years.\n\n\n\tThere are difficulties in terms of the availability of the information, in that some exporters who do this professionally play the market. They will change from day to day where they send the materials, because they are looking for the best price. It could be quite difficult for them to obtain that documentary trail back to the local authorities, depending on how many other parties there are within the chain between the exporter and the local authority originators, of which there may be many, because of waste moving from facility to facility, being bulked up and mixed with wastes from other places in order to produce a containerload of a particular type of paper or plastic for export.\n\n\n\tEleanor Burnham: So, if we take on this proposed Measure we need to make sure that the general public understands the commercial nature of this asset that is in the open market and that there will be fluctuation in prices? Could this proposed Measure impact negatively on the price that this commodity secures for the local authority?\n\n\n\tDr O?Brien: Yes, to individual local authorities, because it may limit their market. They may choose to limit their market, because they may not wish to be seen to be exporting materials. Prices in the UK and Europe tend to be lower, because the market is somewhat more restricted, and it will impact on them financially, in the sense that, if you take that choice you will have less money available. The market operates as a commodity market, and is very similar to any other commodity market. How oil is supplied and how it reaches a refinery to produce the petrol that we buy at the pumps is a very complex system. Providing any raw materials to any industry is complex and involves market prices and, quite often, people who make their living out of trying to get the best out of that system.\n\n\n\tEleanor Burnham: Thank you. \n\n\n\tNick Ramsay: Following on from Eleanor?s line of questioning, we have really got to know the potential problems with this proposed Measure, with regard to the issue of contracts. I was very interested in what you said about the impact on the price of the commodity but also about local authorities and the issues that arise. When I was a local authority member, before I became an Assembly Member, I saw that the issues that arise with contracts can be quite complex. Do you think that it is too easy to underestimate the problems that this renegotiation of contracts might actually create? There is also the issue of different authorities having different time lags with their contracts.\n\n\n\tDr O?Brien: Yes, you can do it at the natural break in the contract: when the contract you have at the moment ends, you can ensure that you have the right conditions in the new contract. However, you may find that fewer contractors will be interested in it, because it limits them or requires them to do more work in terms of the paper trail. If you try to do it in the middle of the contract, the process can be quite expensive and can be quite litigious, so I really would not advise?\n\n\n\tNick Ramsay: How expensive?\n\n\n\tDr O?Brien: I cannot give you a figure on that, but I know of local authorities and waste contractors that have ended up at the High Court. I do not think that sort of process is cheap.\n\n\n\tNick Ramsay: Looking at the flip side of trying to make the proposed Measure effective, will this impact negatively and delay the changing of the contract? Does that make what the proposed Measure is trying to achieve quite difficult?\n\n\n\tDr O?Brien: I think that, if you were to introduce it with a timeframe, it might be achievable in the sense of giving the local authorities the opportunity, when their current contracts come to an end, to put a new contract in place that will provide them with that information. Where they do not have a contract at the moment?for example, that is quite often the case with textiles, because they are handled by charitable organisations?it gives them the opportunity to put a contract in place to ensure that they get that information. That could make it doable, but it is not something that is immediate.\n\n\n\tMs de Longhi: That brings us back to the issue of timing that we mentioned earlier, and whether that time lag on contracts fits in better with waiting for a broader Measure under the LCO.\n\n\n\tNick Ramsay: I think that the issue of contracts is important with regard to the proposed Measure. We all agree with certain things yhsy the proposed Measure is trying to achieve, but if councils were to get bogged down in costs and legal claims, the alarm bells would start ringing for me.\n\n\n\tI will leave that aside for one moment. When Nerys Evans gave evidence to the committee, she spoke about section 55A(5) of the Act, which is to do with the information that an authority might not actually hold, and the difficulties that that would pose in being transparent if they do not have that information. She said that her proposed Measure would require an authority to take reasonable steps to obtain that. Do you think that that helps address your concerns that local authorities will, in practice, find it very difficult to meet that requirement for reasonable steps to get information?\n\n\n\tDr O?Brien: Yes, our view is that the difficulties exist for relatively small elements of waste that are recycled at the moment where contracts are not in place, where your local authority is providing the material to a charitable organisation and they have not deemed it fit to put a contract in place, or where there is a complex chain of people handling the material. That may or may not result in its export from a facility in England. I am aware of local authorities in Wales that use facilities in England, so even if the transfrontier shipment regulations were to change, with the annex VII documentation, it may be impossible to get hold of that sort of information for Wales.\n\n\n\t10.10 a.m.\n\n\n\tNick Ramsay: So, 'reasonable steps?, which is an understandable thing to include in the proposed Measure, might not actually achieve very much at all?\n\n\n\tDr O?Brien: I can see that some authorities that use facilities in England, where they can lose track of the waste, may say that they have taken reasonable steps but are unable to provide the information. As things currently stand, they may not be able to provide the information for some elements of the waste stream, but, as I said previously, most authorities?and that is across the board in England, Wales, Europe and beyond?should be in a position to provide information on where most of the material goes although not necessarily in the level of detail required by the proposed Measure. Finding out which facility the material goes to is less easy. You may know the country but not precisely which factory it goes to, and it may be exported by one commodity broker to another who will then sell it on to a variety of facilities abroad. It is quite a complicated system.\n\n\n\tNick Ramsay: And that makes it impossible to track it.\n\n\n\tDr O?Brien: Yes.\n\n\n\tNick Ramsay: Thank you for indulging me, Chair.\n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: It is fine. \n\n\n\tHuw Lewis: I want to ask a question about the publication of statements that Nerys would require under section 1 of her proposed Measure, in the proposed section 55B that would be inserted into the Environmental Protection Act 1990 by it. She mentions that authorities should be required to publicise statements on their websites. First of all, do you think that that is a good, appropriate and effective way of doing things? I notice that, in your written evidence, you encourage the idea that we should publicise the statements by other mechanisms. Could you expand a little on that?\n\n\n\tMs de Longhi: Yes. It could be effective but only as long as local authorities provide the context of a statement?such as how this small proportion of municipal waste is handled, or how all municipal waste is managed?and give examples and case studies of how and where Welsh recyclate is used. \n\n\n\tGiven the age range and backgrounds of the people who might be interested in this information, we feel that web communication may not be the only appropriate means of publicising it. Some people might not have access to the web or some people may not want to access it through that route, so other means of communication may be necessary. We have suggested using local authority newsletters or local media. After submitting our written evidence, we talked about whether it was worth considering publishing this information in the Assembly?s annual municipal waste statement, as a means of sharing it on an all-Wales basis.\n\n\n\tHuw Lewis: The WLGA would say that that puts the costs up even more.\n\n\n\tMs de Longhi: Yes. \n\n\n\tHuw Lewis: You cannot speak for them, obviously. That proposed section 55B goes on to talk about the proximity principle and about the public making representations in respect of it. That would require us to assume that the public has a certain level of knowledge about all this. Do you accept that?\n\n\n\tMs de Longhi: Yes, we do accept that. The evidence base for this field is still emerging really, so it is hard to say whether anyone has full knowledge of it. Certain members of the public are very well informed; others, less so. However, it is quite complex, so I think that that is a fair point.\n\n\n\tHuw Lewis: We would be expecting people to have specific knowledge of the location of waste facilities and of any alternatives that might be available to fulfil the principle more closely, which is difficult to assume, is it not?\n\n\n\tMs de Longhi: It is difficult to assume that. Several consultations have involved the public through the regional waste planning process, and it depends on the degree to which the public has involved itself in those processes. Some will be very informed of the facilities available in their locality or region and others will not be, so it will be difficult to ensure a fully informed view, I think.\n\n\n\tHuw Lewis: Is the proximity principle worth all the fuss? Is Nerys not trying to deal with waste for recovery while the principle deals with waste for disposal? Are we not talking about two different things here?\n\n\n\tMs de Longhi: Yes, there is an element of logic there. In general, the proximity principle is a guiding principle. It should not be applied rigidly or hard and fast. It really does need to be looked at, to work out the most appropriate environmental option for each individual material and circumstance. It may well be more sensible to export certain wastes long distances to China, for example, rather than saying that we will deal with it locally when we have no recovery market so it could only go for disposal. That argument seems to be fairly obvious. We would not want to see planning authorities strictly bound to apply the proximity principle if there is evidence that that is not the most appropriate thing to do with a material.\n\n\n\tHuw Lewis: The whole point of this?and Nerys goes on to say it?is that local authorities should have regard to any representations that they receive, not just on the basis of the proximity principle but the whole waste recovery and disposal process. Do you think that Nerys?s wording, that local authorities should 'have regard to? public representation, is reasonable and effective? Is it really doing anything?\n\n\n\tMs de Longhi: We feel that they should have regard to the public?s opinion of these things as part of a broader and more strategic approach to waste planning. However, local authorities should be in a better position to consider regional and UK needs in their overall strategic decision. So, although it would be useful to have regard to these positions, we would not want to see local authorities slavishly bound to take public opinion to its nth degree when making their decisions.\n\n\n\tHuw Lewis: Nerys is at pains to point out that the final decision rests with the local authority, obviously. I have just one final question, Chair, if I may? \n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: Yes, of course.\n\n\n\tHuw Lewis: One thing that some of us have been worried about as regards the proximity principle and how it impact on Nerys?s proposal is the law of unintended consequences. I am sure that many members of the public would regard the proximity principle as a way of alerting people to just how close to their homes waste is being processed, when they would like it to be processed as far away from their homes as possible. Does that worry you?\n\n\n\tMs de Longhi: May I come in first, as I know that Cathy will have plenty to say on this? As the regulator of waste facilities, we are at pains to assure the public that having a waste facility close to their home is no bad thing. They are well regulated and well managed in the main. We do not want to cause the public undue concern that that is not the case, but we can see that that could be an unintended consequence of alerting the public in this way.\n\n\n\tDr O?Brien: We really do not feel that the public knows enough about what happens to waste, what the mechanisms are for the collection and management of materials, or the relative merits of different ways of dealing with it. The public consultations carried out in relation to regional waste plans have shown on two occasions that the public really does not fully understand this, and, as a result, is unable or unwilling to answer the consultation questions. That was actually a response option within the consultation process, because the local authorities involved were concerned about the level of knowledge. The resounding response from the public was, no, they did not really know enough.\n\n\n\tA small element of the public has strong opinions and will voice them at any opportunity, but the bulk of people do not really understand what happens to the material that they put out for the council to collect. \n\n\n\t10.20 a.m.\n\n\n\tThey can quite often draw incorrect conclusions from seeing what happens when the refuse collectors collect the recyclate. I had a recent conversation with a BBC Wales journalist about recycling and what happens in Wales and what happens to the waste, and the channel is considering doing a programme on it. That particular journalist had drawn the wrong conclusions from seeing how her recyclate was collected and the particular vehicle used by the council. The vehicle is called a kerbsider, which involves the operatives putting the waste into trays on the side of the vehicle that are then lifted up and over the top into the main body of the vehicle. She assumed that it was all going into the same compartment and that, therefore, all the sorting that the operatives had done in putting the different materials into different trays on the side of the vehicle was being negated by it being mixed in the vehicle. She did not know that there are separate compartments within that vehicle. Therefore, people can draw the wrong conclusions from just watching something without seeing the other end of it. If she had followed the vehicle to the council depot and watched it discharging the separate piles of different materials, she would have got a full impression, but most people are not aware of what happens.\n\n\n\tThere is not enough information out there. We do not know what forms people?s attitudes to having facilities in their communities, or what information might change that. More work is needed on this. It is something that we, as an organisation, have been working on with Waste Awareness Wales for a couple of years, trying to put together information in a way that people can understand and to provide that information to the local authorities for them to inform the public. However, more still needs to be done.\n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: Are you happy, Huw?\n\n\n\tHuw Lewis: I am content, thanks.\n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: Nick?\n\n\n\tEleanor Burnham: Thank you, Chair.\n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: No, Nick was next.\n\n\n\tEleanor Burnham: I was just going to ask?\n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: No, Nick indicated before you. Nick?\n\n\n\tEleanor Burnham: I do apologise, Chair.\n\n\n\tNick Ramsay: I have forgotten what I was going to ask now. Huw Lewis has hit on a very pertinent point. You say that a small minority of the public does know and understand these issues, but taht a lot of people do not understand. I was just wondering whether they want to understand. I believe that if you were to ask people, very few would now say they do not believe in recycling but believe in landfill, but, aside from that belief in recycling, do people really want to know the ins and outs exactly of where their waste is going or do they just want to have general confidence that what is being done is right? That goes to the heart of what this proposed Measure is trying to do. I would imagine that quite a number of people, if you invited them to see what happens to their waste at the other end of the cycle, would say, 'I do not want to go there; I have something else to do today.?\n\n\n\tMs de Longhi: That is a fair point. I think that the majority of people want some level of reassurance that the right thing is happening to their materials and that they are not religiously sorting stuff out only for it to end up in landfill, which, I emphasise, is not the case. However, most people are happy with that level of reassurance. I am not sure that they do particularly want to get involved. It is difficult for us because we are kind of waste anoraks and we find it all fascinating and interesting, and we would say, 'Of course we want to go and see everything?, but I am not sure that we are typical of the public on that point.\n\n\n\tDr O?Brien: There are a lot of urban myths that need to be counteracted, and that is why I have certain concerns about the proposed Measure focusing on that little bit of waste that is exported over long distances. I can see certain elements of the media making fun as a result of that particular issue, should it be publicised on its own, without the contextualisation.\n\n\n\tEleanor Burnham: Would you agree that, because we are opening up this interesting issue here, it is incumbent upon local authorities, whatever happens to this proposed Measure, to be able to succinctly and clearly in their publications, be they annual or otherwise, give a little r?sum? of what happens to their waste? I think that this has become a very contentious issue, and it was one of the first issues that I dealt with as an Assembly Member. There was a big issue related to leachate in a site above the village where I live. I was not directly involved, but it was a very contentious issue, and then, when the foot and mouth disease outbreak occurred, carcasses were being put in this particular spot. There was an enormous hue and cry. In a democracy, do you agree that whatever happens to this proposed Measure, we desperately need to explain to people what happens to their waste in a very clear manner, because the complexities of the dataflow system could send us all into the stratosphere?\n\n\n\tMs de Longhi: Yes, we would agree with you on that score; it does need to be explained very succinctly, so that the messages are conveyed in the right language for the right people. There are some examples on the websites of local authorities in England and Wales that refer to their recycling and what happens to it and how it is used. I think that those kind of positive messages about waste reinforce good culture as to how individuals look to handle their own materials.\n\n\n\tEleanor Burnham: I hope that the BBC, if it does produce this wonderful programme, tells it as it is, rather than having it portrayed by someone, as you say, who has come along without a modicum of the truth, but rather with the mythology.\n\n\n\tDr O?Brien: I think that the debunking of the mythology actually may have made the BBC think, 'Well, actually, this is not going to be the shock horror story that we wanted? sadly. That is the nature of the media unfortunately.\n\n\n\tEleanor Burnham: I am sure they are listening and watching.\n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: I would like to recap a little of what you have said. We are moving on to general information and awareness of the public, but do you think that this proposed Measure will help that or that information should be outwith this piece of legislation? Even if this proposed Measure does not go through, you are saying that we need much more information and that it is not down to this legislation to get that information out.\n\n\n\tMs de Longhi: In that this proposed Measure will make each local authority do something and present some information, it goes beyond where we are now with only some local authorities presenting certain bits of information. So, it will kind of produce a wider sharing of that information, which is useful. The proposed Measure does go some way to doing that, but we put it in the context of what we said earlier: we would like to see the focus upstream on the quality of recyclate rather than the final destination, and, again, in terms of the timing, it might be appropriate to consider a broader Measure further down the line.\n\n\n\tMohammad Asghar: In your evidence, your own words, you state that you want to see steps taken to\n\n\n\t'ensure that local authorities do not stop sending material overseas as a result of the difficulties in obtaining the data required, as this is against the core principles of the waste strategy.?\n\n\n\tThose are your words. Do you anticipate a reduction in the amount of waste that is sent abroad for recycling as a result of the proposed Measure?\n\n\n\tDr O?Brien: I certainly think that it is possible that local authorities may choose to cease using reprocessors abroad to avoid having to make a declaration as a result of the proposed Measure, in that they may be very concerned about public reaction to the fact that the waste that is collected in their locality is exported a long distance for recycling, although those same people would probably not have any problem with buying something made a long distance away. So, a lot of local authority officers have expressed to me that they worry about the public reaction, that they have had some experience of negative reaction and are concerned about it. I suspect that it may result in a reduction in the ability to recycle sometimes, because the size of the market for recyclate in the UK and Europe is limited for certain materials due to the fact that most of the industrial production happens a long way away. You need to have the industrial production in order to use the materials and in order to recycle them. So, it could result in less waste being recycled overall and it could result in waste not being sent from Wales to facilities further afield.\n\n\n\t10.30 a.m.\n\n\n\tThat material may have to be disposed of rather than recycled. That goes against the waste hierarchy, where we would prefer to see the materials being recycled, even if it is being recycled at distance. In overall carbon terms, it is better to recycle even at a distance than to dispose of the materials.\n\n\n\tMohammad Asghar: Do you share the concern raised in the evidence that, if passed, the proposed Measure could lead to a decrease in recycling levels due to negative media coverage, which would ultimately lead to an increase in landfill sites? If so, do you think that this could be prevented and how?\n\n\n\tDr O?Brien: It would be by making sure that the information published was properly contextualised and provided information on the whole range of materials and destinations that are used by that local authority, rather than just the specific spotlight on the small proportion that is exported. That will help to diffuse the potential negative effect. Without doing that I think that there is a very great danger that certain elements of the media will do a shock horror probe story, and that the public will start to get really worried that the materials that they are putting out for recycling are going a long way to be reprocessed. You can see the media story that would actually transpire as a result of that. That could have a negative impact on the public?s willingness to recycle, which would have a knock-on effect on the recycling rates overall, which is not where we want to go. That is not the intention of the proposed Measure but it is one of the unintended consequences that could happen as a result of the way that it is raised.\n\n\n\tMohammad Asghar: Thank you. You made a statement to my colleague that local authorities tend to lose track of their waste and you mentioned commodity brokers. I do not think that, if this proposed Measure is passed, they would keep track of where the waste is going and classification of the commodity brokers.\n\n\n\tDr O?Brien: They would probably not use the commodity brokers, but it would result in them not getting the best price for the materials that they have to offer. \n\n\n\tMohammad Asghar: So is there a financial impact?\n\n\n\tDr O?Brien: There is a financial impact.\n\n\n\tMs de Longhi: May I just come in on that? You asked what we could do to prevent negative media impact, which I am not sure that we tackled. Certainly the waste community, if you like?I include us, local authorities, the waste management industry and Waste Awareness Wales?is very conscious of this and is trying very hard to work with the media to ensure that there are positive stories about waste to counteract some of the negative stories that can be put out there. We see that as a priority.\n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: You suggest that the proposed Measure may encourage the public to accept recycling facilities within their own communities, saying that that:\n\n\n\t'would have a positive outcome in terms of the development of UK recycling infrastructure?. \n\n\n\tWhy do you think that that is the case?\n\n\n\tDr O?Brien: When you look at recycling infrastructure you have to look at facilities to bulk the material that comes from the household into an economic lorry load of a particular material to go to its destination for reprocessing. So, you need to have that type of facility. The public sometimes think that waste facilities mean landfill sites and things like that. They do not necessarily equate waste facilities with providing raw materials for industry. I think that understanding that may help things move forward.\n\n\n\tHowever, the way in which the proposed Measure is being drawn, just focusing on the export business, may not help quite so much, because it is focusing on the long-distance transfer rather than providing the raw material for the paper mill that provides the jobs in a certain community. Seeing it in those terms could help people to understand the integrated role of waste management in industrial production where it occurs in the UK, and also in industrial production where it occurs elsewhere in the world, although they may feel less well disposed to it because it is not providing local jobs.\n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: I do not think I am convinced on that one, and I am not sure where the local communities would be. I think that there needs to be a huge publicity campaign and a huge changing of mind, and if we are going to do that, we are talking about a huge amount of money being spent on trying to persuade people that they do not mind having this near to where they live. I know what you are saying, it is very laudable, but I just cannot see some constituents accepting that.\n\n\n\tDr O?Brien: I think that it is quite difficult. People see the word 'waste? and they think?yes. They do not always, necessarily, see waste as a pile of paper or a pile of glass that might be going back to make your jam jar for next week or the newspaper for tomorrow. So they see a negative thing rather than a positive thing and, yes, it will take a lot of time to turn that around, but the proposed Measure could, if it is taken slightly more broadly than just the exported material, help with public understanding of what happens to the material that they put out for recycling and that it does not just go to landfill via a back door. There is a lot of urban mythology about, with people thinking 'Oh, it is all very well the councils collecting all this stuff, but it is not actually recycled; it just goes to landfill at the end of the day?. A lot of people think that, and they do not have any evidence to show that it is not the case.\n\n\n\tEleanor Burnham: Do you think that, beyond the proposed Measure, whatever happens, we have a long hike in getting the media onside to help us? For instance, we are very privileged that we can visit the Shotton paper mill, yet you just said that the BBC did not run a story because it did not appear quite negative enough for them. That is quite sad.\n\n\n\tDr O?Brien: It is, yes.\n\n\n\tEleanor Burnham: So we have got to get the BBC on side, whatever happens with the proposed Measure.\n\n\n\tDr O?Brien: I do believe that a lot of work needs to be done with the media on these issues and it is a long hike uphill, I am afraid.\n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: You have answered our questions; thank you. If there is anything that you wish to add, perhaps you could put it in writing. We are running out of time here this morning?we have given you more of a work over than we had intended, I think. \n\n\n\tYou will have the opportunity of seeing a draft transcript before it is published, so that you can amend it as necessary. Thank you for coming this morning and for answering our questions so fully. I hope that we have not exhausted you too much.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n10.38 a.m.\n\nCylch\nCylch\n\n\n\t\t\t\tRosemary Butler: I welcome Mal Williams from Cylch. Thank you for coming this morning. You have seen the process, as you have been watching for the last hour or so. Mr Williams, you are chief executive officer of Cylch.\n\n\n\tMr Williams: Yes.\n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: I did have a look at your website, to find the membership of Cylch, but your website seems to be being redesigned or something.\n\n\n\tMr Williams: I am horrified to hear that, because yesterday it was working fine.\n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: I think that it said that it is being rebuilt. So it would be very helpful if you could let us have a list of your members at some point.\n\n\n\tMr Williams. I will do that; no problem.\n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: Thank you.\n\n\n\tIt would appear from your written evidence that you support the general principles of the proposed Measure. Can you confirm whether this is the case and, if so, can you explain what you think that the proposed Measure will provide that is not provided through existing legislation or by way of current practice?\n\n\n\tMr Williams: Yes, Chair, I can confirm that we support the broad approach that is being taken in this proposed Measure, on the basis that I do not think that the information that is around, as I have heard in the evidence and discussions in the last hour or so, has actually reached a stage where we can be satisfied that details and information are getting to the general public right across the board, it would seem. I would endorse Cathy?s constant references to urban mythology, but I would have a slightly different view about what is a myth and what is not a myth.\n\n\n\t10.40 a.m.\n\n\n\tWe come from the position of having been in the business of recycling for 20 to 30 years. I want to make that distinction because, for the last hour and a half, I have heard everybody talking about this as a waste issue. If you actually think about the semantics and the language that is used in relation to the waste issue, people think of waste as being waste and do not want to talk about it, and they think, 'Let us not go and visit it?, and all the rest of it. \n\n\n\tIn the UK, there are 1,600 community organisations that are delivering what I would call reuse and recycling facilities in their communities, and they have been doing so for quite a long time, and I cannot think of an occasion when an application to put a facility into a community was refused or even commented on by the local community. That did not happen when Newport Wastesavers set up a collection depot in Newport just alongside the transporter bridge, or when we moved into the Ty Coch Industrial Estate in Torfaen to operate a recycling facility. There was no comment whatsoever. The only question mark was about whether we had the right industrial permits and suchlike.\n\n\n\tThe mythology surrounds the fact that, at the moment, what we are actually doing is a significant management of change and it is probably, from my point of view, easier to try to explain all of this in the same way as I would explain the management of change from smoking to non-smoking. You cannot engage in that process without thinking right across the board about how you will affect people?s habits, because it is the habit of wasting that we are attacking. Unfortunately, we all have a vested interest in wasting. This has been referred to this morning as the out-of-sight, out-of-mind, or put-it-in-a-bin-and-get-rid-of-it, way of dealing with things in the old days. People are now being asked to do things with what they erstwhile call waste and, quite naturally, they are interested in that.\n\n\n\tRather than think of people?s curiosity as being something negative, I think of it as being something positive. So, in the case of someone like the person Cathy mentioned who saw the materials going up and over into the kerbsider and not knowing there were compartments there, I would take that person?s interest and complaint, if you like, as a matter of energy rather than disinterest. I want to know where it goes. I do want to know where it goes.\n\n\n\tThe other thing I wanted to say before I started?\n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: I am sorry, I think that you are going on to some of our questions, and I know that you are really enthusiastic about the subject, but we need to get specific answers to some of the questions. You can come back at the end if you think that we have not covered everything.\n\n\n\tMr Williams: Sure.\n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: We will move on to Huw.\n\n\n\tHuw Lewis: Good morning. When the Minister for the environment came to see us, she pretty much said, 'Look, you do not need this proposed Measure. All you need to do is improve the WasteDataFlow system and that would give you everything that Nerys Evans is proposing.? Is she right?\n\n\n\tMr Williams: She is right to say that if you could improve the WasteDataFlow system, you would access the information. The snag is, as I am sitting here giving evidence, that the WasteDataFlow system has not produced the documentation I have been waiting for for two years following the RPS report published in 2006-07 on the 2006-07 municipal waste data.\n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: What is the RPS report?\n\n\n\tMr Williams: It was an independent report commissioned by the Welsh Assembly Government.\n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: Can you explain what RPS is?\n\n\n\tMr Williams: Surely. It is an independent consultancy, I hope. It was commissioned by the Assembly Government to produce a report that compared the costs of kerbside collection and other issues. It was a detailed report that was not available to the general public, and not available to me, because it contained commercially confidential information, but a summary report was published in August 2007 covering the 2006-07 data, and that showed a vast range of costs associated with the collection systems operated by local authorities in Wales. It highlighted a huge range of costs varying from ?35 a tonne to an average of ?250 a tonne.\n\n\n\tObviously, we were interested in that data, so we asked questions about it, and we asked whether or not the data would be available for last year and this year, as two subsequent years. As I understand it, that work has been done, but the data has not been produced and is unavailable because it is not accurate. In answer to your question, even the waste nerds, as Cathy referred to us, cannot get hold of the information that we need to make sensible decisions about various things to do with recycling.\n\n\n\tHuw Lewis: We have talked about the non-nerds in society this morning and what kind of involvement they have as regards being engaged with what happens in terms of waste processing. Do you think that this proposed Measure is a good and effective way of promoting engagement and curiosity among people out there who are not generally waste nerds?\n\n\n\tMr Williams: That is an interesting one for me, because, as well as being the chief executive officer of Cylch, representing community organisations in Wales, I chair the Campaign for Real Recycling. I mention that because that means I sit around the table with all the major UK reprocessors of paper, glass, plastics and suchlike on a monthly basis. They tell me two things, the first of which is the fact that they cannot get the quality of recyclate that they need in this country. Shotton and Aylesford paper mills, for example, are prepared to confess?quietly?that they have to import newsprint from overseas because they cannot get the kind of quality they need in this country. That hides the fact that there are two systems of collection, one of which produces waste, which causes problems. That problem is overcome because the material, due to its quality, has to go overseas for export. So, we have this business about the marketplace being an ideal place where prices adjust; prices do adjust, but they adjust according to the quality of the material that is available.\n\n\n\tIt just happens that the three major paper mills in this country require a certain quality. It is specified, and you can find that specification by looking into the journals, and it is usually a couple of per cent of contrary materials in any load that arrives at the mills. Increasingly, as recycling has increased over the last three or four years, the contamination rates in the loads arriving at Shotton, at Aylesford and at Abitibi has increased to such an extent that they have had to do one of two things: they have had to either downgrade the price they give for the loads and send them off for secondary sorting before they can accept them, or reject the loads completely. I am more familiar with Aylesford because Chris White from Aylesford sits on the committee, and he tells me that he has to reject a significant tonnage on a daily basis from local authorities all across the UK. So, it is happening not just in Wales, but right across the UK. That is a ridiculous situation, and one which then touches upon why people are interested in the fact that their paper reaches China and why they are a bit horrified to see that the Chinese and Philippine processes are, let us say, slightly less than environmentally friendly, and, even in the mainstream, it is less environmentally friendly, let alone what happens at the outskirts.\n\n\n\tHuw Lewis: Do you think that this proposed Measure?let us say that it is passed?is going to encourage the good citizens of Neath Port Talbot to go out and demand more and better recycling from their local authority?\n\n\n\tMr Williams: That is a good question. I think that it would inform them as to what a good recycling facility is. That is the point. From my experience of talking to people across the board about recycling, as opposed to waste problems?let us make that distinction?and from the surveys done since 1990, I would say that everyone wants to recycle, as I think was mentioned earlier. Of those people who respond to the surveys, 90 per cent say, 'Give us a good system and we will use it?. However, if they then have a good system and are using it, but they think it is being abused, be that through Chinese children being abused or through the waste going to landfill rather than where they thought it was going, it is only reasonable that they should have the information to be able to find that out.\n\n\n\tOn the commodity issue, this market is distinct from other markets in that it is not a market as yet, given that it requires public funding to keep it going. The material is made available by public subsidy and, as council tax payers, we are entitled to slightly different treatment than would otherwise be the case.\n\n\n\t10.50 a.m.\n\n\n\tMohammad Asghar: Mal, several organisations have expressed disappointment that the proposed Measure applies only to municipal waste and does not extend to all waste sectors. Given that you emphasise in your evidence the importance of targeting all waste, do you wish to comment on that?\n\n\n\tMr Williams: Sure. You have to start by realising that the change process that we are engaged in is really an educational process for each individual. Everybody lives in a house, so it is municipal waste that is targeted. I do not think that the information that you give people would change radically depending on whether you think of them as wearing a suit, or as an industrialist or a commercial person. You are just saying that you want them to put materials out separately so that we can keep them clean and sell them on, whether that is office paper, the paper that comes out of your household or your kitchen, or whatever. So, that is the first thing. We have to start somewhere with limited budgets, so starting with municipal waste seems like a good idea.\n\n\n\tInterestingly, the percentages of recyclable materials that occur in the municipal waste stream are fairly similar to those occurring in commercial and industrial waste streams. So, if the message is taken on board by a householder, that person would apply it in the office or factory, and it would have a greater effect. Having said that, up to date, we have applied public money to public areas of concern and legislated for areas of concern, which are limited to municipal waste. You need to modify the messages, although I think that the industrialists have spotted it. As far as they are concerned, waste is an inefficiency and so reducing it is a good idea. There is a middle area: offices, factories, universities and public buildings perhaps. Maybe they are not quite as concerned about the cost-benefit analysis as somebody sitting in an office, but they still need to ask their people, 'Now that you have your home sorted, how about the office??. So, the message needs to change a little, but the information that you are talking about is the same. The detail should be there in the information.\n\n\n\tMohammad Asghar: My second question is about the timing of this proposed Measure. You may be aware that, if made, the proposed legislative competence Order on environmental protection and waste management would provide an opportunity to bring forward a Measure that deals with the provision of information on recyclates across all waste sectors. In view of that, it has been suggested by the Welsh Local Government Association that the proposed Measure is premature. What are your comments on that?\n\n\n\tMr Williams: When is that proposed Order likely to come into force? I think that it has disappeared into a void. I have been watching it with some interest, waiting for it to reappear, and so we must do everything that we can now. If we can do this, let us do it and not wait for that one. If that one arrives as well, that will be great?even more legislation. It is the role of legislators to legislate, and we need to legislate on these issues.\n\n\n\tMohammad Asghar: Thank you. In evidence to the committee, the WLGA also asserted that local authorities are already providing as much information as possible on the end destination of their recyclates via the WasteDataFlow system. In view of that, why do you think the section 55A(5) requirement is necessary?\n\n\n\tMr Williams: If it becomes necessary, there will be less room for wriggling. I know that some local authorities across the UK?and I am not specifying Welsh local authorities particularly, although they are included in this?are tacitly aware of the fact that they can make their recyclate disappear into commercial voids to make their recycling figures look better. In other words, they can be sent to secondary material recovery facilities, or tertiary ones, in some cases. There is plenty of proof of that around the place. What is not generally known?and I know it because I sit around the table with reprocessors, as I mentioned earlier?is that even when the materials are accepted at the paper mill, at Shotton, for example, or at the glass factory, a percentage of the accepted material is waste. Now, I think that that should be discounted against the recycling rate. We are not in the business of creating recycling rates, and we are very proud of the fact that we have moved from 3 per cent to the announcement this week of 41 per cent, which is brilliant, frankly, and we can all take some pride in that. However, we do not want those figures to be in any sense cheating, do we? We want them to be real. I can tell you that there is probably a discount of 5 or 6 per cent that we could apply to that almost across the board in the UK, so you have to ask why we are allowing it by not making such an adjustment.\n\n\n\tThe answer to that is quite complex and is to do with the marketplace that you were asking about earlier. I think that, for the reasons mentioned earlier, because there is public money involved in this marketplace, there is a way in which you can insist on that information being given. Another bit of mythology is that there are not that many contracts between local authorities and reprocessors. Typically, there is in the paper industry, and they do sign contracts. I know that the big paper reprocessors obtain 85 per cent or thereabouts of their tonnage every year on a contractual basis, but that is usually a lower and fixed price. Typically, it is ?50 or ?60 a tonne for paper at the moment, but today?s price might well be ?70, ?80 or ?90, or it could even go up to ?110 or ?120, as it did last October. That spot price can fall through the floor, which is what causes the problems. The contracts that we are talking about, and which you were talking about earlier, were the collection contracts, and they tend to be for between three and seven years.\n\n\n\tSo, there are not many contracts between local authorities and reprocessors for the supply of material, paper being the slight exception, and maybe aluminium in some cases, and even those contracts are subject to a lot of variation.\n\n\n\tMohammad Asghar: Thank you very much, Mal. I am asking you about a plant and you are giving me the brief of the garden. Do you consider that the aim of the proposed Measure could be achieved by improving the way in which the information that is currently collected is made available to the public? If not, why not?\n\n\n\tMr Williams: Sorry, can you just give me the beginning of that question again?\n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: I think that what Mr?Asghar was referring to was that you are giving us a huge brief. We just want to try to trim it down a bit, if we can. Thank you very much.\n\n\n\tMr Williams: Yes, I apologise. I will try to focus.\n\n\n\tMohammad Asghar: Do you want me to repeat it again?\n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: No, I think that he got the question; it was just the remark at the beginning.\n\n\n\tMohammad Asghar: No, a specific answer, please, because there are a lot of other colleagues here, and you are answering their questions.\n\n\n\tMr Williams: Okay, I am sorry.\n\n\n\tMohammad Asghar: Thanks.\n\n\n\tMr Williams: Sorry, could you ask the beginning of that question again?\n\n\n\tMohammad Asghar: Do you consider that the aim of the proposed Measure could be achieved by improving the way in which the information that is currently collected is made available to the public? If not, why not?\n\n\n\tMr Williams: I do agree that it could be, and the agency answered that question quite well by saying that there are various means of communicating such information that are not used at the moment but which could be. For example, the Assembly could publish the figures. We could be publishing the figures. They could be on every website of every member of ours as a routine matter. The general public does want to know in that kind of detail and regularly, and also how one year?s figures compare with last year?s, and how neighbouring authorities compare, and all that sort of thing. It is the hot 100, or The X Factor kind of thing that the public likes to get into. That kind of information does attract attention.\n\n\n\tMohammad Asghar: Thank you.\n\n\n\tAnn Jones: The committee has received evidence from a number of sources, including the Environment Agency, as you heard earlier. Its representatives raised concerns about the ability of local authorities to obtain the information required under the proposed Measure. You seem to suggest that there is no reason why local authorities could not easily obtain it. Do you have evidence to back that up?\n\n\n\tMr Williams: I have talked to the reprocessors about this and, if the materials are being collected and recycled in the UK, and most of the waste from Wales is, at the moment, there is no problem. The duty of care certification that was referred to is a paper trail that can go both ways. Let us be quite candid about it and say that there are cheques that come up this way and paper invoices that go down that way. So, it is not just a weighbridge ticket; it is also a financial arrangement that could be audited.\n\n\n\t11.00 a.m.\n\n\n\tYou could say that, because there is public money involved, we have a right to audit that, no matter who is doing it, and also the choice of the broker could be limited to licensed brokers who will give that information. I think that that ought to be the case.\n\n\n\tAnn Jones: Thank you. Your evidence refutes the suggestion that 'commercially confidential? will prevent local authorities from obtaining the required information from private waste companies, and then, contrary to that, you suggest that the proposed Measure will prevent private companies from withholding information on such grounds. Can you explain why you believe that to be the case?\n\n\n\tMr Williams: The case at the moment is that 'commercial confidentiality? is used as a smokescreen for not being able to get the information. I would deny that; I think that you can get hold of the information if you insist on it when you supply the material. There might be a very small cost, but I do not think that the marketplace will develop as we want it to if we do not put some sort of control on that anyway. That is why we have the aforementioned insistence on, 'I can only give you this material if you give me a duty of care certificate, plus I want to know where you are passing it on to?.\n\n\n\tAnn Jones: You state in your evidence that local authorities can use their procurement and supply chain powers to insist on accountability. Can you briefly tell me what you mean by that?\n\n\n\tMr Williams: If the local authority is collecting the materials now, it is selling into the marketplace and collecting the money for that. That is a contract that is worth a lot to people who have recycling contracts or waste contracts or who are in waste contracting. That procurement power is absolute, because you can write clauses into those contracts that require the contractor to do whatever you want.\n\n\n\tAnn Jones: The Welsh Local Government Association has raised a concern that private waste companies may be reluctant to enter into contracts with local authorities if, as a condition of a contract, they are expected to provide the necessary information needed to meet the requirements of this proposed Measure. What is your view on that?\n\n\n\tMr Williams: I would leave it to competition. There will be competitors that will do that.\n\n\n\tAnn Jones: All right. Section 55A(8) and 55A(9) cover instances where information required under the proposed Measure is not held by or available to an authority. In such instances, an authority must take reasonable steps to obtain that information and include details of it in any statement. What is your view on that provision?\n\n\n\tMr Williams: That one does sound like a get-out clause, does it not? My view on it would be to eliminate it. The word 'reasonable?, or anything like it, is open to interpretation and probably endless debate and, therefore, is probably not a good idea.\n\n\n\tAnn Jones: Do you believe that that is a danger to undermining the effectiveness of any proposed Measure?\n\n\n\tMr Williams: Yes. If you are serious about getting the data, you should be serious about getting the data.\n\n\n\tAnn Jones: Thank you. Still on information to the public, how meaningful do you think the information required by section 55A(5) will be to the public?\n\n\n\tMr Williams: That is an interesting one. It depends. Right across the board, there is a different level of interest, but I think that, overall, the greater the detail, the better. I do not think that there is any such thing as sufficient information on this score, as probably evidenced by the fact that we are sitting here talking about this, 20 years into trying to convert from waste to recycling. However, there is still a huge amount of doubt about all the little tiny things. So the more sophisticated the data, the better the communication of the information to the general public, the better we will move forward with this.\n\n\n\tAnn Jones: Do you think that the proposed Measure should be amended to take those two paragraphs out?\n\n\n\tMr Williams: I would not put the word 'reasonable? in to provide any get-out clauses, and I cannot think what you are referring to in the second bit.\n\n\n\tAnn Jones: It is about the danger of reducing down, is it not, of weakening the proposed Measure?\n\n\n\tMr Williams: Yes, I would not weaken it.\n\n\n\tAnn Jones: You would want to see it go a lot further.\n\n\n\tMr Williams: Yes.\n\n\n\tAnn Jones: Thank you. \n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: Before we move on to Eleanor, I would just remind you that we are talking about waste for export, which is slightly different to some of the evidence that you have been giving. Eleanor, I am sure that you want to come back on Shotton paper mill.\n\n\n\tEleanor Burnham: Yes, thank you, Chair. You are very kind.\n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: However, we are talking about waste for export.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tEleanor Burnham: Yr wyf wedi ymweld ??r felin bapur sawl gwaith, ac yr wyf yn pryderu am y ffaith eich bod yn dal i honni ei bod yn methu ? chael deunydd ailgylchu o?r ansawdd gorau. Beth yw?r rheswm am hynny, a sut mae gwella?r ansawdd?\tEleanor Burnham: I have visited the paper mill quite a few times, and I am still concerned about what you said about its being unable to get the best quality recyclate. Why is that and how can the quality be improved? \n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tRosemary Butler: I presume that you are talking about export here.\n\n\n\tEleanor Burnham: Yes.\n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: You might like to have a conversation with Mr Williams afterwards about that, because I am sure it is very interesting, but can we just stick to the? \n\n\n\tEleanor Burnham: I just thought that that was a very important part of what we are discussing.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSymudaf ymlaen at fy nghwestiynau ffurfiol. Yr ydych wedi s?n am gyhoeddi datganiad a sylwadau gan y cyhoedd, ond a yw gwneud hynny ar wefan awdurdodau yn ffordd briodol ac/neu effeithiol o gynnwys cymunedau yn y mater pwysig hwn? A oes systemau eraill y gellid eu defnyddio i roi cyhoeddusrwydd i?r datganiad, yn eich barn chi?\tI will move on to my formal questions. You have mentioned the publication of a statement and public representations, but is doing that on an authority?s website an appropriate and/or effective way of engaging communities in this important issue? Are there any other mechanisms that could be used to publicise the statement, in your opinion?\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMr Williams: Yes, along with other issues to do with websites, I think that there should be a standard formatting requirements for websites, so that when you go looking for information like the address, for example, of the organisation concerned, you find it on the front page.\n\n\n\tEleanor Burnham: As well as a list of members.\n\n\n\tMr Williams: A list of members, yes. When you go to look at the data, it would be interesting to make sure that there was a statement on exact destinations of materials.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tEleanor Burnham: Mae?r pwyllgor wedi derbyn tystiolaeth sy?n awgrymu bod ffyrdd mwy effeithiol ac uniongyrchol o gael cymunedau i ymwneud ag ailgylchu na?r Mesur arfaethedig hwn, er enghraifft ymgynghori rhagweithiol, mynd i?r afael ? newid gwasanaethau a chyfleusterau newydd. Beth yw eich barn chi ar hynny?\tEleanor Burnham: The committee has received evidence to suggest that there are more effective and direct ways of involving communities in recycling than the proposed Measure, such as proactive consultation, dealing with service changes and new facilities. What are your views on this?\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMr Williams: Yes, for sure, there are other ways of engaging communities, and one thing that the community sector has been quite good at is engaging communities and representing those very local interests without any fuss and without any controversy. I do not think that there has been any particular kind of worry about what was happening. We have over 1,000 organisations, as I mentioned earlier, across the country that are operating in reuse, recycling, composting, waste reduction and all sorts of areas, and have been doing for the last 20 or 30 years without there being a single headline?okay, there have been one or two headlines, but they have been few and far between?and there has been nothing to worry about. \n\n\n\tOne thing that we have said right from the very beginning of this conversion from waste to recycling is that a significant proportion of your efforts should be applied to making sure that the public are informed about what you are doing well in advance of you doing anything. One thing that has happened across the UK is that local authorities have failed to heed that advice, and have just simply given out the equipment and a leaflet and maybe put a few articles in the newspaper in the hope that all the residents will suddenly, through osmosis, pick up all the information that is needed. A lot of the problems that have occurred right across the board have occurred because that particular message did not get through.\n\n\n\tIt is interesting to me to note now that Waste Awareness Wales?I know that there are lots of contracts out at the moment that involve door-knocking in various places to try to increase participation rates?is finally knocking on people?s doors and talking to people, which is perhaps what should have been done in the first place, I would argue. \n\n\n\t11.10 a.m.\n\n\n\tIn answer to the question, you cannot do too much to communicate with people, and we should think about a 10-year plan or a five-year plan and make sure that we budget for that, because it will reap the dividend. It is an investment in change.\n\n\n\tEleanor Burnham: Whose responsibility is it? We heard earlier from the Environment Agency that a BBC programme was being made about the worst excesses and the mythology, but how can this get to the nub of the communities and who should be doing that?\n\n\n\tMr Williams: I think that that is part of this change. We are investing in completely new systems for the collection of materials. When those new systems are introduced, there should be a budget attached to them as part of the contract, if you like, to make sure that the communication gets out to the people who are going to use it.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tEleanor Burnham: Pa mor resymol yw disgwyl i?r cyhoedd wneud sylwadau, o ystyried yr egwyddor agosatrwydd? A ydych yn derbyn bod hyn yn tybio bod gan y cyhoedd lefel neilltuol o wybodaeth nid yn unig am reoli gwastraff yn gyffredinol, ond am leoliad cyfleusterau gwastraff yn fwy penodol?\tEleanor Burnham: Thank you very much. How reasonable is it to expect the public to make representations, bearing in mind the proximity principle? Do you accept that this assumes that the public has a certain level of knowledge not only about waste management generally, but about the location of waste facilities more specifically?\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMr Williams: Here we come across this split between waste and resource recovery facilities again. As soon as you mention that there is a waste facility coming into an area, the alarms go off: 'It?s an incinerator, my God. Make phone calls to Friends of the Earth. Get the community organised? and all the rest of it. If it is a recycling facility, for some reason no-one seems to take much notice. If it is a furniture project reusing furniture and bulky household waste, no-one seems to take much notice. If it is an industrial unit being converted to Torfaen recycling or Cardiff recycling or this, that and the other, no-one seems to take much notice?that is the case.\n\n\n\tI would ask you to think below that statement. What is it that does not cause alarm to the community when you are talking about improving facilities in order to improve their environment and bring benefit to the community? The key to that probably lies in the fact of what I have just said?the community benefit. If people perceive that there is no harm coming to them in their locality, then they will not react negatively. If they see it as a benefit, they will react fairly positively. That depends on the campaign that you have put on the table before you introduce a new facility. In our experience, when we say we are moving from a waste facility to a recycling facility, there has not been any problem.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tEleanor Burnham: Y cwestiwn olaf gennyf fi yw: o gofio?r cymhlethdodau sydd ynghlwm ? gwneud penderfyniadau ynghylch rheoli gwastraff, pa mor resymol ydyw i awdurdodau lleol ystyried unrhyw sylwadau a wneir gan y cyhoedd wrth wneud trefniadau ar gyfer y dyfodol mewn perthynas ag adfer gwastraff?\tEleanor Burnham: The final question from myself: given the complexities involved in making decisions on waste management, how reasonable is it for local authorities to have regard to any representations made by the public when making future arrangements in relation to the recovery of waste?\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMr Williams: Is the general public a bunch of noddies or does it understand stuff? We have had endless arguments about this. It is amazing that Tesco expects people to come into its stores and choose between 20,000 different products and labelling that goes into endless degrees of detail about what to buy for their own satisfaction, and yet when it comes to deciding which of three bins I should put this piece of waste in, all of a sudden they are incapable?a bit like a man incapable of operating a washing machine or a golf cart. I find that amazing. I will answer the question in a second. \n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: I would rather you answered it now than in a second. Can you be specific about the question Eleanor Burnham was asking?\n\n\n\tMr Williams: Yes. Now I have forgotten what the question was. I was there a second ago.\n\n\n\tEleanor Burnham: Given the complexities involved in making decisions on waste management, how reasonable is it for local authorities to have regard to any representations made by the public when making future arrangements in relation to the recovery of waste?\n\n\n\tMr Williams: It is essential that local authorities take full regard of any representation made by any member of the general public, under any circumstances to do with any facility that is going to involve them as a participant. How can you expect individuals in Splott, Tremorfa, Cyncoed or Lisvane to know what they are doing unless someone explains that to them when they request an explanation? It is a simple democratic point.\n\n\n\tNick Ramsay: Just a couple of questions about the consequences of the proposed Measure. The WLGA said that it was afraid that the proposed Measure could create a perception among the public that exporting recyclate for recovery is wrong and of no benefit, and that using local facilities is always the best option. I would like your comments on that. Do you think that there is a possibility of damaging public confidence in the whole process? Secondly, the Environment Agency?which has representatives here today?has suggested that the proposed Measure may encourage the public to accept recycling facilities within their own communities, which would have a positive outcome. I would be interested to know what you think about that as well.\n\n\n\tMr Williams: The answer is along the same lines. If the general public has been informed that this is what is going to happen and these are the likely consequences it will understand. In other words, if people are told that the system will be changing to collect materials and that those materials are going to be kept clean and sold to the marketplace, which will keep the costs down for them as council tax payers, as well as reduce the environmental impact?because people calculate that; if they have been told that it will also bring social benefit through the creation of local jobs and so on, they will understand. If you tell them, 'Whoops, we have had a bit of a downturn in the marketplace in India because of a tsunami or something or other, and we have had to sell stuff to China this month?, they will understand that that is perfectly okay. It depends what you say to them upfront.\n\n\n\tI would say that most of the materials that are gathered in this country could be recycled in this country at this moment. Even with projected tonnages, there is plenty of capacity. We are not short of capacity to recycle materials, and that is without building new facilities. The whole business of export?and this is why I keep going back to this one, Chair, and I apologise for that?is to do with the choice of collection system which ends up with local authorities collecting materials which have to be called waste, because they are mixed materials, and the only market that will touch them is the market overseas. That is the bit of mythology that I am concerned with, and the reprocessors likewise. Last year it got to the stage where the very existence of reprocessing in this country was under threat because of the lack of material available for those large reprocessors and the price that they were having to pay for the materials that they were collecting. We were in danger of losing our own reprocessing industry.\n\n\n\tNick Ramsay: In your evidence, you suggest that the proposed Measure could potentially cause a backlash. What did you mean by that?\n\n\n\tMr Williams: When I read that last night to remind myself what I said three months ago, I said, 'Backlash? Where did that come from??. If you end up with negativity, that would be, as I have explained, because of poor information going out rather than inadequate information going out, or not enough information going out rather than too much, and people might get demotivated. They might simply feel dispirited because they are taking all this trouble to sort out the different materials and see it go into one compartment on a truck?and it does go into one compartment in some places in Wales?and therefore complaints are to be expected. If people have taken the trouble to sort out the waste and they see it going into one compartment, then they are naturally going to think, 'Well, that is not going to be recycled now. They are undoing what I have just done? because the authority is not explaining that it is changing its system or whatever. So yes, there is a danger of that backlash, and it would demotivate me, frankly. So that has to be taken into account, but I do not think that is general.\n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: We have asked you a lot of questions and you have answered them very freely, thank you very much. As you heard earlier, we will let you have a copy of the report and you can make any comments on that before it goes public. Thank you very much for coming. Will you let us know who your members are?\n\n\n\tMr Williams: I will.\n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: Also you said that you chair the Independent Recycling something.\n\n\n\tMr Williams: The Campaign for Real Recycling. It is like the Campaign for Real Ale, only it is for recycling. It has the same thrust.\n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: Thank you very much for that, and thank you very much for giving evidence. It was most interesting.\n\n\n\tMr Williams: Thank you, Chair.\n\n\n\tRosemary Butler: I think that brings today?s business to a close. Just to remind people that we do have a meeting next week. We have a pre-meeting at 8.45 a.m. and the meeting will start at 9 a.m. where the Minister will give evidence.

Ers hynny mae wedi rhannu ei hamser rhwng Rhydychen a gwahanol diroedd pellennig eraill, yn bennaf yr Almaen. Graddiodd mewn ieithoedd modern ym Mhrifysgol Rhydychen.\n\n\n\nGyda'i chwaer Angharad mae Mererid yn gyd-awdur dau lyfr antur aml-ddewis, Trwy Ogof Arthur a Melltith Madog a gyhoeddwyd gan y Lolfa yn 1986 a 1989. Yn ogystal mae'n awdur dwy gyfrol o gerddi. Cyhoeddwyd y gyntaf, Darluniau, a ennillodd iddi Fedal Lenyddiaeth Eisteddfod yr Urdd, yn 1988. Ymddangosodd ei hail gyfrol, Caneuon o Ben Draw'r Byd, yng nghyfres Beirdd Answyddogol y Lolfa yn 1996. Tardda llawer o'r Caneuon o Ben Draw'r Byd o gyfnod hir a dreuliodd Mererid yng Ngogledd Llydaw. \"Penn ar Bed\" - Pen Draw'r Byd - yw enw'r ardal honno ac mae'r cerddi'n ymdrin ag argraffiadau ac eiliadau yno. Amcan y gyfrol hon oedd cyflwyno cerddi syml - neu'n hytrach ganeuon - allent gyfleu amrantiad ar amrantiad, fel yn y caneuon o'r gyfrol sy'n dilyn. \n\n\n\nMae Mererid hefyd wedi cyhoeddi beirniadaeth lenyddol a diwylliannol yn Gymraeg ar gyfer cylchgronnau megis Tu Chwith; ac yn Saesneg mae wedi cyhoeddi ar agweddau ar fytholeg a straeon tylwyth teg mewn llenyddiaeth Ewropeaidd gyfoes.\n\nGwefan\n\n\n\nDarganfuwyd 3 cofnod.\n\n\t\n\n\n£4.50 \tCaneuon o Ben Draw'r Byd   (Mererid Puw Davies)\n\nAil gyfrol barddoniaeth Mererid Puw Davies.

So yes.\n\nI was suggesting this place because I've been here before, and it's awesome.\nI don't want to kid on anyone that this is a conference it will be climbing mountains (If you want to), networking and drinking warm cans of lager.\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRe: PirateCamp?\n\n\t\t\t\tPosted: Wed May 26, 2010 8:13 pm\n\n\t\t\t\tby duke\n\n\t\t\t\tepriezka wrote:Erm... you guys always ask such good and awkward questions... as so often I'm waiting on approval to make something happen...

CYD-DESTUN \nYr Ysgol a���i Blaenoriaethau \nMae'r ysgol wedi'i lleoli ym mhentref Blaendulais yng nghanol Cwm Dulais, tua deng milltir \ni'r gogledd o Gastell Nedd. Cymuned lofaol brysur oedd Cwm Dulais yn y gorffennol, ond \nmae bellach yn ardal wledig yn bennaf. Adeiladwyd yr ysgol wreiddiol ymhell dros gan \nmlynedd yn ��l a chafodd yr ysgol Gymraeg ei sefydlu ym 1961. Dros y blynyddoedd mae \nrhannau o'r ysgol wedi cael eu hadnewyddu a'u gwella'n gyson ac yn ystod y flwyddyn \nddiwethaf crewyd dwy swyddfa newydd ynghyd �� derbynfa. \nRoedd 130 o ddisgyblion ar y gofrestr pan wnaed yr arolygiad, yn cynnwys 25 o blant oed \nmeithrin sy'n mynychu'r ysgol am hanner amser. Daw mwyafrif y disgyblion o Flaendulais ei \nhun, a phentrefi cyfagos Creunant, Onllwyn, Pantyffordd, Dyffryn Cellwen a Banwen. Er \nbod rhannau o'r cwm yn bur ddifreintiedig, yn ��l yr ysgol daw mwyafrif y disgyblion o \ngefndiroedd sy heb fod yn freintiedig na difreintiedig. Mae tua 12% o'r disgyblion �� hawl i \nbrydau bwyd rhad ac am ddim ac fe nodir 23 (21%) fel rhai sydd ag anghenion addysgol \narbennig (AAA) gan gynnwys un y gwnaethpwyd datganiad AAA ar ei gyfer. Rhyw chwech \ny cant o'r disgyblion sy'n dod o gartrefi lle siaredir Cymraeg fel iaith gyntaf.  \nMae nodau ac amcanion yr ysgol yn dynodi ei bwriadau, yn eu plith, hyrwyddo datblygiad \nesthetig, ysbrydol, moesol, cymdeithasol ac addysgol y disgyblion, a hybu rhagoriaeth.  \nMae blaenoriaethau'r ysgol am y flwyddyn gyfredol ac ymlaen i'r ddwy flynedd ddilynol yn \ncael eu rhestru yn y Cynllun Datblygu Ysgol (CDY). Ym mysg y rhai ar gyfer 2001-2002 \nmae: codi safonau'n gyffredinol mewn iaith, gan gynnwys hybu a gwobrwyo y defnydd o'r \nGymraeg o amgylch yr ysgol, sicrhau bod yr agwedd ymchwiliol yn cael sylw priodol mewn \ngwyddoniaeth a pharhau i gryfhau'r system fonitro yn yr ysgol. Hefyd, sefydlodd yr ysgol yn \nddiweddar system o osod targedau cyflawniad i'r holl ddisgyblion yn ychwanegol at y \ntargedau meintiol penodol a osodir i'r diben o godi safonau cyrhaeddiad y disgyblion yn y \nprofion cenedlaethol ar ddiwedd Cyfnod Allweddol (CA)2.  \nArolygwyd yr ysgol ddiwethaf yn nhymor yr hydref 1996. Mae'r pennaeth wedi bod yn ei \nswydd ers Medi 2000. \n2. PRIF GANFYDDIADAU \nPrif Ganfyddiadau���r Adroddiad \nMae safonau cyflawniad yn foddhaol neu well mewn 94% o'r gwaith; maent yn dda mewn \n39% o'r gwaith. \n��� Mae ansawdd cyffredinol y ddarpariaeth addysgol ar gyfer plant dan bump yn briodol \ni'w hanghenion. Mae'r safonau yn y chwe maes dysgu fel a ganlyn: \nSgiliau iaith, llythrennedd a chyfathrebu Boddhaol \nDatblygiad personol a chymdeithasol Da \nDatblygiad mathemategol Boddhaol \nGwybodaeth a dealltwriaeth o'r byd Da \nDatblygiad corfforol Boddhaol \nDatblygiad creadigol Da \n \n1\n      \n \n��� Yn CA1 a CA2, mae safonau cyflawniad y disgyblion yng ngwahanol bynciau'r \nCwricwlwm Cenedlaethol (CC) ac addysg grefyddol fel a ganlyn: \nPwnc CA1 CA2 \nCymraeg Boddhaol Boddhaol \nSaesneg - Da \nMathemateg Da Da \nGwyddoniaeth Boddhaol Boddhaol \nDylunio a thechnoleg Da Da \nTechnoleg gwybodaeth Da Da \nHanes Da Da \nDaearyddiaeth Boddhaol Boddhaol \nCelf Da Da \nCerddoriaeth Da Da \nAddysg gorfforol Boddhaol Da \nAddysg grefyddol Da Da \n \n��� Yng nghanlyniadau'r ysgol yn asesiadau'r CC 2001, roedd canran y disgyblion a \ngyrhaeddodd lefel 2 mewn llafaredd, darllen ac ysgrifennu Cymraeg, ac mewn \nmathemateg, yn gyfforddus uwch na'r ffigurau cenedlaethol. Yn CA2, roedd y \ncanlyniadau mewn Saesneg a mathemateg gryn dipyn yn is na'r rhai cenedlaethol a'r \nrhai mewn Cymraeg a gwyddoniaeth yn llawer is.  \n��� Yn y sgiliau allweddol ar draws y cwricwlwm, mae'r plant dan bump oed yn cyflawni \nsafonau boddhaol mewn llythrennedd a rhifedd a safonau da yn eu defnydd o \ndechnoleg gwybodaeth a chyfathrebu (TGCh). Yn CA1, mae safonau a gyflawnir yn \nGymraeg mewn gwrando a darllen yn dda ac maent yn foddhaol mewn siarad ac \nysgrifennu. Yn CA2, mae'r safonau a gyflawnir mewn siarad, darllen ac ysgrifennu \nCymraeg yn foddhaol; mewn Saesneg maent yn foddhaol mewn siarad ac ysgrifennu \na da mewn darllen. Mae'r safonau yn dda ar y cyfan mewn rhifedd a TGCh yn y ddau \ngyfnod allweddol. \n��� Roedd ansawdd yr addysgu yn foddhaol neu well ym mhob gwers a arolygwyd, yn \ncynnwys 53% ble oedd yn dda ac wyth y cant yn dda iawn. Mae'r athrawon yn paratoi \neu gwersi'n drwyadl ac yn eu cyflwyno'n glir a graenus. Defnyddir ystod da o \nadnoddau i gefnogi'r dysgu a rhoddir tasgau wedi'u gwahaniaethu yn gyson i'r \ndisgyblion yn y gwersi. O dro i dro, fodd bynnag, nid yw'r cwestiynu'n ddigon \ntreiddgar a thueddir i fodloni ar ymatebion llafar byr gan y disgyblion. Mewn un neu \nddau o ddosbarthiadau, nid yw'r gwaith a roddir i'r disgyblion mwyaf galluog yn \nddigon heriol mewn rhai pynciau.  \n��� Mae datblygiad ysbrydol, cymdeithasol a diwylliannol y disgyblion yn dda a'u \ndatblygiad moesol yn dda iawn. Darperir gweithred ddyddiol o gyd-addoli ac mae \npolisi addysg bersonol a chymdeithasol (ABCh) a pholisi cyfle cyfartal yr ysgol yn \nhyrwyddo'r egwyddorion a'r gwerthoedd gorau. Mewn adran ar 'Wrth-hiliaeth' yn un \no'r polisiau hyn, dywedir bod yr ysgol yn hyrwyddo dealltwriaeth o ddiwylliannau \neraill drwy ethos yr ysgol ac yn rhai o'r them��u a astudir gan y disgyblion yn eu \ngwersi. Ymateba'r disgyblion yn dda i'r disgwyliadau sydd arnynt i barchu a \nchydymddwyn �� phobl eraill beth bynnag eu cefndir a'u hil. \n��� Mae'r ysgol yn ymwybodol o'i chyfrifoldeb i hybu dwyieithrwydd y disgyblion ac \nmae'n cyflawni hynny'n briodol. \n2\n      \n \n��� Mae safon ymddygiad y disgyblion yn dda iawn a'u hymagwedd at waith yn dda ar y \ncyfan. Roedd presenoldeb y disgyblion am y tri thymor llawn diwethaf o leia'n \nfoddhaol. \n��� Ac eithrio un elfen bwysig, mae asesu'r ysgol o ansawdd da. Mae'r polisi asesu a'r \ngyfundrefn asesu sydd wedi cael ei sefydlu'n ddiweddar yn gynhwysfawr ac o safon \ndda. Er hynny, mae peth anghysondeb yn safon y marcio ar draws yr ysgol ac ni \nwneir defnydd llawn o'r wybodaeth eang a gesglir am y disgyblion i hyrwyddo \nsafonau uwch. Mae ansawdd y cofnodi yn dda ac mae'r adroddiadau blynyddol i rieni \nyn rhoi darlun clir a chyflawn o berfformiad eu plant. \n��� Mae'r cwricwlwm yn eang a chytbwys a neilltuir digon o amser i bob pwnc. Mae \ncynllunio'r athrawon o ansawdd da yn gyffredinol ac mae'r polisiau pwnc a'r \ncynlluniau gwaith bron oll yn dda a nifer yn dda iawn.  \n��� Mae'r disgyblion yn elwa ar ystod eang o weithgareddau allgyrsiol a gemau t��m. \n��� Mae ansawdd y ddarpariaeth ar gyfer disgyblion ag AAA yn dda a gwn��nt gynnydd \nboddhaol yn y sgiliau sylfaenol. Mae'r cynlluniau addysg unigol (CAU) yn gryno ac \nyn glir a ch��nt eu hadolygu'n rheolaidd. \n��� Mae ansawdd y bartneriaeth gyda���r rhieni a���r gymuned yn dda iawn ac yn un o \ngryfderau���r ysgol. \n��� Mae ansawdd hunan-arfarnu a chynllunio ar gyfer gwelliant yn dda. Ers ei benodi, \nmae'r pennaeth wedi cyflwyno nifer o strategaethau i wella safon y ddarpariaeth \naddysgol ac ansawdd y monitro drwy'r ysgol ac mae un neu ddau o'r rhain yn dechrau \ncael effaith. Yn dilyn arolwg cyffredinol o'r ddarpariaeth oedd ar gael yn yr ysgol ar y \npryd, lluniwyd rhestr briodol o dargedau ar gyfer y tymor byr, canolig a hir ac ar ��l eu \nblaenoriaethu'n ofalus eu cynnwys yn y CDY cyfredol. Mae'r ysgol wedi dechrau \nmonitro ei pherfformiad ar nifer o wahanol lefelau gan gynnwys tracio perfformiad \ndisgybl ar ei yrfa drwy'r ysgol a rhoi targed perfformiad ar gyfer cynnydd unigolyn \ndrwy'r flwyddyn ac ar gyfer gwella cyrhaeddiad yn disgyblion ym mhrofion y CC.  \n��� Mae arweinyddiaeth a rheolaeth yr ysgol yn dda. Mae'r pennaeth yn egniol ac \nymroddgar ac yn arwain drwy esiampl. Mae'n glir ei feddwl ar sut y dylai'r ysgol \nsymud ymlaen a g��yr am bwysigrwydd dyfalbarhad a thynnu'r gorau o'r t��m o \nathrawon cydwybodol sy'n cydweithio ag ef. Mae hefyd wedi ymrwymo i wella \nansawdd a safonau.  \n��� Mae gan yr ysgol ystod dda o adnoddau dysgu ac mae'r adeiladau mewn cyflwr da ar \nwah��n i'r neuadd ginio sydd beth pellter oddiwrth yr ysgol. Mae cyflwr y neuadd yn \nis na'r safon ddisgwyliedig ac yn anghydnaws ag ethos yr ysgol. \n��� Mae'r ysgol wedi gweithredu'n llwyddiannus ar nifer o'r materion allweddol a \nddynodwyd yn adroddiad 1996. Mae gan yr ysgol yn awr gynllun datblygu manwl am \ndair blynedd ac mae wedi'i gostio'n ofalus. Trefnwyd i'r athrawon fynychu \nhyfforddiant mewn-swydd (HMS) yn y pynciau a argymhellwyd ac ymatebwyd yn \nllawn i'r cais am ddarparu mesurau diogelwch digonol i'r safle a'r adeilad. Rhoddwyd \nsylw hefyd i ddatblygu r��l y cydlynydd pwnc a chafwyd gwelliant o ganlyniad; er \nhynny, erys hwn yn faes lle mae angen datblygu ymhellach. \n3\n      \n \n3. Y SAFONAU ADDYSGOL A GYFLAWNIR GAN DDISGYBLION\n3.1 Y Safonau a gyflawnir yn y Pynciau a���r Meysydd Dysgu \nBarnwyd bod y safonau cyflawniad yn dda mewn 39% o'r gwaith, yn foddhaol mewn 55% ac \nyn anfoddhaol mewn chwech y cant.  \n��� Mae'r plant dan bump oed yn gwneud cynnydd boddhaol yn eu sgiliau iaith, \nllythrennedd a chyfathrebu, eu datblygiad mathemategol a'u datblygiad corfforol. \nMaent yn cyflawni safonau da yn eu datblygiad personol a chymdeithasol, eu \ngwybodaeth a dealltwriaeth o'r byd a'u datblygiad creadigol. \n��� Yn CA1, yn y pynciau craidd, mae safonau cyflawniad yn dda mewn gwrando a \ndarllen yn Gymraeg ac yn foddhaol mewn siarad ac ysgrifennu. Mae safonau yn dda \nmewn mathemateg ac yn foddhaol mewn gwyddoniaeth. Yn CA2, mae'r disgyblion \nyn cyflawni safonau da mewn gwrando a boddhaol mewn siarad, darllen ac \nysgrifennu Cymraeg. Mae safonau mewn siarad a darllen yn Saesneg yn dda ar y \ncyfan ac maent yn foddhaol mewn ysgrifennu. Mae safonau mewn mathemateg yn \ndda ac maent yn foddhaol mewn gwyddoniaeth.  \n��� Yn CA1, yn y pynciau sylfaen, mae safonau cyflawniad y disgyblion yn dda mewn \ndylunio a thechnoleg, technoleg gwybodaeth, hanes, celf, cerddoriaeth ac addysg \ngrefyddol ac maent yn foddhaol mewn daearyddiaeth ac addysg gorfforol. Yn CA2, \nmae'r safonau yn dda mewn dylunio a thechnoleg, technoleg gwybodaeth, hanes, celf, \ncerddoriaeth, addysg gorfforol ac addysg grefyddol ac maent yn foddhaol mewn \ndaearyddiaeth.  \n��� Nid oes gwahaniaeth amlwg yng nghyflawniadau'r merched a'r bechgyn yn yr un o'r \nddau gyfnod allweddol. Mae'r disgyblion sydd ag AAA yn gwneud cynnydd boddhaol \nyn y sgiliau sylfaenol.  \n��� Yng nghanlyniadau asesiad y CC 2001 ar gyfer CA1, roedd nifer y disgyblion a \ngyrhaeddodd lefel 2 mewn siarad, darllen ac ysgrifennu Cymraeg yn uwch o dipyn \nna'r ffigurau cenedlaethol, ond ni chafodd neb lefel 3 mewn ysgrifennu. Roedd y \ncanlyniadau mewn mathemateg yn cymharu'n ffafriol iawn ��'r canrannau \ncenedlaethol.  \n��� Yn asesiad y CC 2001 ar gyfer CA2, roedd y canlyniadau mewn Saesneg a \nmathemateg gryn dipyn yn is na'r ffigurau cenedlaethol a'r rhai mewn Cymraeg a \ngwyddoniaeth yn is o lawer. Tra'n derbyn nad oedd y garfan at ei gilydd yn gryf yn \nacademaidd, ni chyflawnodd y disgyblion ddisgwyliadau'r ysgol ar eu cyfer mewn \nCymraeg a gwyddoniaeth, er roedd eu canlyniadau'n well na'r disgwyl yn y ddau \nbwnc arall. \n3.2 Y Safonau a Gyflawnir yn y Medrau Allweddol ar draws y \nCwricwlwm \nMae cyflawniad y disgyblion yn y sgiliau allweddol ar draws y cwricwlwm yn foddhaol ar y \ncyfan mewn iaith ac yn dda mewn rhifedd a TGCh. \n��� Mae'r plant dan bump yn gwneud cynnydd boddhaol mewn gwrando a siarad \nCymraeg. \n4\n      \n \n��� Yn CA1 a CA2, mae'r disgyblion yn gwrando'n dda ac weithiau'n dda iawn. Maent yn \ngwrando'n astud ar gyflwyniadau a chyfarwyddiadau'r athrawon ac, mewn \ngweithgareddau gr��p, ar gyfraniadau disgyblion eraill. Yn y ddau gyfnod allweddol, \nmae disgyblion yn gwneud cynnydd boddhaol mewn siarad Cymraeg a Saesneg ac \nmae nifer fechan ym mhob dosbarth ��'r gallu i siarad yn rhwydd ac yn raenus.  \n��� Mae'r plant dan bump oed yn gwneud cynnydd boddhaol mewn darllen ac ysgrifennu. \nYn CA1 a CA2, mae disgyblion yn cyflawni safonau da ar y cyfan mewn darllen \nCymraeg a Saesneg a boddhaol mewn ysgrifennu. Mae mwyafrif y disgyblion yn \nmwynhau darllen a gwn��nt ddefnydd o lyfrau a thaflenni gwaith yn rheolaidd mewn \nnifer o bynciau. Amrywiol yw'r sgiliau ysgrifennu ar draws yr oedrannau. Bydd rhai \no'r disgyblion hynaf yn cyflawni tasgau estynedig ond amherir ar gyfran sylweddol \no'u gwaith gan ddiffygion mewn cystrawen a sillafu. \n��� Mae'r plant dan bump oed yn gwneud cynnydd boddhaol mewn datblygu eu medredd \nrhifedd ac mae'r disgyblion yn y ddau gyfnod allweddol yn cyflawni safonau da ar y \ncyfan yn eu defnydd o rifedd ar draws y cwricwlwm. Mae'r mwyafrif yn gwneud \ncynnydd addas mewn tasgau rhifyddeg-pen a medrant ymdrin yn briodol �� thasgau \nsy'n ymwneud �� rhifo, mesur a phwyso mewn pynciau fel gwyddoniaeth a dylunio a \nthechnoleg. \n��� Mae sgiliau TGCh y plant dan bump oed yn datblygu'n dda ac mae'r disgyblion yn y \nddau gyfnod allweddol yn cyflawni safonau da ar y cyfan yn eu defnydd o TGCh gan \ngymhwyso eu medrau i waith mewn iaith a mathemateg a nifer helaeth o'r pynciau \nsylfaen.  \n4. ETHOS YR YSGOL \n4.1 Datblygiad Ysbrydol, Moesol, Cymdeithasol a Diwylliannol y \nDisgyblion \nMae datblygiad ysbrydol, cymdeithasol a diwylliannol y disgyblion yn dda a'u datblygiad \nmoesol yn dda iawn. \n��� Mae'r ysgol yn cwrdd ��'r gofynion statudol o ran darparu gweithred ddyddiol o \ngydaddoli ac mae'r gwasanaethau ysgol-gyfan a'r un a gynhelir yn wythnosol yn y \ndosbarth yn ysgogi twf ysbrydol y disgyblion yn llwyddiannus.

From the responses I have been informed of, it looks as though \nthis has a broad spectrum of support among MPs. One activist even managed \nto speak to Alan Johnson, the Minister with responsibility for the Equality \nBill. A number of other Ministers have said they will encourage colleagues \nto support such amendments, and we have identified a number of MPs who \nwould be willing to table the amendments or speak on our behalf in the debates.\n\nWithin the trade union movement there is considerable support - at Friday's \nTUC LGBT Committee it was agreed that the TUC should work with Press For \nChange to get an appropriate amendment tabled, preferably by the \nGovernment. My own union, Amicus, are taking responsibility for the legal \naspect of the campaign, ensuring that the proposed amendment will have the \ndesired effect. The reason for the TUC taking responsibility for leading \nthe trade union side of the campaign, rather than one of its constituent \nunions, is to provide a coordinated effort and show that it is the whole \nlabour movement involved.\n\nOne note of caution was made at the meeting on Friday - the amendment on \ngrounds of sexual orientation gives the Government power to introduce the \nprotections by Regulation. This could lead to all sorts of exemptions, \nweakening the effect of the protection (see some of the problems with the \nEmployment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations and our own Sex \nDiscrimination (Gender Reassignment) Regulations). These will obviously \nneed to be resisted or challenged in the High Court.\n\nI will keep you informed of any progress as I hear of it.\n\nRegards,\n\nTamsin\n\nStephen Whittle, PhD, MA, LLB, BA\nHead of the Graduate School, HLSS\nReader in Law\nManchester Metropolitan University\nAll Saints West\nLower Ormond Street\nManchester, M15 6HB\ntel: 0161 247 6444, fax: 0161 247 6309\nemail: s.t.whittle@mmu.ac.uk\n\n \"Before acting on this email or opening any attachments you\nshould read the Manchester Metropolitan University's email\ndisclaimer available on its website\nhttp://www.mmu.ac.uk/emaildisclaimer \"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tPrev by date: UK: Stamping Out Homophobia - Conference Feb 6th 2006 [TUC]\n\tNext by date: Seminar on Children's sexualties including trans issues\n\tPrev by thread: UK: Stamping Out Homophobia - Conference Feb 6th 2006 [TUC]\n\tNext by thread: Seminar on Children's sexualties including trans issues\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tÂ \tÂ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright Â© PressÂ forÂ Change, 1997-2007.

The upset this has caused to schools, pupils and parents is quite unacceptable.  The breakdown of trust between the Council, its schools and its residents through this leak will have to be repaired as soon as possible if we are to move forward with what is best for our children and their education.  I have met today with Jeremy Patterson, Chief Executive to demand that an inquiry is held as soon as possible into this whole debacle.\"\n\n\n\nCllr Davies added, \"I want to reassure every parent that no decisions have been made.

          "perfection\nonline: 22 august 2004  \nmodified: 26, 28 august 2004\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22 august 2004   an achieved perfection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19:29 I am sitting to eat a sandwich and a pear on a low wall by an ornamental canal...And to drink water. There is a renaissance style mansion (of about 1810?) nearby and two spherical stone bollards between which is a step from which to enter an imaginary ornamental barge on which to travel a short length of canal while visiting the landscape garden... or at least that is what this landing place was designed for - a life of achieved perfections in a world in which religious superstition, but not aristocracy, had been overcome. Question mark?\n\n\nAs I compose these thoughts I can see  groups of 2 to 6 people sitting on the grass between isolated trees and a group of 7 crows walking together.  In the distance are three white geese with yellow beaks such as you might expect in an old-fashioned story book for children. I feel their presence, like that of the mansion and the imaginary barge on the water, and the real ornamental fish in it, are parts of an achieved if contrived utopia such as idealists plan and the rest of us may occasionally enjoy - though perhaps more as fiction than reality. Second question mark?\n\n\n\n\nNow the sun has ceased to shine on this scene and people look as if they will soon depart while the animals will stay all night in this piece of architectural dreamland (which to them is perhaps everything). The geese are still in amongst the people who are feeding them as if they had been invited to their picnic. \n\n\n\n\nAnd now, before departing myself, I consider the possibility of writing my  most useful thoughts and experiences in a form accessible to anyone who has not shared the life in which they arose, and still arise... \n\n\n\n...and as I do so a small woman and a vast dog, surely the same weight and length as herself, walk by in evident accord (or should I say friendship?) despite the collar and lead that connect them.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan it be that the world, even the part we contrive, is better than we think?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(these pages are designed to be read with the window set to two-thirds of the screen width)\n\n\n\nwhat's new\n\n\nhomepage\n\n\n\n\ndigital diary archive\n\n\n\n\n\ndaffodil email newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2002, 2003, 2004 john chris jones\n\n\n\nYou may transmit this text to anyone for any non-commercial purpose if you include the copyright line and this notice and if you respect the copyright of quotations.\n\n\nIf you wish to reproduce any of this text commercially please send a copyright permission request to jcj at softopia.demon.co.uk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Firstly some lunatic spent their evening posting some rubbish about the Canadian forces in every board on the forum - now you've got to be bored to bother doing that.  Or be estranged lunatic ARRSE user with a grudge of course.\n\n\n\nAnd this morning there seem to be loads of site errors.  PMs that don't go, images that don't appear, recent posts links that aren't and so on.  I've also had a major understanding issue today - I can't work out what people are trying to say to me.  I would blame others, but as it seems to be everyone, I think I must be solid.  I didn't even drink much last night.  I did manage to complete my extraction from the chick from 2 weeks ago though - no, not the plastic enhanced one.\n\n\n\nI'm also a bit concerned about my kit.  Now I don't live in the most law abiding neck of the woods and there are a lot of theiving gypsy b astards around here.  If it's not nailed down it goes - so far that's been two car radio aerials, one wing mirror, a little gucci motocycle lock bag thing and a laptop.  Yup, seriously.  \n\n\n\nI've got the world's oldest, crapiest windows and security is based on the fact that they're on the 3rd floor of a big old building, however someone has decided to paint the building and I now have scaffolding - that is a complete theiving gypsy b astard climbing frame, just outside my window.  If work on ARRSE stops over the next couple of weeks it's becuase a gypo has had my PC away.\n\n\n\nCopied from blogs (original entry) - post comments here.\n\n\n\nRe: Overnight Gremlin Assault.\n\n\nPosted: Wed Jun 08, 2005 1:43 pm\n\nAuthor: Murielson Location: Hampshire - Andover in fact (when not in Watford)\n\n\nAnswer? Electricity to scaffolding or window frame. Turns your average no good, thieving gypsy into worlds greatest breakdancer for short period before they explode.\n\n\n\nRe: Overnight Gremlin Assault.\n\n\nPosted: Wed Jun 08, 2005 2:30 pm\n\nAuthor: blessed baby cakes Location: With my tongue stuck to the freezer door of the padlocked ice-cream cabinets........\n\n\nI like Muriels idea, we live in the civilised world and had a problem with scaffolding a few years ago, we ended up, and i sh*t you not, nailing a piece of wood to the window frames to stop them opening to far, and in the gap we had when open placing wood with razors in it! it worked well, infact the blood was a testimony to how well!  \n\n\n\nRe: Overnight Gremlin Assault.\n\n\nPosted: Wed Jun 08, 2005 2:50 pm\n\nAuthor: Good CO \n\n\nAhhh, but we live in a world where doing anything more than posting a polite sign asking said thief to leave your stuff alone results in a prison sentence.\n\n\n\nRe: Overnight Gremlin Assault.\n\n\nPosted: Wed Jun 08, 2005 6:06 pm\n\nAuthor: blessed baby cakes Location: With my tongue stuck to the freezer door of the padlocked ice-cream cabinets........\n\n\nScrews in window due to small child visiting third floor apartment in summer months, razors due to cats creeping in off scaffolding during the night and peeing on floor....... nothing sinister there! \n\n\n\nAll times are GMT\nPage 1 of 1 \nhttp://www.arrse.co.uk/\n\n",

Nearly twenty volunteers turned out to help.\n\nThe Peace of Mind Garden was created by Breathing Space, the confidential phoneline for people experiencing depression or other mental health problems.\n\nUnfortunately, the garden had fallen into disrepair.  Sections of it had become completely overgrown, and serious littering was also a problem. The team cleared litter and weeds from the whole garden.  The front section was then swept, and has new plants added.  The rear section, which had become completely overgrown, was strimmed and turned over.  Breathing Space plan to use this section as an area for local schoolchildren to plant flowers, and showcase their own art. It was hard work, but the team also enjoyed the day and felt a real sense of accomplishment at the end.\n\nI believe that Social Action projects are a great way to demonstrate how in touch Conservatives are with their local communities.\n\n\n\nI think this project was important on two levels.  Firstly, Kings Park is an important amenity.  It?s an oasis of green space in the centre of Stirling itself, and is used extensively by local residents including families with young children.  Conservative councillors in Stirling were recently instrumental in improving the play facilities there, and we believe the whole park should look as good as it can. Secondly, depression and similar conditions affect a large number of people.\n\nI was delighted that we were able to help out Breathing Space, which is an organisation dedicated to giving people affected by these problems a chance to talk confidentially to experts who truly understand what they are going through. I am very proud of Stirling?s contribution.  I hope that local people will now be able to enjoy this beautiful garden for years to come.  We?d like to thank the Friends of Kings Park and Stirling Council for allowing us to undertake the project, and the Council for help with the initial strimming and clearing away the rubbish at the end. It was a real team effort, demonstrating the principle of shared responsibility between political parties, volunteers and the state.  We really are all in it together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n( 1 comments )\n\nTags: Breathing Space, Stirling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment on this blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\tGo to The Blue Blog\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tSubscribe\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\tPrint\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n?

If the Government can find billions to bail out the bankers who? then proceed to waste it on their pensions and their bonuses, why can?t the Government find cash to make it worthwhile for people to go out and do this sort of housekeeping work on local green spaces, without having to rely on volunteers all the time. Work is work and it is not unreasonable to expect to be paid for doing it?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSorry, forgot to add great post!

It will look to encompass the key transition point of those aged 17-19 years within the criminal justice system.\n\nIt will also seek to engage with National Offender Management Service Cymru and the Welsh Assembly Government’s Department of Children, Education, Lifelong Learning and Skills policy areas responsible for education of offenders older than 18.\n\nFunding\n\nThe amount is approximately £1.25 million. It will be split between:\n\n\tyoung people within the community (approximately 70%)\n\tthose within the secure estate (30%).\n\n\nThis equates to the significant variance of individuals attached to a YOT and the numbers within a custodial setting. The Initiative targets:\n\n\tyoung women\n\tyoung people with Special Educational Needs\n\tyoung Welsh people from the Black and Minority Ethnic community\n\toutreach and ‘in reach’ support to the secure estate in Wales and England up to the age of 20 years (eligible up to one day before this birthday).\n\n\nEuropean Social Fund: First Footholds\n\nThe Initiative is a European Social Fund (ESF) Convergence project. It comes under the ‘First Footholds’ heading of Reach the Heights. ‘First Footholds’ aims to engage with Wales’s most disadvantaged young people to help them tackle the barriers that get in the way of them learning and moving on. This includes support for young people and training for those helping them, along with new opportunities for learning in work and other environments.\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLearning for children and young people in a youth custody setting in Wales-Statutory guidance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main purpose of those provisions of the Act is to mirror as far as is reasonably practicable the learning arrangements for children and young people in custody.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\nHome|\n\n\t\nAbout|\n\n\t\nNews|\n\n\t\nTopics|\n\n\t\nPublications|\n\n\t\nConsultation|\n\n\t\nLegislation|\n\n\t\nFunding|\n\n\t\nCampaigns|\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n©\nCopyright Statement\n\n|\n\n\t\n\nTerms and Conditions\n\n|\n\n\t\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n|\n\n\t\n\nNational Assembly for Wales\n\n|\n\n\t\n\nScottish Government\n\n|\n\n\t\n\nNorthern Ireland Executive\n\n|\n\n\t\n\nDirectGov\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\t\n",

It is important to remember him because he is a true Norfolk heroes especially because of his work with agricultural workers.\n\n“He was a man who started life in the harshest conditions rose up and was eventually knighted. It is an incredible story.”\n\nThe memorial event and talk was organised by the Norfolk branch of the rural section of Unite and the East Anglia district of the Methodist Church.\n\nTo read more of this story on EDP24 click here\n\n\t\n., 29/06/2009\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t    Article printed from www.networknorwich.co.uk at 23:55 on 03 June 2010\n\t\t\n\n",

A phone rang in a far corner of the office that we had entirely forgotten about.\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Steve.\n\n\"I haven't a clue,\" I replied, and a brief search of the area turned up the answer.\n\nThe fax machine.\n\n\"A fax machine? Since when have we had a fax machine?\"\n\nAnd: \"How quaint!\"\n\nAnd: \"Look! There's some paper coming out! Haven't these people heard of email?\"\n\nIt was a triumph of ancient technology over the spanking new digital age, and we were so impressed we threw the fax into the recycling bin.\n\nThe world, it seems, is filled with old technology that simply refuses to die peacefully. The latest Argos catalogue, that dictionary of household taste, still has a page of Sony Walkmans (they never came up with a decent plural in all those years) that take cassettes. Even CD Walkmen are a tad passé, and I should know, I've got three.\n\nSo, I've wasted literally minutes of my life coming up with a list of \"How Quaint\" technology that won't go away:\n\n* Faxes\n* Audio cassettes\n\n* VHS video\n* Dial-up internet\n\n* Four star petrol\n* \"I'm calling from a pay phone\"\n\n* \"I've got to renew my CB radio licence\"\n* \"And over on Radio 4 Long Wave, Test Match Special\"\n\nAnd yes, we still have a PC in our operation that runs Windows 3.11 on a 66MHz processor.

Action without vision is a nightmare.\"\n\nA political mantra has grown in the twenty-first century, which means that it is now obligatory for all leading politicians to demonstrate their understanding of climate change.  Pressure has been growing to implement planning policies which will enable the reduction of carbon in the atmosphere and the development of a Zero Carbon Britain.\n\nThere is no problem with the vision - all politicians are signed up to tackle climate change but we need action at a local level to make this vision a reality.  Planners will soon become the heroes of the future as they put this vision into action.  As one of my own heroes David Lloyd George said \"the finest eloquence is that which gets things done\".\n\nAs a member of the Welsh Assembly I am particularly interested in making Wales an exemplar of best practice in achieving Zero Carbon status, but I am aware of the different levels of Governance which control planning.\n\nAt this moment Directives from Europe are driving the agenda, but here in the UK a trilogy of Parliamentary Bills will have an enormous impact on the development of a Zero Carbon Britain.  These Bills are the Climate Change Bill, the Energy Bill and the Planning Bill.  By laying down the stepping stones they demonstrate that clear political leadership is necessary to lead the way to a zero carbon future.\n\nThe vital role that local authorities play in the planning process is being increasingly recognised but so far energy saving has mostly focussed on the social housing stock.   In Wales nearly 80% of our housing stock is privately owned.  Current powers do not allow the Welsh Assembly Government to change the overall structure of Local Development Plans, but this is something that may be addressed under the Planning Bill.\n\nOur Minister for the Environment intends to use the Planning Bill to secure legislative competence for the National Assembly over Local Development Plans - this will give the Welsh Assembly more power to work with local authorities to think globally and act locally, as local authorities have a key role to play in focussing community action through their strategic partnerships and leadership.\n\nOne of the key areas of operation for planning policies is the residential sector.  Housing demonstrates how quickly technological developments can reach zero carbon.  The eco build exhibition which recently took place in Earl's Court in London demonstrated the first affordable zero carbon home, which was built by the Zed factory and awarded Code 6 status of the Code for Sustainable Homes.\n\nThe Government in England is aiming to adopt this code for all new build by 2016.  In Wales the target is somewhat more ambitious at 2011 and while the Code for Sustainable Homes will soon be introduced, this code is voluntary only.  We need the power over building regulations to be devolved, so that all new developments in Wales can be built to the highest environmental standards possible.\n\nHowever local authorities and planners must not sit back and wait for the upper levels of the political hierarchy to gain these powers.  Uncertainty must not be an excuse for inaction.  Local authorities will inevitably have some responsibility for helping to reduce carbon emissions in private housing under future legislation and the sooner carbon reduction practices are adopted the better.\n\nIn the meantime we must also tackle the challenge of our existing housing stock.  Over two-thirds of properties that exist in 2050 are already standing.  In Wales 'hard to heat' homes need the most attention as 37% of all homes are not on the gas network and 32% or properties have solid walls which are difficult and expensive to insulate.\n\nThe planning issue of how to make these houses cheaper and easier to heat is something that must be addressed if we are really serious about tackling climate change.  Micro-generation must become a crucial part of the UK's energy future.  It can help reduce emissions, contribute to security of energy supply and help relieve fuel poverty.  Feed-in tariffs could provide an incentive to boost the adoption of renewable energy and Smart Meters can encourage energy efficiency and behavioural change which is key to tackling climate change.\n\nDevolution offers benefits in using and comparing experiences in devolved countries, in particular where innovative planning policies are developed and implemented.  We must look to the local authorities that are already leading the way.\n\nThe Merton Rule is perhaps the best known piece of innovative planning that provides a step forward to a Zero Carbon Britain.  The Merton Rule is an energy efficiency practice which states that 10% of the energy requirements of new developments must be met through on site renewable energy.\n\nIn Powys the CO2i domestic energy efficiency and renewable energy project ran for 18 months and saw the installation of numerous measures, including for example nearly 2,000 cavity wall insulations, over 2,500 loft insulations, 140 solar hot water panels, 300 hot water tank jackets and over 20,500 low energy light bulbs - great results!\n\nThe Whole Home Display in the Wates House at the Centre for Alternative Technology in Machynlleth is another excellent example of a low impact living house for the future and a great illustration of how to reduce the carbon footprint of your home.\n\nBut zero carbon planning is not just about the housing sector.  It is planning based on the reduction of carbon, which means the embedding of carbon reduction across a wide range of policy.   This includes buildings, waste, energy saving and production, transport and the delivery of all public services.\n\nIn the transport sector, mitigating climate change can only be achieved by reducing the need for travel.  In 2005 travel comprised 43% of per capita carbon emissions so clearly this sector has a crucial role to play in the drive towards a low carbon future.\n\nOn a local level in Wales we must secure better routes for cyclists and pedestrians and plan better public transport strategies so that we can substitute road transport with rail and bus travel.  On a UK and EU level we must plan to increase the fuel efficiency of private transport and increase the proportion of our fuels that come from renewable sources.\n\nThe 'Zero Carbon Britain' report from the Centre for Alternative Technology contains details of how a zero carbon Britain can be achieved and concludes that a zero carbon Britain is both \"scientifically necessary\" and \"technically possible\".  However this can only be achieved by embedding carbon appraisal and carbon reduction into every planning policy.\n\nThere is currently a lack of coherence between government policies and local planning authorities.  The integration of all departments, both in government and local government, is essential for planning process to work to the benefit of society, the environment and the economy.  Climate change will not halt in its tracks so we must not be pulled down by those who still need to wake up to the green agenda.  We have to plan for a sustainable future, but the only future possible is a sustainable one and we need to prepare for it now.\n\n\n\nBookmark this story at:\ndel.icio.us\nDigg\nFacebook\nLibDig\nreddit\nStumbleUpon\n\n\nPrint this press article.\n\n\nComment on this press article.\n\n\nPrevious press article: Politically Speaking - Agriculture (Mon 5th Nov 2007).\n\n\nNext press article: Renewable Energy in Wales  (Fri 20th Jun 2008).\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinted and hosted by Prater Raines Ltd, 98 Sandgate High Street, Folkestone CT20 3BY.\n\n\nPublished and promoted by Montgomeryshire Liberal Democrats, at 3 Park Street, Newtown, SY16 1EE.\n\n\nThe views expressed are those of the party, not of the service provider.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We now come to the debate on the state of the care system. Mr. Speaker has selected the amendment in the name of the Prime Minister.\n\nMr. Paul Burstow (Sutton and Cheam): I beg to move,\n\nThat this House believes that the underfunding of social care by successive Governments has led to bottlenecks and delays in the NHS, reducing health care capacity and increasing waiting times; further believes that it is the most vulnerable elderly who suffer the consequences of inadequate care; regrets that the piecemeal approach of the Government to hospital delayed discharge simply shifts the pressures from one part of the care system to another; condemns the Government for its mishandling and misunderstanding of the care home sector and the consequent loss of homes and beds; regrets that the failure to adequately fund social care has produced serious staff shortages and reduced choice and quality for those in need of care; and calls on the Government to undertake a whole system review of funding for social care to tackle staff shortages, increase capacity, promote choice and ensure that people get the right care at the right time.\n\nI am pleased that my hon. Friends and others are staying for this important debate on the state of the care system and the crisis in it. The national health service is always in the news, but the Government often overclaim for it and for their delivery. In fact, it frequently underperforms. As with the railways, they have been too timid and from day one they failed to invest in our health care and our health systems.\n\nThe results of that are there for all too see: long waits in our accident and emergency departments, more people waiting for treatment, more people waiting to get out of hospital after being treated. The NHS is short-staffed and struggling to deliver, but it is only part of the picture. Step back and take a look at the bigger picture--the care system outside our hospitals. The Cinderella status given to social care and the failure to invest in the care system are fuelling the pressures on accident and emergency departments and hospital wards.\n\nThere are countless victims of this Government's failure to invest in the care system--every year, 700,000 elderly people find themselves stuck in hospital and unable to leave because there is not enough care provision outside. Grotesquely, elderly people are left in hospital waiting for someone to die in a care home before the council will fund their care home place. In parts of the country, two people have to die before one new care place is funded. People are labelled bed blockers as if it is their fault that they are stuck in hospital. It is the Government's fault, but those 700,000 are just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nRichard Younger-Ross (Teignbridge): My hon. Friend refers to \"bed blockers\" and suggests that the Government blame elderly people for being in those beds. Should not we use the expression \"bed lockers\", because it is the lack of Government funding that ties elderly people to beds?\n\nMr. Burstow: My hon. Friend makes a fair point. As a consequence of the Government's failure to invest in social care and the care system outside our hospitals, there is increasing gridlock in the care system. As a consequence of that, people are suffering and receiving bad care.\n\nWhat is happening to people waiting for treatment? We know that in the five years since the Government came to power at least 5,000 years of bed time have been lost to the NHS as a result of delayed discharges. Who pays the price for that incompetence--5,000 years of time wasted? In the first quarter of this year alone, 22,000 more people could have been treated if the care system did not leave people stuck in bed once they are well. If we managed to treat those people in the health service and get them out quicker, we would be able to reduce or perhaps remove the need for them to fly abroad or rely on private health care for treatment.\n\nMadam Speaker, looking at the figures for the first quarter--\n\nMr. Tony McNulty (Harrow, East): Madam Deputy Speaker.\n\nMr. Burstow: Maybe in the future. Let us guess how many operations have been cancelled in the first quarter of this year. For want of an NHS bed and appropriate treatment, 20,000 people had their operations cancelled.\n\nMr. Andrew Turner (Isle of Wight): I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's argument. Although the Government are open to criticism for the way in which they fund social services authorities, does he not agree that some authorities hardly assist in ending bed blocking? For example, the Rev. David Barker of Nettlestone in my constituency is concerned that the Isle of Wight council, which is of course led by the Liberal Democrats, is not providing the necessary support for people who are sent home, so they are left in beds.\n\nMr. Burstow: It is a great pity that the hon. Gentleman is not backing his council to make sure that it has the resources to do the job. It will be noted in the Isle of Wight that he is not standing up for the Isle of Wight to ensure that it has the resources; many of his hon. Friends do defend their social services departments.\n\nMr. Andrew Turner: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?\n\nMr. Burstow: No, the hon. Gentleman has made his point. [Interruption.]\n\nMadam Deputy Speaker: Order. I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman has made it clear that he is not giving way for a second time.\n\nMr. Burstow: I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman may not have liked the answer, but that is the answer he is going to get.\n\nThere is a chronic shortage of staff and a substantial loss of care home beds, and care increasingly is being rationed. These are the hallmarks of a Government who have neglected the care system. Last year the King's Fund report \"Future Imperfect\" warned the Government of the increasing difficulty in recruiting and retaining staff, with vacancy rates in excess of 20 per cent. and turnover rates in excess of 16 per cent. It is no wonder that some home care agencies have hit crisis point and have gone out of business.\n\nDr. Jenny Tonge (Richmond Park): Before my hon. Friend leaves the causes of bed blocking and the subject of social services departments, does he agree that there has been a gross neglect of district nursing services by all health authorities in recent years? District nurses are getting older and unable to cope. People are not going into the profession, because of the pay and conditions. However, they are crucial to relieving bed blocking from hospitals.\n\nMr. Burstow: District nurses are an essential part of the team that is needed in the community to facilitate appropriate and prompt discharge from hospital. In too many places, as my hon. Friend has rightly said, they are not there in the numbers needed to do the job.\n\nAdded to that is the issue of the new standards for domiciliary care and the fact that a high proportion of home care workers are not far off retirement. As a result, things are set to get worse before they get better in that sector. The same difficulties beset the care home sector.\n\nMr. David Heath (Somerton and Frome): My hon. Friend is being extremely generous in giving way. Before he leaves the subject of the domiciliary sector, is there not now a real problem in recruiting domiciliary assistants not only in the public sector, but in the private and voluntary sectors? Is it not the case that the standard spending assessment for personal social services across the country fails to deal adequately with that problem this year, which means that the situation can only get worse?\n\nMr. Burstow: My hon. Friend is right, and I wish to refer to the social services SSAs in due course.\n\nI was about to say that the same difficulties beset the care homes sector. The Association of Residential Care said recently:\n\n\"With some supermarkets offering £8 per hour to stock shelves overnight it is hard to attract staff to a complex and often stressful job for much less money. In some parts of the country the only people applying for vacancies are those that Mcdonald's and Tesco have already rejected.\"\n\nIt is a frightening thought that our care homes are so dependent on the rejects from McDonald's.\n\nStaff shortages are no excuse for a minority of care homes that resort to the restraint and chemical management of residents instead of offering decent care. The Local Government Association has warned the Government about staff shortages: in particular, the vacancies of about 10 per cent. in management posts which have led to a cycle of heavy workloads, low morale, long hours and high staff turnover.\n\nCare staff are voting with their feet. As many as one in five care staff, social services staff and others are actively seeking new jobs. No wonder two out of three social services departments are reporting recruitment difficulties. We are faced with the real prospect of importing staff from abroad, only to export elderly people to the continent to be cared for.\n\nIn the care homes sector, there is no escaping the fact that a combination of falling incomes and rising costs has resulted in a substantial loss of beds. In the last three years alone, 35,000 beds have been lost and the number of new registrations has dropped dramatically.\n\nMr. Nigel Waterson (Eastbourne): If the hon. Gentleman feels so strongly on this point, can he explain why, during its eight years of running East Sussex county\n\ncouncil, his own party came consistently bottom of the national league table for the rates it paid to care home owners?\n\nMr. Burstow: Probably for the same reason I gave to the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner): the council in question was not properly funded in terms of social services. Yet again the hon. Gentleman plays into the hands of the Government by dividing councils and accusing them of failing to deliver, when in fact they have not been given the resources to do the job in the first place.\n\nAs a result, care home fees have been driven down so far that we are in a situation where it is impossible to be certain that continuity of provision can be maintained. With figures as low as £225 per week for residential care and £336 for nursing care, how are owners supposed to comply with the new standards, let alone staff their homes and care for the residents?\n\nMr. Stephen McCabe (Birmingham, Hall Green): I have some sympathy with the points that the hon. Gentleman is making. But how does he reconcile the difficulty that he describes, of new care standards--which he criticises--and of staff whom he describes as McDonald's rejects? Surely if we want the right staff in place, we must have the standards to encourage them.\n\nMr. Burstow: The hon. Gentleman is quite right to say that standards must be appropriate and that there is a need for extra training. But training is not cost free; it requires money. The problem is that the Government have not recognised that and they appear to be in denial when it comes to the extra costs that are a consequence of compliance with the standards. That is where the problem lies and that is why we are bring the matter to the House tonight.\n\nOn issues of funding, we see that private payers and so-called preserved rights residents are subsidising the shortfalls in state-paid fees. In the case of preserved rights residents, this was in excess of £50 million last year alone. Charities that run care homes are using as much as £185 million of their own funds to plug the gap in state funding for care. That is 19 per cent. up on last year and it is still rising. Money given by the public for charitable purposes is used to prop up state-funded care that is inadequate because it is not properly funded.\n\nOn top of that funding shortfall and the staffing crisis in care homes, care homes are also faced with the new care standards coming in this April. Higher standards will mean fewer residents and even less income. Try selling that to a bank manager: \"We want to make adaptations and changes to our care home and we need extra capital to pay for that. But we will have less income once we have made the changes\". I do not see many bank managers signing up to that.\n\nIt is no wonder that, faced with mounting difficulties, care homes are often realising a better rate of return on their capital by selling the property. The victims of this are the frail and vulnerable elderly who are forced to pack their bags and move to another home. The trauma can and does kill. Despite mounting evidence of the extra costs of complying with the new standards, Ministers seem to remain in denial.\n\nEarlier today I was briefed by Leonard Cheshire Homes, which had done some calculations on the costs of complying with the standards for young adults. It found that the weekly cost per resident in one of its homes for disabled adults will rise from £680 to £1,092, a 62 per cent. increase to comply with the training and other standards laid out by the Government. In addition it has estimated that it will need to find an extra 237 nurses to deliver the standards. Where are 237 extra nurses coming from? The NHS? I do not think so. The Government need to spell out where the extra resources are coming from.\n\nHome care fares no better. Under the Government, there has been a 19 per cent. reduction in the number of people receiving home care--93,000 fewer people a year receiving home care in just four years. The Government amendment says that more people are living independently. Perhaps that is what it means--93,000 extra people not being supported in their own homes.\n\nThe rules have been rewritten so that only the most frail and dependent are looked after and the rest have to fend for themselves. To make money stretch a little further, care is increasingly being rationed. It is being rationed by denying help to those with moderate care needs or with a carer at home. It is being rationed for those who have high care needs by having them to wait in hospital beds or, more likely, having them wait unseen in their own home. It is also being rationed by setting limits either on how much the council is prepared to pay or on the quantity or quality of care to be provided.\n\nAccording to the LGA, six out of 10 councils have tightened or proposed to tighten the way in which they ration care, as a way of controlling their spending. All we are talking about tonight are things that are not luxuries--help with getting in and out of bed, getting dressed, keeping clean, eating a reasonably balanced diet, having nails cut, using the toilet, having clean laundry, living in a decent environment. We are talking about a person's basic dignity. That is why Liberal Democrats remain committed to the principle that personal care should be free, on the basis of a person's need.\n\nIncreasingly, personal care involves services that would have been seen in the past as nursing care, such as changing catheters and dressings, preventing or treating pressure sores and managing medication. That is why Liberal Democrats say that nursing care should be free on the basis of need, not according to who provides it.\n\nThe Government's answer to the crisis in the care system is to treat the symptoms and not the causes. The £200 million initiative to tackle bed blocking that was announced last year falls well short of what is needed to tackle the staff shortages, capacity constraints and rationing of the care system that are causing delayed discharges. The £200 million has to be set against a long history of underfunding.\n\nYear by year, the gap between what councils spend and what the Government think needs to be spent on social care has widened. The gap has increased from 3 per cent. in the early 1990s to 8 per cent. in the mid-1990s; in the past three years, it has widened to a gulf of 12 per cent. More than £1 billion has to be found by local councils through council tax to meet statutory duties and respond to yet more Government initiatives and priorities. As a direct consequence, over the past two years three out of four social services departments have overspent their budgets.\n\nHow much worse would the problems in the NHS be if councils spent down to the level the Government think is necessary and clamped down on overspending?\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the absence of any extra cash for social care in this year's local government settlement is mind boggling. Social care has been shortchanged to the tune of £113 million in the coming year--money that was pencilled in by Ministers in the spending assessment in 2000, but not actually delivered this year. As a consequence, overspending will continue to rise.\n\nHealth and social care are two sides of the same coin: underfund one and the other is undermined. It is for that reason that the Government must undertake a whole system review of funding social care. Such a review must go beyond the Government's sticking plaster solution of cash to tackle delayed discharges. What is needed is long-term, sustained investment in social care, informed by a realistic assessment of what is needed to deliver real improvements.\n\nSocial care is stuck in crisis management mode. Those with less acute needs drop off the queue, only for the vicious circle of lack of support, leading to increased dependency and greater calls on high intensity care, to start all over again. That is a false economy that is doing great harm. The true cost of running the system in that way is measured in two ways--in ministerial failure and in human misery.\n\nSeveral hon. Members rose--\n\nMadam Deputy Speaker: I call Mr. Hinchliffe. [Interruption.]\n\nMadam Deputy Speaker: I apologise. I thought that the Minister was holding back.\n\nThe Minister of State, Department of Health (Jacqui Smith): I beg to move, To leave out from \"House\" to the end of the Question, and to add instead thereof:\n\n\"welcomes the Government's strategy for modernising social care services through unprecedented real terms increases in resources, which enables and promotes better joint working between the NHS, social services, and the independent care sectors, develops a national framework for standards and quality and ensures a greater emphasis on users and patients in the design and delivery of services; notes that this has led to more independence for older people, fairer funding of long term care, reduced levels of delayed discharge and greater choice for users; and condemns the Liberal Democrats for their obsession with producer interests over those of users and patients and their failure to recognise that investment must be matched by reform.\"\n\nI am sorry, Madam Deputy Speaker, but the peroration of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) was so underwhelming that I had not realised that he had finished speaking.\n\nThe care system plays a vital role in ensuring that vulnerable people of all ages receive the care that they need, and I should like to start by commending the efforts of those social workers and care staff in both the public and independent sectors who, every day of the week, provide support and opportunity to people in need. Incidentally, those staff will not have been impressed by their description by the hon. Gentleman as rejects from McDonald's. That reference might have been noted outside the House.\n\nMr. Burstow rose--\n\nJacqui Smith: I hope that the hon. Gentleman intends to withdraw that slur on our care staff.\n\nMr. Burstow: It was an attributed quotation from an organisation. That is all.\n\nJacqui Smith: The hon. Gentleman has not apologised, but he has attempted to pass the buck. However, it is clear that we can all do more to ensure that the care system provides the right care at the right time and in the right place, that it promotes independence and choice and that it puts the user and the carer at the centre of services.\n\nThe hon. Gentleman made much of delayed discharges and we are all agreed that we need to make sure that people do not have to wait in acute hospital beds when they could be better cared for elsewhere. That is, of course, not a new problem and, in fact, the proportion of older people who have to wait while their discharge is arranged has fallen steadily over the past four years. It is true, however, that we need to consider the issue seriously.\n\nA serious consideration of this issue must start with an honest look at the figures. Today we have heard ludicrous claims about the number of people who have their discharge delayed. This evening, the figure went up to 700,000. Throughout the day, the figure has varied by about 200,000, depending on which edition of the press release is being referred to. The hon. Gentleman's calculator may have been red-hot today, but I am afraid that taking a figure from a parliamentary answer and then multiplying it by the number he first thought of might make for good stories, but it does not get us any further in the important task of ensuring that everybody gets the care they need when they need it and where they need it.\n\nMr. Waterson: We have all learned to disbelieve figures quoted by the Liberal Democrats, but will the Minister comment on the figures published on Friday by Eastbourne district general hospital that show that, despite the extra money that has been invested recently by the Government, the number of beds blocked has risen since June--when it stood at 46--by so much that the acting chief executive said that the hospital had 75 beds blocked and a consistent flow of patients who need them?\n\nJacqui Smith: I do not have the figures for Eastbourne at my fingertips, but I know that like other areas it will have benefited from the extra investment and will be subject to the targets for reducing delayed discharges. Of course we need to tackle delayed transfers in order to make sure that the whole system works effectively, but I have to point out to hon. Members that, contrary to what the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam suggested, more operations are now being done in the NHS and waiting lists are down.\n\nWe know that there is more to be done. That is why, in October, we announced an additional £300 million--not £200 million--during this year and next for councils to work with their health and independent sector partners to tackle the delays and the causes of delay.\n\nRichard Younger-Ross: The Minister mentioned a figure of £300 million, but the directors of social services estimate that £1 billion is required. What will fill the gap between the £300 million that the Government are providing and the £1 billion that the experts in the field say that they need?\n\nJacqui Smith: That is not the first example, and I am sure that it will not be the last, of the Liberal Democrats calling for more money regardless of how we change the system. I will say more about the extra resources that the Government are putting in to personal social services over and above the £300 million, but the point remains that we have been willing to invest that sum in order to ensure that we can tackle delays.\n\nMr. Terry Davis (Birmingham, Hodge Hill): Is the £300 million intended to deal only with delayed discharges from hospitals or also with delayed admissions from the community?\n\nJacqui Smith: I thank my right hon. Friend for that intervention and I know of the good work that he has done in Birmingham on the problem of delayed discharges. As I will explain later, the investment in social services, and that £300 million in particular, has to deal with all the problems in the system, including funding projects that will ensure that people do not end up having to go into hospital, perhaps by providing better support in their homes, as well as ensuring that we have the capacity and the necessary services to get them out of hospital in a timely manner.\n\nMr. Heath: Everything that the Minister says shows that my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) is right to say that the Government are in denial. For example, is it not the fact that in Somerset the extra money that has been provided to deal with bed blocking is almost exactly matched by reductions in grants for other parts of social services? That means that no improvement is possible.\n\nJacqui Smith: No, it does not mean that as I shall explain later. I monitor carefully the figures for delayed discharges and can assure hon. Members not only that the trend is down, but that since last September there are fewer blocked beds and fewer people wait more than 28 days. The investment and the new services that it has brought are working, and the health service and its social care partners deserve congratulations on the progress that is being made.\n\nThe hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam made some points about care home capacity. The Government are well aware of those issues. Once again, however, the truth has been misrepresented. Figures show that the loss of beds during the past few years is nowhere near as high as the figure of 35,000 cited today, or the figure of 50,000 that has often been cited. Indeed, residential care and nursing home capacity is roughly the same today as it was four years ago.\n\nIt is nonsense to consider closures in isolation. Laing and Buisson's figures, for example, show that more than 33,500 beds were created between 1996-97 and 2000 as a result of new registrations. The net loss of care home beds during that period, according to Laing and Buisson, which has no axe to grind in the matter, was about 19,000. To claim a higher figure is both mischievous and misleading. After this debate, I hope that figure will not be used again.\n\nWhat must we do to maintain that capacity and to ensure that standards are what we would expect for our constituents who use those services?\n\nSandra Gidley (Romsey): I am listening to the Minister's comments with interest, but let us put the dispute over the historical figures to one side for a moment. When I visit care homes in my constituency, I am told that the wholly erroneous standards specified in the Care Standards Act 2000 are forcing them to make real decisions about the future. They have to decide whether they can afford to make those so-called improvements even though their homes already function perfectly. The owners are all drawing up plans to sell their large old houses for flats. What impact will the Act have on the number of future places in homes? Has the Minister made an assessment?\n\nJacqui Smith: I thank the hon. Lady for her intervention. We are witnessing a certain amount of confusion among Liberal Democrats this evening--certainly as regards their historic position. The hon. Lady seems to be suggesting that we should oppose the whole idea of setting up national standards, while the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam supported it. I take the impact of standards extremely seriously, as I shall explain later.\n\nMrs. Joan Humble (Blackpool, North and Fleetwood): Does my hon. Friend share my concern that the Liberal Democrats seem to be denying the need for care standards to protect elderly people who desperately need them? Is she aware that, when the Government held their widespread consultations on care standards, most care home owners in Lancashire told me that the standards were, by and large, examples of good practice. Those owners were already implementing such standards. If they had a concern, it was about building regulations. The Government responded to that concern by extending the period needed to convert the buildings to the new standards.\n\nJacqui Smith: I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I know that she has a close and good relationship with the care homes in her constituency. I shall talk about care home standards in a moment.\n\nIt is also worth pointing out that the Liberal Democrats have turned their fire on domiciliary care. Those services have never been regulated. I am interested to know whether the Liberal Democrat approach is that there should be no regulation of the whole sector that deals with care services provided to people in their own homes.\n\nMr. Burstow rose--\n\nJacqui Smith: Hopefully, we shall now receive clarification.\n\nMr. Burstow: I am more than happy to make it clear, as we did throughout the passage of the care standards legislation, that we support the introduction of national minimum standards but, as we pointed out, higher quality comes at a cost. The problem is that the Government are not prepared to write the cheque.\n\nJacqui Smith: I am glad that I gave the hon. Gentleman the chance to correct the impression that he gave in his original comments.\n\nIt is important to remember why national standards are being developed--that relates to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble). The old regulatory system for care homes is riddled with gaps and anomalies. Existing standards for care homes are set and administered in different ways by different authorities, and some homes are not regulated at all. I am sure that hon. Members will have heard--as I have--the complaints of care homes and users about the current inconsistencies.\n\nThe introduction of national minimum standards will mean that providers will be clear about the standards that they have to meet, and users and their carers will know what they can expect as a minimum. It is right to provide that protection and assurance for the vulnerable people who use our care system.\n\nAndrew George (St. Ives): The fundamental point is that, although we welcome the introduction both of care standards and of the increase in the minimum wage, there is an increasing mismatch with the money provided to social services. The Minister knows that, next week, I shall be meeting her with a delegation of representatives from health authorities, social services and the independent\n\nMr. Simon Burns (West Chelmsford): I certainly welcome this debate, but I must say that listening to the increasingly bitter exchanges between the Minister and the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow), I began to feel that I was intruding on private grief--it seems that the love affair between the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats is well and truly over if the early stages of the debate are anything to go by. It is amazing to think, Madam Deputy Speaker--and even you can think about it--that there was a great cosy love affair only 18 months ago. Lord Ashdown, the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) and the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Mr. Campbell) were all involved in a Cabinet Sub-Committee--the first time that that has happened since the time of Lloyd George. Tonight, we can well and truly see that that love affair is over. The bitterness of both sides is more than apparent, given the way they were at each other's throat.\n\nJust yesterday, it was widely reported that the elderly in Britain are being penalised by the NHS because of widespread health care bias and discrimination. Although that is deeply alarming, such discrimination is not a wholly new revelation. Indeed, such prejudice towards the elderly has increasingly manifested itself in another aspect of Government policy since 1997--long-term care for the elderly. Between 1998 and 2001, the number of general nursing homes in England fell by 13 per cent. During that relatively short period, nearly 22,000 nursing homes beds were lost and about the same number of hospital patients had their discharges delayed because there were no places available to look after them properly in the community.\n\nLess than one year ago, there were 525,900 places in residential settings for long-stay care for elderly and physically disabled people across all sectors.\n\nMr. David Hinchliffe (Wakefield): I am a little concerned by the fact that the debate seems to be concentrating on beds when community care should be about preventing people needing beds. How do countries such as Denmark, with a similar proportion of elderly and very elderly people, manage without any care homes whatever?\n\nMr. Burns: The hon. Gentleman raises an important issue concerning domiciliary care, and I will refer to it in my speech. The simple answer to his question is that the debate has revolved around beds because it is about the crisis in care. Unfortunately, the Government's record on what has happened to the number of beds over the past few years has helped to contribute significantly to the crisis. That is why the issue will be an integral part of the debate. I know that the Government do not like to hear bad news or, in many cases, the truth when it is unpalatable, but they will have to listen to it this evening without the fantasy, the spin or the denial of Ministers.\n\nMrs. Humble rose--\n\nMr. Andrew Turner rose--\n\nMr. Burns: I will give way when I have made some progress.\n\nAs I was saying, less than one year ago there were 525,900 places in residential settings for long-term care for the elderly and for physically disabled people across all sectors. That is a drop in capacity of almost 50,000 places since 1996-97. Indeed, 760 care homes were closed in 1999 alone, resulting in the loss of more than 15,000 beds. In anyone's mind--except that of the Minister, who does not seem to think that it is happening--that is an extremely alarming situation.\n\nI do not know about the Minister's constituency, but in mine two care homes have closed in the past 12 months. I suspect that most hon. Members--certainly those on this side of the House--will probably have experienced the same tragic situation. For some reason, it is not obvious to Ministers, who want to perpetuate the myth that everything is fine and that any fact or statistic that suggests otherwise is not true.\n\nMrs. Humble: I remind the hon. Gentleman that his Government introduced the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990. When the then Secretary of State for Health announced its introduction, he agreed with Sir Roy Griffiths who had been commissioned by the then Government to produce a report and who said that 25 per cent. of care home beds would be lost as a result of that legislation because it was deliberately designed to move people out of residential care and into a home care setting.\n\nMr. Burns: The hon. Lady must understand that one of the fundamental principles of community care was to examine where it was possible to allow people to remain in the familiarity and security of their own homes with domiciliary care packages. If there were a static population, that would lead to the loss of some beds because they would not be needed. The hon. Lady is talking about what happened 10 or 11 years ago and the elderly population has increased significantly since then. For a variety of clinical and funding reasons, many people have not been to able to remain in their homes. In recent years, care homes have closed and beds have been lost not because there is no demand for them, but because it is not viable for a variety of reasons--some financial and some bureaucratic and administrative--for them to be retained.\n\nThe other problem is that the closure of homes is not taking place where there is spare capacity. More often that not, it is happening in the south-east, the south-west and the eastern region, where there is the greatest demand, and that creates a greater problem. The situation is critical. A survey in May 2001 showed that more than 70,000 pensioners were forced to sell their homes in 1999 to pay for the cost of residential nursing care. That represented a near doubling of the 40,000 pensioners in the same circumstances when a similar survey was carried out in 1995.\n\nEven more worrying is the survey of 104 councils which showed that\n\n\"potentially more than a quarter of a million\"\n\npensioners have been forced to sell their homes to pay for care costs since Labour came to power. Is that what Labour meant when it claimed that things can only get better? That is not how most elderly people who have gone through that tragic process or who are fearful that it might happen to them would define getting better.\n\nMr. Burstow: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?\n\nMr. Burns: I want to make some progress first.\n\nThe Government have failed to address the problem for far too long. The average age of this country's population is increasing. Some demographic projections indicate that the provision of nursing home beds needs to expand by around 65 per cent. by 2031 if the population is to be adequately cared for. Yet with the number of beds falling, an even greater expansion--possibly as much as 100 per cent. over the next 30 years--will be needed to meet the target.\n\nMr. David Drew (Stroud): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?\n\nMr. Burns: No, I am going to make progress.\n\nThe Government can continue to spin the situation, to fiddle the figures and to call it what they like, but the stark fact is that there is a crisis in long-term care. They may refuse to recognise that, but Opposition Members are not the only people who live in the real world and understand what is going on. Frank Ursell, the chief executive of the Registered Nursing Home Association, has commented:\n\n\"The Government can rightly be accused of fiddling while a vitally important part of the health care sector declines before its very eyes. Inaction by the Government, coupled with chronic underfunding of services for older people, could mean that there will be insufficient long-term beds available in the years ahead.\"\n\nThe National Assistance Act 1948 is long out of date. Fortunately, the provision and the policy of caring for old people has moved on from the undignified and sole-destroying placement of the elderly in long-stay hospitals, where they had little comfort and little self-respect or dignity. That has gone, and I suspect that no one would object to that.\n\nWe have to ensure that community care is developed--I strongly support this policy--so that it provides the back-up and the freedom from fear that the elderly deserve in the 21st century. I am afraid that despite some welcome strides forward, such as the raising of standards, more has to be done to address the problem. The knock-on effect of the loss of nursing homes and beds is causing a critical problem with delayed discharge, or bed blocking. A vicious circle is emerging. The increasing number of residential home closures has led to further delays in discharging older people from acute hospital wards. Not only does that prevent them from leaving hospital, but it lengthens the waiting times for patients who want hospital treatment.\n\nThe situation is ridiculous. On 9 October last year, the Government claimed that approximately 6,000 beds were blocked by patients who were well enough to be discharged. On 15 October, the Daily Mail revealed that the real number of delayed discharges was 100 times higher. [Interruption.] The Minister says, \"It's wrong.\" It is not. I am worried that a Minister can sit there and, almost ostrich-like, blind herself to the reality of what is going on in the real world.\n\nAlthough the Minister says that the article was wrong, after the Daily Mail had pointed out that the Government's figures were wrong, the Government admitted that they were wrong: they had referred only to those beds blocked in NHS hospitals on any one day, leaving out the other 364 days in the year. There is no point in the Minister repeating like a parrot, \"It's wrong.\" It is not wrong. The Daily Mail also revealed that Department of Health statistics showed that over the course of the year, there were more than 680,000 elderly bed blockers. The Government insult the country by systematically refusing to accept what is happening. How are we to believe Ministers if whenever they are given information they do not like, they say it is not true?\n\nLast year in inner London, 11 per cent. of acute beds were blocked. In December, in response to a written question tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox), the Minister acknowledged that 36 per cent. of patients subject to delayed discharge were delayed in hospital for more than 28 days. That equates to almost 245,000 patients. How many patients could have received acute treatment had those beds been available and not blocked by people who had nothing wrong with them but had nowhere else to go?\n\nThe Government's policy and the knock-on effect of delayed discharge is having a profound effect throughout health care provision. Insufficient care facilities in the community mean that elderly people are being kept inappropriately in hospital, which in turn prevents those who need hospital treatment getting a bed.\n\nWe recognise that hospital is not always the most appropriate environment in which to care for elderly people. Wards tend to be noisy and overcrowded,\n\nwith individuals afforded little privacy. The Government have failed to meet their deadline for ending the use of mixed-sex wards. Even more disturbing is the high risk of elderly people in hospital acquiring infections: almost one in 10 of all hospital patients contract an infection during their stay.\n\nAlthough I welcome last October's announcement by the Government that they would release £300 million over two years to tackle delayed discharge, I agree with Sheila Scott of the National Care Homes Association, who described the sum as a \"sticking plaster\". With 680,000 bed blockers last year, 1,000 extra beds will do little to alleviate the problem that the money is intended to tackle. The vicious circle will continue to revolve until the problem of bed blocking and delayed discharge is brought under control. In the meantime, all care suffers. Under new Labour, we have been put in the ridiculous position whereby one is put on a waiting list to get into hospital and to get out of hospital.\n\nThe Government have failed on another key aspect of health care: free nursing care. Before the last general election--under new Labour, these things always happen just before a general election--the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State promised that there would be free nursing care in England as soon as its introduction was viable. Since then, the implementation of the policy from 1 October has not lived up to the expectations raised by that promise.\n\nMany people feel betrayed because they took the Government's words at face value and believed that everyone would receive free nursing care. They failed to realise that it was the Government who would define nursing care and personal care. Now, a significant number of people who thought they would be entitled to receive free nursing care have been told that they will not get it, because the care they need has been categorised as personal care. Some sufferers from Alzheimer's disease or dementia, for example, may not receive nursing care because it is judged that their care is personal care, and under the new policy personal care is not paid for by the system.\n\nsector to raise the issue of that increasing gap between the cost of meeting the welcome standards and improvements in the residential sector and the money provided for social services. That problem affects not only Cornwall but many parts of the country. The Minister must address that gap.\n\nJacqui Smith: I thank the hon. Gentleman for making that point. I have lost count of the number of Liberal Democrat demands for extra money but I shall deal with his point.\n\nThe way that we implement the standards is crucial. In particular, the focus of the National Care Standards Commission, when it takes over regulation and inspection in April, will be to work with providers to help them to meet national minimum standards. In practice, that means that if standards were not being met in a few respects the commission would note that in its inspection report and would write to the home owner giving reasonable time in which to make the changes.\n\nOf course, the point of national standards is to ensure consistent high standards throughout the country, not to close good homes. That is why, when we heard the results of the consultation, we made changes to the standards, putting off the environmental space standards until 2007 and ensuring that space could be used flexibly. However, I am determined that the standards will be introduced in a way that will safeguard users and maintain good homes. I will be discussing with industry representatives and with the National Care Standards Commission the details of the environmental standards, and how we can ensure that they are introduced in a way that promotes higher standards for users but does not drive high-quality care homes out of business.\n\nLocal authorities are rightly responsible for decisions about the fee levels that they pay. It was interesting to hear Liberal Democrat Members speak about the failure of some Liberal Democrat councils to live up to the enthusiasm of their Members of Parliament. However, fee levels should reflect the quality of care that we expect from care homes for our older people. That is why I welcome the fact that local authorities are using funding from the £300 million building capacity grant to buy additional places in care homes.\n\nA number of councils have drawn up new agreements--which include increased funding--with the independent sector, to stabilise the sector and ensure that standards of care are maintained. That will help to ensure that capacity is maintained locally, so that the right range of care services can continue to be provided to older people in the future.\n\nThe debate about care goes wider than care homes alone. The Government have also introduced a range of reforms to the long-term care system. Free nursing care in nursing homes was introduced on 1 October, as we had promised. The benefit is felt by more than 42,000 people, who could save as much as £6,000 per year. Councils have had extra money to introduce deferred payments, so that people do not have to sell their homes to go into residential care. Since last March, the value of a property has been disregarded for 12 weeks in the residential care means test, and capital limits have been increased.\n\nIt is important to maintain capacity and make the system fairer, but more of the same just will not do if we want to provide real choices and independence for our older people. I am encouraged by the figures that show that 5 per cent. more households were receiving intensive home care packages in 2000 than in 1999. About 1.5 million people now receive care packages of all types in their own homes.\n\nIn addition, the national service framework for older people, published in March last year, focuses on raising standards and promoting independence in services for older people.\n\nDr. Evan Harris (Oxford, West and Abingdon): Is not the Minister concerned that the 5 per cent. more people receiving intensive care packages at home might have come at the expense of the 93,000 fewer people who receive all types of care packages at home? Stealing from one group of vulnerable people to provide for another such group is a cynical tactic, not something of which she should be proud.\n\nJacqui Smith: I am sure that Liberal Democrat councils around the country will be interested to hear that Liberal Democrat MPs think that they are stealing when they make local decisions about resources. The important point is that local authorities and their health partners are using the extra resources that have been made available to find new and different ways to support old people's independence. That is to be welcomed.\n\nCentral to raising standards in the national service framework is the increased development of intermediate care services to provide rehabilitation, to support independence, to prevent people from going into hospital into the first place, and to help them back into their own homes after a spell in hospital. The extra investment in these services has already led to more beds, more places and more people receiving these services.\n\nA new advice and information line, Care Direct, went live in the south-west from 1 October, providing advice and information on health, housing, social care and social security issues. These types of services--new services that promote information and independence for older people--will be developed across the country. These and other initiatives already being delivered, totalling £1.4 billion from 2001 to 2004, will support older people more effectively and independently.\n\nRichard Younger-Ross: The Minister is generous in giving way again. She is good at blaming Liberal Democrat councils for what they do or do not do, as if we controlled the world. No party is in overall control of Devon county council, but the leaders of all the four political groups in that county--Liberal Democrat, Conservative, independent and Labour--came to lobby Devon MPs last week. They had but one message: that funding for Devon is inadequate, and that there is insufficient money for the SSA or for services for the elderly or for children. Devon's problem is that it cannot deliver enough money to the independent care homes. It recognises that, as do the independent care homes. How can the council improve the care standards--\n\nMadam Deputy Speaker: Order. An intervention is meant to be brief.\n\nJacqui Smith: I had started to speak about the extra resources going into local authorities. Some of those extra resources are, rightly, finding their way into new services and into increases in fees.\n\nThe hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam called the Government's policies quick fixes, or words to that effect.\n\nMr. Burstow: Sticking plasters.\n\nJacqui Smith: The hon. Gentleman called the policies sticking plasters, but not one of them is a quick fix. The accusation is ironic, coming as it does from Liberal Democrat Members. They think that the only fix is more money, more quickly.\n\nOf course we need to reform the system further: we need new services, new choices and new ways for health, social care and their independent partners to work together. That is why my predecessor established a high-level strategic commissioning group to give greater direction to the commissioning of care services for adults.\n\nThe agreement published by the group, which brings together representatives from a variety of organisations, sets out responsibilities and expectations for central Government, local government, the NHS and independent providers. It stresses the need for councils and the independent sector to enter into long-term agreements on placing people into care homes or giving them other forms of support. It will lead to improvements in the commissioning of services and therefore more choice and security for older people.\n\nThe Government have broken down the legislative barriers that prevented health and social services from working together, so that services are now beginning to be designed around what older people actually need and want rather than what fits administrative boundaries.\n\nWe need to see even more of that type of working. Of course, that needs more investment and resources and, yes, social services have been underfunded. That is why the Government have increased social services funding by more than 20 per cent. in real terms since 1996-97--an average annual real terms increase of 3.2 per cent.\n\nIncidentally, before we hear from the Conservative Opposition spokesman, I should say that that increase stands in contrast to an average annual real-terms increase of 0.1 per cent. in the last five years of the previous Government and no promise to match our social services spending at the last election.\n\nMr. Burstow: Perhaps we can have a quick reality check. Will the Minister confirm that the gap between what the Government say social services need to spend and what they actually spend amounts to £1 billion--a 12 per cent. difference? That is the reality, is it not?\n\nJacqui Smith: We are working with the Local Government Association to ensure that, as I have said, we continue to put extra resources into social services. In fact, the gap has narrowed in the past year. We are working to attract more staff through a recruitment campaign that we launched last year, and it has already attracted at least 14,000 responses. We are investing in training support to ensure that our care workers have the skills that they need.\n\nToday, Liberal Democrat Members have been big on calls for more money and short on vision or ideas for reform. The Tories will be big on complaint and low on investment. What people will get from a Labour Government is more investment, higher standards, more services, more choice, more independence and more hope for the most vulnerable people in our society. I commend the amendment to the House.\n\nMr. Burstow: I seek clarification. Is the hon. Gentleman advancing the view that personal care, like nursing care, should be free? Can he explain why his Front-Bench team, who in opposition took that measure through in the last Parliament, did not pick it up and did not deal with the complications of the Government's free nursing care scheme?\n\nMr. Burns: We fully support the provision of free nursing care, as we did before the last general election.\n\nDr. Evan Harris: Not personal care?\n\nMr. Burns: No, free nursing care. Like the Government, we also said at the last general election that we would not give a commitment to free personal care. We fought the last election on that policy, and so did the Government. I know the Liberal Democrats had a different view, but I am stating the policy on which we fought the last general election.\n\nFar too many people feel that they have been let down over the free nursing care promise, which has not lived up to expectations. The Government wring their hands and will not accept the evidence that any constituency MP is more than familiar with, especially if they live in the south-west, the south-east or the eastern region. They see homes closing down and being sold off for other endeavours. Homes are under tremendous financial, bureaucratic and administrative pressures. They are desperately trying to provide the highest standards of care for their residents.\n\nWe all support the idea of more provision of domiciliary care for people for whom it is a viable and rational option, so that they can remain in the security and familiarity of their own homes. However, there is a crisis, as the title of the debate on the order paper shows. It would be far better for the elderly of this country if the Government recognised the arguments and did more to help alleviate the problem, rather than pretend that it does not exist or that it will merely fade away.\n\nMr. David Hinchliffe (Wakefield): I welcome the debate. I shall probably break the consensus that has existed so far. I do not subscribe to the view that the success of community care policies can be evaluated on the basis of the number of beds in private care homes. I worked in the care sector for many years, including in care homes. My mother ended up in a care home, and that was the worst experience of my life. I do not want to end up in a care home. I think that we can do a damn sight better for our elderly people than sticking them in institutional care. As the Minister implied, it is about time that we showed vision and courage by moving in a more radical direction.\n\nI felt depressed when I listened to the criticisms of the Government, which were almost wholly based on the decline in the number of care beds. If community care is working, of course there will be a decline in the number of care beds. Reference has been made to people such as Sheila Scott, the chairman of the National Care Homes Association, and others whom I have known for a long time. I probably know more private care home owners than most hon. Members, and I have never known any who have been poor. Someone somewhere is making money out of the sector. I have not seen them walking away from the private care sector.\n\nI want to explore key areas that have not been touched on so far. I was surprised that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) did not mention the structural problems that have occurred as a result of the split between health and social care since the 1940s, which is a major area. I understood that Liberal Democrat policy was to do something radical about that, but perhaps they have moved away from that position.\n\nSomebody mentioned the National Assistance Act 1948, which set out local government services that were to be means-tested. There was also the National Health Service Act 1946, under which care was to be free. Since then, we have had difficulties in matching up the two parallel systems. In 1974, the Conservative Government moved more elements of local government health care into the health service, complicating matters even further. I worked in social services at that time, so I am aware of the difficulties involved in getting the two elements of the care system to work closely together.\n\nWe have talked about the royal commission on long-term care, which was proposed by the Labour party when I was a Front-Bench spokesman on community care policy. I claim no credit for the proposal, because it was the idea of my right hon. Friend the present Home Secretary, who is a good friend. It was right to try to develop a consensus on the direction that the long-term care of the elderly should take. Personally, I believe that the conclusion in the majority report was correct. The split between nursing and social care is unsustainable, and nobody has managed to define the two types of care. At the moment, the definition of nursing care is anything that a nurse does. What absolute nonsense. I think that the definition will be challenged in law; it is impractical and it will not last very long.\n\nMy Government have made tremendous progress on community care, and I concur with much of what the Minister has said. I fully and actively support many of the Government's reforms, but I do not believe that we yet have the right policy to tackle the divide between personal and nursing care. We will have to revisit that matter. I would go further and tackle the separate structures for health care and for social care. I do not want to rehearse arguments that I have been making for many years about having a common system delivering health and social care, but until we get that we will have problems.\n\nRev. Martin Smyth (Belfast, South): The hon. Gentleman and I have worked together over the years and I know of and share his concern. However, I must enter a caveat. In Northern Ireland, health and social services work together, but we still have the same problems with the availability of beds. We must deal with the financial structures so that one section is not holding back from another.\n\nMr. Hinchliffe: I have the greatest respect for the hon. Gentleman, whom I have known a long time. He has had a passionate concern about health and social issues for all the years I have known him. Obviously, he knows the Northern Ireland system far better than I do, but I understand that the problems there arise from the fact that although there is one common organisation, there are still separate budgets.\n\nThat brings me to my next point, which relates to the figures on delayed discharges which were given to the Health Committee. In October, we were told that 6,000 beds are blocked on any one day. That was the Government's figure. I do not know whether it is correct, but I have not seen a revised figure. We were also told that the cost of an acute bed averaged out at £120,000 a year, so a quick calculation tells us that blocked beds cost £720 million a year.\n\nI would bet my bottom dollar that for a small proportion of that sum, we could have got those people out into the community and cared for them more cheaply, more effectively and, from their point of view, more happily and in a more settled environment if we had a coherent organisation running the whole show. I make a plea for a common health and personal care organisation--a plea that I have been making in the House for the past 15 years. I hope that by the time my career in this place ends, I will have got somewhere on this issue. I look forward to the Minister tackling that point in her wind-up; my hon. Friend is really suffering this week.\n\nI turn now to a point that was not dealt with in great detail by the Liberal Democrats. The difference between the marked and welcome increases in NHS funding under this Government and the less positive developments in personal and social services funding is having a serious effect on our ability to unblock beds and tackle difficulties in the community. The Government told the Health Committee that the total gross expenditure on the NHS had increased by 8 per cent. in the last financial year. That is an impressive increase, and I welcome it. The budgeted personal social services expenditure for the same year went up by only 1.4 per cent. That is a big difference, and I am sure that the Minister understands the consequences.\n\nI was reminded of the consequences at my surgery only last Friday night, when a lady came to see me about her mother, an elderly lady who had been in hospital for a hip operation. She was on an orthopaedic ward and was told, to the surprise of her daughter, that she was fit to be discharged into a private care home. The daughter was told that she had to get on with getting her mother out because she was blocking a bed. The daughter felt that her mother ought to be transferred to a geriatric ward or into intermediate care, but she was told that her mother had to go into a private care home.\n\nThe daughter obtained a private care home place for her mother. Interestingly, she was told by the ward sister that because her mother had private resources she could fund her care and there was more pressure on her to leave than there would be on someone who would be funded in that care home by the local authority. I do not know whether that is true or not. If after making local investigations I find that that is happening, I may well draw it to the Minister's attention because I will be concerned; I am certain that she will share my concern.\n\nI differ from Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members on the use of the private market. In a week in which the Government have talked about making more use of the private market, it is important to look at the implications of relying on the private market in care provision. The hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) appeared to accept no responsibility for the current situation in the care home sector. However, he knows full well that his Government decided in 1981 to allow supplementary benefit payments to top up private care home fees. That unpublicised decision led directly to a massive explosion in private institutional care. As a result, huge numbers of nursing homes and care homes sprung up across the country. Mrs. Thatcher believed in stimulating the market; consequently, we are bogged down in the community care system and locked into the kind of debate that we are having tonight in which we worry about the number of beds that we have.\n\nThe huge explosion in private institutional care arises directly from the market's involvement. Figures that I obtained from the Library show that, between 1981 when that decision was taken and 1993 when community care changes were introduced, the Conservative Government spent £10 billion subsidising private care homes. How much could a proportion of that money have done to keep people in their own homes? There was money to put people in institutional care, but not to keep them out.\n\nMr. Burns: Will the hon. Gentleman help me? Is it not the policy of his Government and the Secretary State to use the private sector in the provision of acute health care as well?\n\nMr. Hinchliffe: I am still trying to explore what has happened this week; it has been an interesting experience for one or two of us. I referred to the use of the private sector in care because I fear the consequences of its use in the NHS, as the hon. Gentleman knows full well; he knows my feelings in great detail.\n\nMr. Drew: Following that point, does my hon. Friend agree that as a result of the Griffiths report the previous Government wrongly decided to demand that 85 per cent. of all moneys be spent in the so-called independent sector? They spoke about a mixed economy of health and social care provision, but it was nothing of the sort.\n\nMr. Hinchliffe: My hon. Friend is right; that decision pushed people into permanent, expensive institutional care when in many instances they did not need it.\n\nMr. Waterson: I have not lost the thread of the hon. Gentleman's fascinating argument, which is being followed closely by his own Whips. Will he comment places such as East Sussex, where well over 90 per cent. of care home beds are provided by the private sector?\n\nMr. Hinchliffe: I did quite a bit of research while advising the Labour Front-Bench spokesmen on community care for a number of years. In a sense, the problem in East Sussex arises from the use of the market. We found from my research that the market had gone for areas where there were large houses and where, in some but not all cases, there were larger elderly populations. We found that people were being moved out of inner London to places such as Sussex and Surrey, where there were more private care homes. The investment was not in the areas where they were living.\n\nMy concern is that the Conservative Government allowed the market to provide what was in the interests of the care home owners, not what was in the interests of the people who ended up having to occupy those homes. The solutions that those people got were not what they wanted. They wanted care in their own homes, or at least near to where they lived. Precisely the opposite happened.\n\nMy main concern about the use of the private sector is the way in which it invested in wholly outdated models of institutional care. There was no recognition that most old people do not want to go into a care home. Our country is unique in our reliance on institutional care. In Denmark, which is the obvious example, care homes were made illegal in 1988. Other models of care exist there, because care homes are deemed to be a humiliating form of care.\n\nThe models developed by the private sector in this country until recently were based on our old workhouse institution. Some of the care homes are not much better than some of the workhouse institutions of many years ago. I am sad to say that, and I am sorry that there have been attacks on the care standards legislation from the Liberal Democrats. [Interruption.] There certainly seemed to be attacks. I shall check the record. I was actively involved in exposing standards in the private care sector, where people were genuinely suffering.\n\nDr. Evan Harris: When he checks the record, the hon. Gentleman will see that our concerns have been about care standards that have not been funded and are therefore threatened. When he criticises care homes that are doing\n\ntheir best with the resources and staff that they have, he should reflect on the implications for the care home staff. Are they workhouse staff?\n\nMr. Hinchliffe: Of course not. I am speaking of the model of institutional care, which is a direct consequence of the workhouse system. It is its historical successor, whether the hon. Gentleman likes it or not. In 2002, it is about time that we moved away from a system set up in the 1600s. None of us here wants to end up in an institutional setting, but the debate assumes that we all want to end up there and that we all want to see more care home beds. I, for one, do not. I should like to see a gradual reduction in institutional models and a move towards the models that exist in other countries--\n\nRichard Younger-Ross: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?\n\nMr. Hinchliffe: No. I have given way enough.\n\nI should like to see a move towards models such as care link schemes and housing with care schemes. There are many in the private sector, as well as in the public and voluntary sectors, where intensive care packages are available so that people are not permanently institutionalised in their old age. The key challenge is to move away from costly, outdated institutional care and to develop alternative models of care within the community. That is what people want and it is about time we delivered it.\n\nI have studied the Liberal Democrat motion. As the Government amendment states, it relates more to the producer interest than to the consumer. The motion refers to the\n\n\"loss of homes and beds\"\n\nand is rooted in grossly outdated thinking. The Government amendment more accurately reflects my personal concerns and contains some vision of future developments. I am happy to support the Government this evening.\n\nMr. Nigel Waterson (Eastbourne): I am delighted to have the opportunity of taking part in the debate, and I am particularly pleased to follow the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe). We all feel for him in his personal voyage of discovery, as he finds out what modern Labour party policy is towards our health care system.\n\nIt is breathtaking to witness the sheer opportunism and cynicism of our Liberal Democrat friends in some of the matters that they choose to bring before the House, especially in view of the experience of some of us in East Sussex. For eight long, painful years the Liberal Democrats ran East Sussex county council. As I mentioned in an intervention, in every year they succeeded in hitting the bottom of the national league table as the lowest payers to the private sector of any council in the entire country. Interestingly, Sedgefield council was at the top of the table, but that is another matter. There was a combination of incompetence and political dogma. The Liberal Democrats were getting a bit excited about the remarks of the hon. Member for Wakefield, who speaks with great authority and knowledge on these matters. I do not want to upset him,\n\nbut I must say that they are philosophically very close on these issues. I am convinced that the attitude of the Liberal Democrats in East Sussex during the eight years to which I have referred was based on dogma and the notion that people should not be able to make a profit out of running private care homes. I am sure that that is what drove their attitude to private care homes in my county. Other people's experiences may differ and I am sure that we will hear more about that.\n\nRichard Younger-Ross: Value for money.\n\nMr. Waterson: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will say that to the people running private care homes in East Sussex--especially those that have gone out of business in recent years.\n\nAs I said, several different pressures were faced. First, the area was the worst paid of any in the country. Secondly, there was the dogmatic insistence of the Liberal Democrat-controlled county council of keeping open its county council-operated homes. My hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns), who is gracing the Front Bench, may not remember an Adjournment debate on 19 February 1997 on social services in East Sussex, which I initiated. He was the Minister who responded to the debate, in which I pointed out the disparity between what East Sussex county council was paying the private sector and what it was paying per bed per week for its own homes. At that time, the gap was a staggering £150 a bed a week. He said:\n\n\"When a local authority is complaining that it does not have enough money, I cannot understand how it can justify spending about £152 a person a week extra just by placing them in its own homes.\"--[Official Report, 19 February 1997; Vol. 290, c. 898.]\n\nHe calculated that the total amount that was being wasted from the social services budget in that way was £5 million.\n\nMore recently, in July 1999, I secured a debate on a similar subject. By that time, East Sussex was paying the private sector £209 a week, but it was paying for its own homes the equivalent of £401 a week. That is a difference of almost £200 for every single person in its homes. I am sure that that figure is now even bigger. In those days, it was difficult as a local Member of Parliament--I anticipate the points that the Liberal Democrats might make--to lobby the Government, whether Conservative or Labour, for more resources when the existing ones were being squandered by the county council.\n\nThe third factor that has been hitting care homes in my area very hard is the new standards that will be introduced in April this year. In principle, we are all in favour of better standards. It is right that there should be constant pressure to improve standards and make life better for people in care homes throughout the country. We have no problem with that, but the reality on the ground is that many homes have rooms that are the wrong size and do not have the facilities or the area of land that is necessary to expand their resources in the way the rules demand.\n\nThe details of the regulations were made available extremely late in the day. We should bear in mind the fact that this is a question not only of care home owners and operators, but of their bankers. For some time, banks that have previously been heavily committed in the care homes sector have stepped back and decided to wait and see how the new regulations impact on their existing and potential customers. That, too, has had a major impact on care homes in my constituency, It is worth considering the figures that were provided in answer to a parliamentary question that my hon. Friend the Member for Wealden (Mr. Hendry) tabled on 9 January 2002. The reply stated that in 1999, 48 residential care homes closed in East Sussex alone, and that in 2000 the figure had increased to 69. Five nursing homes closed in 1999 and 10 closed in 2000. Those figures are worrying. A rapidly escalating number of private homes are being forced to close through a combination of the factors that I have outlined.\n\nWe could face circumstances similar to those in Australia, where Government neglect over many years meant that the private care sector died, went out of business and had to be reinvented by the Government at vast expense--many billions of dollars--because there was clearly a need for it. East Sussex is not unusual in having such a high proportion--more than 90 per cent.--of care beds provided by the private sector.\n\nMore and more of our older people will need such facilities and they will have to rely increasingly on the private sector. As I said, East Sussex county council kept its homes open for several years. Some of them are simply not up to the task in the 21st century. Recently, I revisited such a home, Parker house, in my constituency. It was built in the early to mid-1960s, and its fabric is crumbling. The facilities do not fulfil existing requirements, and will certainly not fulfil the new requirements that come into force in April.\n\nThe now Conservative-controlled county council has consulted on whether Parker house should be closed. I do not want to pre-empt the process or suggest that I have any inside knowledge. However, I should be surprised if the consultation did not conclude that the home should be closed. However, in the run-up to the local elections in May, some prominent local Liberal Democrats will be beating their breasts and claiming that closing the home would be outrageous, and that old people would be thrown on the streets. We should tackle such cynicism head on, and I intend to do that. Liberal Democrats would be saying, in effect, that some of our older people should be consigned to third rate facilities and care. That is a reflection not on the dedicated and caring staff but on facilities that do not meet existing standards, let alone new ones.\n\nRichard Younger-Ross: Does the hon. Gentleman believe that the home should close or remain open and be refurbished? Does he have a view?\n\nMr. Waterson: I thought that I had expressed my view, but I repeat that I suspect that a decision to close the home will have to be made. I surmise that it could be refurbished, but at inordinate expense. If I had a magic wand, I would start again on the site and build something more modern and in tune with the needs of local older people, such as a resource centre that would meet many needs that are currently not satisfied. Again, that is not to due to the staff. I shall be interested to read \"Focus\" on the issue. I hope that Liberal Democrats are forewarned that their actions will be met with the force of the argument that I have just presented. I am sure that there are similar facilities around the country in which similar arguments apply.\n\nI want briefly to move on to the question of bed blocking, or delayed discharge, as I think it is more fashionable to call it nowadays. I have laid as much blame as I think appropriate at the door of the Liberal Democrats for the chaos in which they left the social services budget, and for their dogma over paying for the private care homes sector. However, the Government cannot escape blame, for two reasons. First, immediately on taking office, they changed the calculation formula for standard spending assessments so that the number of old people resident in East Sussex is no longer properly and fully taken into account by the formula.\n\nSecondly, we have this issue of bed blocking. We keep being told that it is being solved by extra inputs of cash from the Government. At one time, bed blocking seemed to be a phenomenon that occurred in the winter months. Nowadays--at least if Eastbourne district general hospital is anything to go by--it is a phenomenon that starts in the summer and gets worse in the winter. Indeed, it is an all-year-round phenomenon.\n\nThe hospital had a major problem with bed blocking before the last election, and--lo and behold--under pressure from myself and others, the Government put in extra cash to tide it over during the election period. Last summer, there was also a major problem. Speaking from memory, I think that 45 beds were blocked in June. That is the equivalent of a couple of wards, if we want to look at it in that way. More recently, the Government have put in some extra funding. But last Friday, the district general hospital commented that the number of blocked beds not only matched but was now rising above the figure for last June, despite the extra funding. The acting chief executive, Glen Douglas, said:\n\n\"Bed blocking is causing a considerable problem at the DGH. We currently have 75 beds blocked and a consistent flow of patients who need them.\"\n\nI have to tell the Minister that, whatever extra funds the Government have put into this problem, it simply is not working. We still have a major bed blocking problem.\n\nNorman Baker (Lewes): I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, especially as I missed the first few minutes of his speech. I share his concern about bed blocking, which affects my constituency too. Is he aware that the money provided by the Government has been allocated first and foremost to Hastings, despite promises by the county council? One of the reasons the problem of bed blocking in Eastbourne district general hospital has not been solved is that allocation by the county council.\n\nMr. Waterson: It would have been helpful if the hon. Gentleman had been here for the first hour and 45 minutes of this debate, but it is nice to have his company none the less. I am not in the business of making knockabout party political points, and I would have hoped that he would agree with me that the extra funds that the Government have produced are not doing the job. Whether the money is allocated to Hastings or Eastbourne is neither here nor there, particularly as a merger of the two hospitals is on the cards in any event.\n\nWill the Minister please promise to look again at the situation in Eastbourne? I appreciate that there are hospitals up and down the country that always have a story to tell about a lack of resources, but here we seem to have a genuine problem. I do not know whether the problem is administrative or endemic, or whether the money is not being disbursed properly, as the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) might have been suggesting. Whatever the practical reason for the problem, this extra money is not doing the trick. Far from bringing the figures down, we are heading towards them being twice the level they were at last summer, when they were already causing severe grounds for concern.\n\nTo echo my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns), the Government have created a situation in which we still have significant waiting lists not only to get into hospital, but to get out.\n\nMs Dari Taylor (Stockton, South): The state system for providing medical or social care is crucial and I welcome the Liberal Democrats' choice of topic for this Opposition day debate. However, I was taken aback by the language used by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow). I neither recognise the situation that he described nor believe that the elderly or the great majority of my constituents in Stockton would describe the care that they receive in similar terms. They most certainly do not see social services as Cinderella services. They see them as historically underfunded, but they also recognise the professionalism of the staff who run them, so they would object most strongly to the use of such language and the notion that they must wait for someone to die before they get a place.\n\nLet me explain to the Liberal Democrats. We have too many places and too many homes, not insufficient capacity. There is over-provision, so my constituents would find your argument untypical of the situation that they face. It has been said that district nurses are getting older. We have young district nurses. Many are being trained and many are impacting on the community that I represent. Your use of language suggests to me that you are seeking press coverage.\n\nMr. Deputy Speaker (Sir Michael Lord): Order. The hon. Lady must use the correct parliamentary language.\n\nMs Taylor: I am appropriately corrected. The language used by the Opposition seems to court press coverage, but it does not reflect reality.\n\nI shall not pepper my speech with statistics--an awful lot of those have been bandied around--because I want to talk about the reality that my constituency faces. Our health and social provision has developed into a health and social services partnership that has been awarded beacon status. It is innovative and it has high standards. There is a clear, professional and qualitative relationship between health and social security professionals. I hope that the Minister has time to acknowledge the value of the partnership's innovative capability. It is one of only five such partnerships to achieve beacon status and I say to Stockton, \"Well done.\" However, I would not say that everything is fine.\n\nThe partnership's policies are often innovative and they challenge a culture in which elderly and old people's residences are seen as coincidental. We do not see things that way and it is clear that my authority does not see things that way. I do not suggest to the House that the partnership is working to maximum effect. I am very realistic. I know that it needs time and that more, serious money is required. It needs space to accommodate individual needs, but my realism is appropriate. A dose of realism would stand Opposition Members in good stead.\n\nInevitably there are problems and some are historical. We do not need to be told what the Conservative Government did for 18 years. We all know what they did. We know that there are demographic problems and that there is an ageing population to accommodate. There are undoubted problems because we are challenging a culture. The remark of my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) was so appropriate--the elderly do not always want to go into homes and residences. I talked to elderly people when I worked in Sunderland and I talk to them in Stockton. Often they would choose to stay at home.\n\nI am not saying that there are no problems, because problems are inevitable when we propose change. I am especially conscious of the fact that stand-offs always arise when we change a policy relating to vulnerable people. People say, \"We would rather things stay as they are because we are not too sure of the quality that you will provide.\" We understand that and I am not saying that the partnership in Stockton is achieving all. I simply say that it is innovative, achieving change, responding to higher expectations and delivering better services. It is responding in such a way that individuals feel that they are prized in the community.\n\nA lot more has to be done, but a lot is being done. By speaking about my local authority and its relationship with the Government, I am speaking the truth. I am neither exaggerating nor underestimating the problems and opportunities.\n\nIt is difficult to see new policies delivering appropriate services, so it is valuable for all of us to hear the language used by professionals in my constituency on the Government's approach. The language of local policy- makers is invariably positive. Members might say that I would not quote them were it not. They would be wrong. It may be difficult but, as a policy-making Government, we have to face up to the problems as well as the opportunities.\n\nThe language used shows that partnership is valuable, as is supporting a fundamental change in culture. Establishing relationships between different professionals that are based on co-operation and support is valuable. Many of us in the House have professional backgrounds, and we are here because we want to deliver a policy or create a new approach. The partnership arrangements lead to co-operation. The days of ambivalence are becoming fewer and there is less indecision about whose responsibility a person is. Although all the problems have certainly not been solved, they are withering on the vine. Health and social needs are being handled holistically by partnerships such as mine, and we are achieving a much higher quality of care and support.\n\nThe director of social services for Stockton has said:\n\n\"Labour has done a lot\",\n\nadding that local flexibility was liked. The Secretary of State's remarks about freedom for local hospitals and local social services will provide the opportunity to develop services that respond to local needs. Stockton's social services director warmly welcomed that, and believed that it showed that his staff's professionalism was being recognised. The director said that they believed that a relationship of trust was beginning to develop.\n\nThis is not pie in the sky; it is something that we hope to achieve. We have to start somewhere, and my local authority is starting a positive relationship with the Government because the Government have given them the opportunity.\n\nMy local authority has adopted a principled approach to helping the health and social needs of the elderly in a care package known as homes for life. There is determination to establish a service that encompasses the needs of all older, vulnerable people within the broader community, and in which the richness of being part of a community remains. The elderly and the vulnerable have rights and they must have easy access to family and friends. Independence must be a fact of life. This well-rounded and well-thought-out policy maintains the individual's connections with the community. It should not require two bus journeys for a family to visit an elderly person, or a difficult journey for an elderly person to visit their family.\n\nThere are problems, and it is early days. We are in a period of transition, but at least we are in that period. Homes for life is a clear and principled approach, and a policy that will support independence.\n\nI wish to respond to the arguments about the private care sector and to refute categorically the challenge in the motion that Government policy has mishandled, and misunderstood, the home care sector, causing a loss of homes and beds. In Stockton, we have not lost any beds. I am the first to acknowledge that the relationship between the local authority and the private sector is not always easy, but no beds have been lost. Concern has been expressed about the amount of money that the local authority is prepared to pay for care and support of the elderly, but those concerns are now being resolved. Private owners are saying that that is because the Government have carefully organised the funding of social services in Stockton to allow private owners to pay appropriately. There has been disagreement, but it has been resolved and negotiations have taken place. Therefore, people in Teesside will wonder what on earth the Liberal Democrats have been talking about.\n\nWe do not have bed blocking either. We have two elderly people who have to be placed carefully in residential care.\n\nMr. Steve Webb (Northavon): Does the hon. Lady ever read a newspaper?\n\nMs Taylor: The hon. Gentleman thinks that this is funny. Good for him. The reality is that local people do not laugh about it. They are very grateful. As I was saying we do not have a bed blocking problem, but we have two people who need places. Where is the crisis? From the perspective of my constituency, my council and local private homes, the Government have achieved an innovative care system that is significantly better financed. It has a structure based on a partnership of equals between the public and private sector. It is a service based on the principle that people's individual needs, not profit, come first. It is also accommodating high standards. The local people know that it will take time for all those characteristics to become evident, but they know that we will persist until they do.\n\nThere is little evidence in Stockton of shortage of beds or bed blocking. In fact, there is much evidence that our policies are competent and achieving a much better service. There is no crisis. Unfortunately, in tonight's debate, the Liberal Democrats have been playing to the gallery. The language they have used is also used by my Liberal Democrat colleagues--and they are colleagues--on Stockton council. During a council debate, when the homes for life policy was introduced, it was warmly welcomed by the leader of the Liberal Democrats. However, when public opinion began to question the policy and the debate became a little bumpy, the Liberal Democrats immediately decided that a change of mind was the most appropriate response that they could make. I suggest that opportunism is the last thing required when a policy is being developed to respond to the needs of the old, the ill and the vulnerable in our society.\n\nStockton's approach--\"Homes for life, a life in your own home\"--is appropriate. That policy came about because the Government have allowed us to innovate and to challenge a culture; they have allowed us to say not only that we want quality, but that independent, individual lives should be accommodated in the social and health care system.\n\nNorman Lamb (North Norfolk): If only the whole country were like Stockton--it sounds like a paradise. I have never thought of Stockton in that way, but I learned much tonight.\n\nThe test of a civilised society is surely the way that it cares for its older people. Although I agree with the hon. Members for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor) and for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) that we should facilitate independent living wherever possible, it is not appropriate for everybody. Ideally, there will always be a place for residential care in a mix of provision.\n\nAt present, the vast majority of people who go into residential care go into the private independent sector, so the state of that sector should be of concern to us all. Despite the paradise in Stockton, that sector is in a state of developing crisis and I shall explain why.\n\nThe sector has suffered underfunding for many years. In Norfolk, year-on-year fee increases are below the rate of inflation. Last year, the Labour-Liberal Democrat council budgeted for social services spending of £13 million above the standard spending assessment, but it still overspent by £1 million.\n\nThe competing demands faced by social services departments put those departments in an impossible position--for example, as regards their child protection work. In Norfolk, we experienced the awful and desperately sad death of Lauren Wright. Part of the problem is that there are insufficient social workers. I pay tribute to the work they do, but there are not enough of them. Furthermore, there is not enough money to pay for an adequate number as well as providing sufficient funds for the care of elderly people.\n\nIn addition to the underfunding in fees from social services, the costs incurred by care homes over the years have continued to rise. They have had to cope with the minimum wage and the introduction of holiday pay. I fully support both those things, but they must be funded. The increases have not been enough to fund those extra costs.\n\nOn top of that, there are the new care standards. I repeat the comments already made by my colleagues on the Liberal Democrat Benches. We support national care standards. They are important, but it is essential that they do not act as a straitjacket that makes it impossible for inadequately financed care homes to meet them, with the result that the homes become unviable and have to close.\n\nThe effect of all those measures is that a substantial number of homes have already closed--35,000 beds have been lost nationally during the past three years--and there has been a dramatic drop in the number of new registrations. We have also heard about the knock-on effect for the NHS where blocked beds inevitably result in cancelled operations--despite the situation in Stockton--and longer waiting lists.\n\nThe homes that are most affected are those that rely on social services-funded residents, so the most disadvantaged residents lose out most as a result of the current inadequate funding. Furthermore, those residents also lose out due to the problems in the underfunded NHS--problems such as cancelled operations. They are unable to opt out as people with more money are able to do.\n\nFinally, I shall comment on the situation facing care homes for younger adults--residents with learning difficulties. That sector is the real Cinderella service. Recently, I visited an impressive home called Abbottswood lodge, which is situated in Swanton Abbott in north Norfolk. It is highly regarded locally and has received very good reports from social services inspection teams, but staff there are very worried about the impact of the new care standards on the home. They are especially concerned about the limits on the size of units and rooms in the home. They feel that the overly prescriptive approach will have a severe impact on their ability to continue to operate as a care home for younger adults.\n\nThe home is wonderful, an old vicarage with delightful grounds. However, the extent of the grounds cannot be taken into account in the prescriptive rules of the new care standards. The introduction of the national care standards requires sensitivity and flexibility.\n\nIt is time for some joined-up Government thinking, to quote a new Labour phrase. There needs to be a whole-systems review, so that we can judge the impact on the health service and on the care sector. It is time too that the whole system received proper and sustained funding.\n\nMr. David Drew (Stroud): I shall be brief, but various points remain to be highlighted.\n\nThe problem with the debate is that it is stuck in the past, whereas we should be looking to the future. However, I am not going to live in denial: there are problems in Gloucestershire. Recently, I met care home representatives from my constituency. Homes have closed there for a whole range of reasons, some of which have been noted already.\n\nYesterday, Lord Sutherland, Baroness Greengross and Ian Philp from the national service framework for older people addressed different meetings. Their various perspectives on the matter allowed hon. Members who attended the meetings to see the good things that are happening, as well as some of the problems with which we are all familiar.\n\nMy main aim in this debate is to make it clear that I think the mistakes that have been made are not necessarily the fault of this Government, or even of their predecessors. Although we could do some things better, the problem is that many previous Governments have failed to overcome the barrier between social care and health care. My hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) made that point very clearly.\n\nThe previous Conservative Government may not have been responsible for that mistake but, as I noted in an intervention, it was made worse by the way in which they tried to reallocate funds to personal social services as a result of the Griffiths report. As a result, the NHS was removed from the equation to too great an extent, and there was a failure to understand that it was not a mixed economy of care.\n\nMoreover, that period saw the beginning of the end of county-led provision, certainly in my county. I believe that that was wrong. There was also a failure to realise the opportunities for the mutual sector. I hope that that matter will be looked at again. There is a role for mutuality in this sector, as it overcomes some of the distrust that people feel for the private sector.\n\nI do not want to belittle the private sector. Some of my friends run care homes, and they are open about the fact that they want to make a profit. However, the private sector is not the only solution. We must give credence to mutuality, which is something from which we could gain considerable benefit.\n\nThe debate has already touched on various geographical and historical problems. Interestingly, the latest figures from Laing and Bouisson show that demand has not continued to rise exponentially, but has been capped. Perhaps that is a result of the way the funding mechanism operates, but alternatives are already being sought. Demand may grow as the population increases, but we must take demand into account as well as supply. The problem is not merely one of capacity: we must take account of what people want and where they want to go.\n\nThere is also a difference in expenditure. Again, I understand from House of Commons figures, drawing on Laing and Buisson's work, that approximately £9 billion is spent in the residential nursing sector, compared with just over £1 billion in the domiciliary care sector. Is that the right balance? Many hon. Members would argue that it is not, and we need to find a difference balance.\n\nIn trying to find some solutions, I would argue that the NHS has already moved too far out of the personal care sector. The NHS is invaluable precisely because it is the most trusted of organisations. Despite its various problems, it has a notion of how to deal with people, and we must ensure that that is carried into the personal care sector.\n\nAs I have said before in the Chamber and in Westminster Hall, there are different ways in which we can ensure that people are properly accounted for when they enter the system. In the United States, systems called minimum data sets provide a much better understanding of how people in the system can be moved more effectively. I hope that the Government will consider some of the pilot work that has been done in the Bristol area and try to roll it forward towards a national system. That involves using information technology effectively, but if that can be done people will not be lost but will be funded appropriately and they will feel that they are being listened to much more.\n\nAnother concept worthy of mention is that of supporting people, which has not been mentioned at all in this debate. It is important because for the first time it genuinely locks housing into social care and health provision. People often want to go home when they leave hospital--they do not want or need to go into the residential or nursing home sector--but perhaps cannot do so for the simple reason that their homes have not been adapted, and we must highlight that problem. I have done a lot of work locally and nationally with Care and Repair, and through other home improvement agencies it can lock into that exciting debate.\n\nA final issue is that of intermediate care. I shall not try to define it here tonight; the Government have much cleverer people than me working on that, but we could consider the way in which the NHS and others can provide the appropriate facilities for older people and the other groups mentioned--the vulnerable people--by pursuing intermediate care.\n\nTo give it a quick plug, Standish hospital will no longer be used for acute provision after 2004, so it could be considered for use as an intermediate care centre. In the years to come, I shall write to Ministers to advocate that solution, but that much-loved institution should be considered properly. If such things happen in the NHS, some of the pressure will be taken off the care sector, and we shall ensure that we do not view the solution as lying entirely in private provision. That would be neither fair nor realistic to the private sector; nor would it represent an appropriate use of state resources--people's resources--and we could have a much better system accordingly.\n\nDr. Richard Taylor (Wyre Forest): I shall be very brief. I am one of those hon. Members who still has not decided which way to vote this evening or, indeed, whether to abstain, but I have found all the contributions extraordinarily interesting and very helpful.\n\nI am delighted that we have been reminded of the importance of care in the community, yet I am pleased that the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) reminded us that care homes are essential. One of my constituent's comments about his father were published in the Daily Mail. My constituent said:\n\n\"He spent two weeks in residence and enjoyed it so much that he decided to continue to live there.\"\n\nSo care homes are right for some people.\n\nI welcome the opportunity to expose the enormity of the task that the Government face. I agree with them absolutely that investment alone is not enough unless it is matched by reform, but the enormity remains. If the £300 million investment announced in October is broken down into counties, Worcestershire received £713,000. If all that money had been spent on residential care, it would have been enough to provide less than one extra place a week. I am not criticising the amount, but merely pointing out the enormity of the task.\n\nThe cost of care is not met by social services in my county. I would almost like to arrange a visit to Stockton to see how it does that. Care homes in my constituency hope to take large numbers of fee-paying patients because they subsidise those who are paid for by social services.\n\nI shall end my brief contribution with a plea from the chair of the care homes association in Hereford and Worcester that the Minister might have seen. He writes:\n\n\"In 2001/2 Worcestershire receives £53 million in respect of payments for Residential and Nursing Care and Domiciliary Care. However, due to political decisions in the Council Chamber, only £33 million is used for the purpose intended\".\n\nWill the Minister investigate that claim? If it is correct and if it applies to other parts of the country, will she take action?\n\nSue Doughty (Guildford): I enjoyed the news from God's own county. It is very much a contrast to life in Surrey. My father is 80 and lives in Yorkshire and I have told him. \"Don't come south. Stay in Yorkshire.\" [Hon. Members: \"Go to Stockton.\"] I am not going as far as Stockton.\n\nMany Members have spoken about what is almost crisis management and the problem is not that we resent it if care homes make a profit. Any business can stay in business only if it makes a return on its investment. The cost of living and the price of property is so high in Surrey that investing in care homes involves a bad return on investment. That is the problem.\n\nWe still want good-quality care homes and we support high standards in them. However, we recognise the need to fund the provision of that care. Those of us who have constituents who have been bedridden for more than a year as a result of poor care have plenty of reason to desire improvements to the standard of nursing in some care homes.\n\nWe are in crisis, but the Minister would be hurt if I did not recognise the contribution that \"cash for change\" has made to bed blocking in Surrey. Even though, as in other areas, there have been massive queues in accident and emergency departments and even though people have been virtually imprisoned in wards in the Royal Surrey hospital, some improvements have been made. Notwithstanding that, we need ongoing planning so that care homes can plan. Furthermore, we need the money to train and pay care workers to look after people in their homes. Without that funding and without the recognition that counties cannot pay with money that they do not have, we will make no progress.\n\nSome care workers in Surrey work for 10 hours a day, unpaid for some of the time. They do not have enough time in the day to look after people, and that is not good enough. We need to treat people with decency. One of the problems is that there are not enough care workers in Surrey because they cannot afford to live there. However, we cannot bring them in from overseas, as we can nurses, because they are not at national vocational qualification level 3. People advertise throughout the country, but no one responds and we cannot bring people in from elsewhere. Consideration must be given to that point.\n\nWe have not touched on care for those who care for others. Although we have considered the revolving-door syndrome and bed blocking, a report commissioned by Help the Aged shows that one third of all carers over the age of 75 provide 50 hours of care a week. Three quarters of older people who live with the person for whom they care receive no regular visits from health or social services. One in 10 older carers who live with the person whom they look after receive home care themselves. Carers over 75 are more likely to be providing intensive care than those between 60 and 74. By 2031, nearly one in three of the population will be over 60.\n\nWe all want people to lead happy and healthier lives, but we have to recognise that we not only have to meet the current crisis but have to plan for the long-term needs of the population. We need long-term, consistent planned growth, based on realistic costs of providing social care of a quality that not only meets Government objectives, but provides plain and common decency for our older people.\n\nMrs. Patsy Calton (Cheadle): The Government amendment implies that all is improving in care for the elderly. The simple truth is that it is not. Every word of the Liberal Democrat motion will ring true with social services departments, the health service and, more important, users of the services and their carers up and down the land--perhaps with the exception of Stockton.\n\nThe Government are not doing enough in the round and the problems start with local government finance. I speak as a past chair of social services in Stockport, where we welcomed many of the social care modernisation reforms demanded by the Government. We are proud of working jointly with the health service and the voluntary sector, and we improved our management and record keeping. Basically, we did our best and the social services department in Stockport continues to do its best against both a backdrop of structural problems associated with local government funding of social services departments and a general backdrop of underfunding of local authorities in many parts of the country.\n\nI wish to explore two issues. The first is the structural problem caused in budgets by the chronic underfunding of children's services. In Stockport, crude standard spending assessment measures do not reflect the levels of need of children within our community. The knock-on effect of meeting the needs of children's services is to steal money from older people's services, with the resultant increases in gatekeeping. That reduces social services departments' ability to provide the right service at the right time for the elderly. All too often, money has to be spent on firefighting instead of ensuring a dignified and supported older age for the infirm. The lack of funding in older people's services leads to bed blocking and to entry to residential care, two outcomes that the vast majority of older people and their carers do not want.\n\nThe second issue that I wish to explore is the shortsighted way in which the Government tackle the problems. By the time someone becomes infirm, it is almost too late to engage in issues to do with lifestyle and diet. All the evidence indicates that as our young people get older, their sedentary lifestyle and poor diet, which we know is causing obesity, will lead to greater dependency when they reach an older age. The Government are engaged in pilot schemes such as the school fruits initiative, but they need to do much more to counteract the insidious effect of junk food and drinks machines in school corridors and sports centres throughout the country. Young people used to engage in more vigorous activity in schools, and more needs to be done to establish a better balance between activity and academic work in their lives.\n\nIn addition, more attention needs to be paid to the difference that local authority leisure services can make. France, for example, spends eight times as much on sport per head as we do. Leisure services are also often starved of cash because of the needs of other departments, like social services, that are busy firefighting.\n\nI am disappointed that four and a half years on, a Government with a big majority have not come up with proposals to replace the discredited local government finance system. Until they do, SSAs will continue to fail to meet people's needs and the improvements demanded by the Government cannot be implemented.\n\nDr. Evan Harris (Oxford, West and Abingdon): We have had a good debate, started by my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow), who stated the position clearly and backed up his remarks with evidence. It is important to provide data as well as solutions to the problems we see.\n\nUsing House of Commons Library figures derived from Government answers, my hon. Friend demonstrated that there are bottlenecks and delays in the health service. In the last year, 1,400 years of elderly people's time has been spent waiting to get out of hospital. The Minister may dispute those figures--perhaps she thinks it is only 1,300 years. However, the facts are clear and the Government must acknowledge them before they can claim that they are starting to solve the problem.\n\nMy hon. Friend demonstrated the loss of beds and homes in the care sector. He pointed out the cash shortages affecting many social services authorities, leading to a macabre game of musical beds wherein people who require funding can be placed only when one or more care home residents who are funded die. What a sad game to which to subject the elderly people of this country.\n\nMy hon. Friend further demonstrated the diminishing eligibility criteria caused by cash shortages, which lead to ever fewer people qualifying for any help from social services, as well as the staff shortages, vacancies and high turnover. Sensibly, he called for a review of the social care sector. In a thoughtful contribution, the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) pointed out how much thinking is needed in that respect. An independent review of how to get best practice across the country, new thinking and the funding required is long overdue.\n\nNot only have the Liberal Democrats come up with that proposal, but we are prepared to state that we would put in extra investment and to say where that funding would come from. We have talked about extra investment to tackle delayed discharges. According to figures given by the Chairman of the Select Committee on Health, tackling delayed discharges in one year would release £720 million. In addition, we would free councils to raise revenues, as voters elected them to, to meet the needs of local people.\n\nUnlike the Labour party, the Liberal Democrats said at the last election that we would be prepared to increase taxation, including setting a new top rate of 50p in the pound for incomes exceeding £100,000. According to Government figures, that would yield an additional £3.7 billion to spend on elderly people, including those in health care settings.\n\nMinisters may disagree with asking better-off people to pay more to help the most vulnerable in society. I think that to do so is wrong, unreasonable and a betrayal of their principles. They cannot deny that we went into the election with a costed manifesto to deliver whatever cash the Labour Government had to spend plus £3.7 billion derived from having the courage to ask the better-off to help to protect the most vulnerable people in our society.\n\nMinisters and their yes men and women on the Back Benches should be ashamed of having lacked the courage to say before--not after--the election that taxes would have to rise. They ruled out the only fair way to raise those funds, which is progressive direct taxation rather than stealth taxes. I suspect that many Labour Members wish that their Government's policy was different.\n\nThe Minister's response was astonishing, but nothing we have not heard before: \"Crisis? What crisis?\" She was eloquently and loyally--I hope it is worth it--supported by her hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor), who claimed that there was no problem of elderly people requiring earlier discharge or better services. The hon. Lady was prepared to say that there was a \"demographic problem\" but added that these are the early days of the Labour Government. If these are the early days, lord help those who need help when the Government have got into the swing of things. She said that there were no lost care homes and no problems, and only two elderly people were suffering from delayed discharge. The Government's new policy to modernise the health care system will be to tell people who want to be discharged from hospital to go to Stockton.\n\nBy contrast, we heard testimony from my hon. Friend the Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) about the problems in Norfolk, from my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle (Mrs. Calton) about the problems in Stockport, from the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) about the problems in his constituency, and from my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Sue Doughty) about the problems that still exist in Surrey. In my own constituency, care homes that had survived years of Tory cuts had to close under a Labour Government, and now there is a shortage of beds and a huge increase in the number of delayed discharges in my local hospital.\n\nIt is remarkable that the Government refused to acknowledge those problems. The Minister admitted that there was a need to stabilise the private care home sector. If it needs stabilisation, that implies that there is already a problem. What does stabilisation mean? It means rescuing the situation, and she should admit that her limited funding is designed to do that.\n\nThe Minister's response was clever but unfair. She chose to centralise praise for the Government every time new money was announced, but decentralise blame to local councils when underfunding led to cuts in provision. She was supported in her tactic of blaming local councils--a few of them Liberal Democrat, but most of them not--and attacking the Labour-led Local Government Association by the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) and the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner), who did not even remain in the Chamber to hear the rebuttal of his weakly put point.\n\nThe Minister talked about £300 million to tackle delayed discharge and to stabilise the private care home sector. That is not £300 million a year: it is £100 million in the first year and £200 million in the second. We are used to such double counting, but social services departments despair of it. We do not even know whether that will be recurrent. We certainly know that it is not the £700 million that the independent King's Fund has established is required, and which would provide at least at much by releasing those acute beds, as the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) said.\n\nThe Minister does not put enough money in, but claims praise for the money that she does provide. She blames hospitals for delayed discharges by naming and shaming them, and by giving them zero rating when they are unable to discharge patients and do not have the capacity to admit others.\n\nMinisters stand at the Dispatch Box and praise staff in the care home sector, but when care homes cannot afford to pay staff adequately they blame the employers. The Minister claimed that 5 per cent. more people receive intensive domiciliary care, and praised the Government for that. She blamed local councils for the fact that 19 per cent.--93,000 people--receive less care. She probably thinks that it is a triumph that people who do not qualify for care under the tightened eligibility criteria are happily living independent lives, but they are heading more quickly towards high-level care because of the failure of early intervention.\n\nThe Minister's claimed to have tackled the problem through the establishment of the high-level, strategic commissioning group. Bully for her! That group has come up with fantastic ideas such as long-term contracts. Of course long-term contracts are a good idea, but long-term funding to go with them would be helpful.\n\nThe contribution of the hon. Member for Wakefield was interesting. At least he accepted that there was a capacity problem. Like us, he accepted that the ideal would be independent living and less institutional care. Although care homes are suitable for some people, we should not assume that they are suitable for everyone.\n\nThe hon. Gentleman said that he disapproved, as he has always done, of the structural divide between health and social care: what the Government describe as a Berlin wall, and what my local trust and social services department describe as a Berlin trench, as they are digging to find the funds to fulfil the extra duties imposed on them by Government. We agree with the hon. Gentleman on that point. He accepted that 6,000 people suffer delayed discharge on any one day, and he pointed out that it would save £720 million if that problem were tackled. Again, he agrees with us and our motion.\n\nThe hon. Gentleman said that social services were underfunded compared with the health service, and that the real-terms increase in social services was not keeping pace. Again, he agrees with our point of view. He criticised the Government for their non-evidence-based love affair with private sector provision of social care. He supports us in almost everything, but then announces that he will support the Government in the Lobby tonight. Wheels within wheels. If the hon. Gentleman disagrees with the Government but will vote for them when the crunch comes, it is not scrutiny but tribalism. I say with the greatest respect, because the hon. Gentleman is bigger than me, that those who agree with our criticisms ought to follow the logic of their position.\n\nThe hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns), one of the few Conservative Members in the Chamber tonight, confirmed in an honest speech that his party in opposition is committed to funding only nursing care, not personal care. [Interruption.]\n\nMr. Burns: I am not going to change my mind. I shall state my position clearly so that there can be no misunderstanding by Liberal Democrats, because we all know what Liberal Democrats do in our constituencies. I said that, like the Government, the Conservative party fought the last general election on a policy of free nursing care, but we did not have a policy of free residential care.\n\nDr. Harris: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman repeated his position; I just wish that he had done so a bit more quickly. The hon. Gentleman does not understand, or perhaps he does, that such a policy discriminates against elderly people. It subjects them to the degrading assessment of whether bowel care, catheter care and stoma care is nursing care--that is, a requirement of their health needs--or personal care. What a way to treat elderly people. The Government are saying to them, \"If that care need is delivered by a nurse, we'll pay for it, but if it is not, you'll pay for it. Having saved and paid taxes all your life, you will pay for care that you were told would be free from the cradle to the grave.\"\n\nDr. Tonge: Does my hon. Friend agree that the policy also discriminates against elderly people who are not only physically but mentally ill?\n\nDr. Harris: Absolutely. We know that people who suffer from dementia will have a mixture of personal care needs and nursing care needs, and it is degrading, discriminatory and invidious to try to make a distinction between them. We are prepared to say that we would fund personal care, and we have said where the money would come from. I know that there are Labour Members who know, in their heart of hearts, that that is the right policy.\n\nThe hon. Member for West Chelmsford did us the favour of quoting Liberal Democrat research, the aim of which, as I think he accepts, was to show that people still have to sell their home to fund their personal care even though the Labour party, in opposition, used to claim that that was a scandal. Very little has changed.\n\nThe charges that the Minister must answer are clear. Discharges are delayed, beds are blocked and elderly people have to wait to receive suitable care in an unsuitable setting, which means that other elderly people who require that care have to wait to get into a hospital bed. Indeed, in many places, they have to wait in corridors, with the resulting lack of privacy. Who would have thought that five years into a Labour regime we would see wards made up in corridors, with no screens, no privacy and no dignity, and health care staff struggling to provide the care that patients need?\n\nThe Government stand charged with presiding over a system in which 19 per cent. fewer people are receiving social care because of the shortage of cash. They stand accused of under-resourcing that threatens the quality standards that Liberal Democrat and Labour Members want to see. The Government are committed to more tax cuts for the better-off at the expense of services for the less well-off. They are denying elderly people the free\n\nprovision of personal care on the NHS and subjecting them to degrading and invidious assessments. They are overseeing the tightening of eligibility criteria by local councils, which they are making the scapegoats.\n\nWe want to hear the Minister accept that there is a problem, that funding as well as reform is needed and that the Government have the courage to say where that funding will come from. We believe that the better-off who have done well under this Government should help to provide care for the vulnerable elderly who are getting a raw deal from the Government.\n\nThe Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Ms Hazel Blears): The Government believe strongly in giving people the right treatment at the right time in the right setting. We have had a wide-ranging debate, but I was particularly disappointed by the contributions of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow), who opened the debate, and the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris), who closed it for the Liberal Democrats.\n\nThere were good contributions in between, but it was extremely disappointing that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam used incredible and unbelievable figures, from which he extrapolated beyond the bounds of comprehension to talk about 5,000 years and 88,000 operations. Where would he get the surgeons to do those 88,000 operations? He was utterly unreasonable and went on to insult care home staff in the most appalling manner that I have witnessed in the Chamber for a long time. To talk about them as rejects from Tesco and McDonald's, when they are putting in time and energy and showing commitment to looking after people in care homes, is dreadful.\n\nI am disappointed that Liberal Democrat Members spoke almost exclusively on behalf of care home providers. That is nothing new. When the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon moved a motion at his party conference last year, he spoke 26 times about doctors, nurses and staff, but only once about patients; they are important, but he spoke about them only once.\n\nDr. Evan Harris: I know that the hon. Lady follows the Liberal Democrat conference carefully; I just wish that she would take note of the fact that the motion was about staff in the NHS. When we talk about staff in the NHS, we talk about staff, not stabilisers or modernisers.\n\nMs Blears: When we talk about partnership, we talk about a partnership of staff and patients working together to shape services; that is the difference between the Liberal Democrats and the Labour party.\n\nWe appreciate that the independent care home sector is facing a number of challenges; we are certainly not in denial about the issue. However, the position is nothing like the one represented by Opposition Members. Let us have a bit of honesty in the debate--it would make a refreshing change for the Liberal Democrats. Figures have been bandied about; the loss of care home places was said to amount to 50,000 beds. It went down to 35,000 beds, but the true figure is 19,000 beds. Those figures are ludicrous. I am glad that Liberal Democrat Members reduced their first figure by about half; perhaps by the end of the debate we shall have the proper figures. They did\n\nnot take into account the fact that 33,500 beds were created between 1997 and 2000 by new registrations. They should be clear about the figures that they submitted.\n\nOur policy is to allow people to remain as independent as possible and be supported at home, which is why 1.5 million people are receiving care packages of various types in their own homes. Last September, the number of people receiving intensive home care packages was 3,500 higher than it was the previous year. My hon. Friend the Members for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe), for Stroud (Mr. Drew) and for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor) spoke imaginatively and creatively--[Laughter.] I am sorry, it appears that Liberal Democrat Members do not recognise imagination and creativity when it stares them in the face.\n\nMy hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South spoke passionately about the local partnership in her community that is beginning to design facilities around the needs of patients. My hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield said correctly that we must not judge our success in community care by a simple number-crunching exercise involving the number of beds. We must look at the kind of services that we provide to support people in the community.\n\nMy hon. Friend the Member for Stroud mentioned, extremely importantly, the role of the mutual sector in drawing up new solutions to those problems. The Secretary of State in his speech yesterday talked about new models of care. The mutual sector has a role to play. I have recently been made aware of a project in St. Helens in which the co-operative movement is looking at providing a range of services--not just residential care, but supported housing with care services in place. When someone begins to become frail, they can get day care; when they are a little more frail, they can get sheltered housing; when they need residential care, they move into that; when they need nursing care, they move into that. They do all of that within the same village community in which their carers and families are involved. That is the kind of new model of care that local people want, and which the Government, with their creativity and imagination, will begin to put in place. The Liberal Democrats have simply spoken about more money for business as usual and the same old system. That simply will not wash.\n\nSolving delayed discharges is important to us and we have made tremendous progress. Since last September there has been a 10 per cent. drop in the national number of delays. We are keen that the figure should fall even further, which is why we announced the investment of £300 million. I am pleased to tell the House that by 6 January 501 beds had been freed across the country.\n\nRichard Younger-Ross: I thank the Minister for graciously giving way. She makes the situation sound rosy, but can she explain the following statement from all 15 local authorities in the south-west, including Labour-run local authorities? They state:\n\n\"Local Authorities are placed in an impossible situation with no recourse other than to hold back spending on older people in order to provide marginally safe and adequate services for children and other adults.\"\n\nIs that the rosy garden that the Minister is painting?\n\nMs Blears: I was not painting a rosy picture. I acknowledge that there are problems. The Government are not in denial. We are dealing realistically with problems in the community. If local authorities are taking that position, after they have received extra resources from the cash for change programme, it is outrageous that they are not putting in place services for older people. We will look into the matter.\n\nAbout 2,500 more people will be able to leave hospital at the appropriate time as a result of the extra funds that we have allocated. The hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) stressed the need to ensure that that happens in his area. I shall examine the distribution of the allocation of those funds in his area, but I understand that the Conservative-controlled county council there has cut grants to carers, leaving them without respite care. That is a serious matter, which will not help the situation.\n\nMr. Waterson: Before the hon. Lady hands out brickbats, she should bear in mind that a few short months ago, the Conservatives took over a social services budget in chaos, brought about by the Liberal Democrats. I hope that she will also address the point that I made--that the Government changed the SSA calculation for East Sussex to disadvantage central Government funding for older people.\n\nMs Blears: If the hon. Gentleman wants to argue with the Liberal Democrats, I shall not intrude.\n\nThe agreement last year, \"Building Capacity and Partnership in Care\", set out a new way of providing long-term care for older people. It envisages long-term partnership, joint commissioning, new forms of service and the development of new models. It will give us the sustainable system that we need. The hon. Member for Cheadle (Mrs. Calton) spoke of the need for long-term planning. That is the aim of the agreement.\n\nSeveral hon. Members mentioned free nursing care. On 1 Oct 2001 we delivered on our commitment to provide free nursing care for everyone in England. Some 42,000 people will save money on their nursing home costs. We are moving away from a means-tested system of nursing care to one based on clinical need.\n\nWe have been much maligned for failing to follow the Scottish Executive and offer free personal care to all, but to implement free personal care for everyone in England would cost approximately £1.5 billion a year. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield takes a different view, but we decided in the NHS plan to make £1.4 billion available per annum to improve services and standards for older people. Spending a vast amount of public money on free personal care would not guarantee improvements for older people. We firmly believe that we have targeted resources so that those most in need will receive high quality care at no cost. It is important to decide the right priorities. It is right for a Labour Government to target funds on those in most need.\n\nDr. Harris: The Minister defended her refusal to follow up the recommendations of the majority of the long-term care commission by saying that the funding required would have to come from other vulnerable groups. What about the proposal to raise the funding from the better off in society through fair, progressive, open taxation?\n\nMs Blears: As usual, the Liberal Democrats want to face both ways at once. One could say that they want to\n\nhave their cake and eat it. They want to ask the better-off to pay and to implement free personal care that will, in many cases, benefit those who are better off rather than those who are in most need. There is a fundamental contradiction in their policies.\n\nIt is all too easy to spread a mood of doom, gloom and crisis. I challenge Opposition Members to do some hard thinking. I know that that is not easy for them. It is much easier merely to complain and sit on the outside carping and criticising, rather than to come up with constructive new ideas. I am asking them to propose new models to put people at the centre of the service and to design facilities around their needs, rather than to force them into ideas and traditional care that can sometimes rob them of their dignity and independence.\n\nThis debate has highlighted some very real differences between the Labour Government and the Liberal Democrats. We put patients and the public first; they put providers first. We want creative and imaginative solutions; they want more places in nursing homes. We want to promote people's independence; they want them to be passive. We want a partnership between the national health service, local government, the voluntary sector and the private sector; they simply want to concentrate on care home numbers. We are forward looking; they are stuck in the past. We are creative and positive; they are negative. We are committed to reform; they have the same old ideas.\n\nThere is a lot more for us to do, but we are putting in the investment and reforming the services. The two must go hand in hand if we are to deliver the top-quality care to which people are entitled in this day and age. As ever, the Liberal Democrats are guilty of political opportunism of the worst kind. They just want more money, as usual--the same old record--but they do not want any reform; they just want the same old system.\n\nThe Tories are just as bad, but they are not even prepared to put the money in. The only thing that the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) could find to talk about was age discrimination. I am delighted to tell him that the Government's national service framework addresses for the very first time the rooting out of age discrimination throughout the national health service.\n\nThe hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) again raised the very sad case of Lauren Wright. I spoke in the Adjournment debate on the case and, as I recall it, the director of social services in the area was honest and open, and recognised that his problems stemmed not from a lack of funding, but from the systems that were in place and the difficulties of joining up the different parts of the care system. The hon. Gentleman needs to be very careful about putting the blame on that individual.\n\nThe hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) said that he had not yet made up his mind about how he was going to vote at the end of the debate. He now has precisely two minutes in which to do so, so I hope that he can make the decision fairly soon. It is right that his local council will set its priorities. I am afraid that political decisions are made about priorities--that is what we are all here to do and that is what will happen.\n\nThe hon. Member for Guildford (Sue Doughty) said that we were in crisis, but then recognised that lots of improvements were being made because of the \"cash for change\" money. I do not know whether she thinks that we are in crisis or not. She seemed very confused about\n\nthat, but I am pleased that she has welcomed the improvements in her area that have resulted from the Government's action.\n\nIt is this Labour Government who have the courage to invest in better services and to challenge all our partners in local government, the national health service and the independent sector to work together in new ways to deliver for the people whom we represent. The Liberal Democrats said in their manifesto for last year's general election:\n\n\"Three simple words. Freedom, justice, honesty. These sum up what the Liberal Democrats stand for.\"\n\nWe have certainly seen tonight just what they stand for. Three simple words sum them up: cynicism, confusion and opportunism. I ask the House to reject the motion.\n\nQuestion put, That the original words stand part of the Question:--\n\nThe House divided: Ayes 60, Noes 314.\n\nDivision No. 135\n\nAYES\n\nAllan, Richard\n\nBaker, Norman\n\nBarrett, John\n\nBeggs, Roy\n\nBeith, Rt Hon A J\n\nBrake, Tom\n\nBreed, Colin\n\nBruce, Malcolm\n\nBurnett, John\n\nBurstow, Paul\n\nCable, Dr Vincent\n\nCalton, Mrs Patsy\n\nCampbell, Gregory (E Lond'y)\n\nCampbell, Rt Hon Menzies\n\n(NE Fife)\n\nCarmichael, Alistair\n\nChidgey, David\n\nCotter, Brian\n\nDavey, Edward (Kingston)\n\nDodds, Nigel\n\nDoughty, Sue\n\nEwing, Annabelle\n\nFoster, Don (Bath)\n\nGeorge, Andrew (St Ives)\n\nGidley, Sandra\n\nGreen, Matthew (Ludlow)\n\nHancock, Mike\n\nHarris, Dr Evan (Oxford W)\n\nHarvey, Nick\n\nHeath, David\n\nHolmes, Paul\n\nKeetch, Paul\n\nKirkwood, Archy\n\nLamb, Norman\n\nLaws, David\n\nLlwyd, Elfyn\n\nMarsden, Paul (Shrewsbury)\n\nMoore, Michael\n\nOaten, Mark\n\nÖpik, Lembit\n\nPugh, Dr John\n\nReid, Alan (Argyll & Bute)\n\nRendel, David\n\nRobertson, Angus (Moray)\n\nRobinson, Mrs Iris (Strangford)\n\nRobinson, Peter (Belfast E)\n\nRussell, Bob (Colchester)\n\nSanders, Adrian\n\nSmith, Sir Robert (W Ab'd'ns)\n\nSmyth, Rev Martin (Belfast S)\n\nStunell, Andrew\n\nTaylor, Matthew (Truro)\n\nTaylor, Dr Richard (Wyre F)\n\nThomas, Simon (Ceredigion)\n\nTonge, Dr Jenny\n\nTyler, Paul\n\nWebb, Steve\n\nWilliams, Hywel (Caernarfon)\n\nWilliams, Roger (Brecon)\n\nWillis, Phil\n\nYounger-Ross, Richard\n\nTellers for the Ayes:\n\nJohn Thurso and\n\nMrs. Annette L.

This is the primary group where ignorance of the rules is high and the take-up low. However, the HMRC campaign threatens to exclude people who might qualify, at the same as misleading others about which year’s income is important for WTC.\n\nHow to qualify for working tax credit\n\nYou can qualify for WTC:\n\nIf you are not responsible for a child but:\n\n\tare aged at least 25 and work at least 30 hours per week; or\n\tare aged at least 16, work at least 16 hours per week and have a disability which puts you at a disadvantage in getting a job and receive (or have recently received) certain disability benefits; or\n\tare aged at least 50  and are returning to work for at least 16 hours per week after having previously been in receipt of certain welfare benefits.\n\n\nIf you are responsible for at least one child and:\n\n\tare aged at least 16; and\n\tyou or your partner work at least 16 hours per week\n\n\nMeeting one of those qualifying rules may then get you a payment if your income is not too high and you meet other tests\n\n\nHMRC’s take-up campaign misleads \n\nSo why does HMRC’s take-up campaign mislead many people who might be entitled to WTC into thinking that they are not?\n\nOn Directgov, HMRC say:\n\n\nYou could be entitled to claim if you:\n\n\tare aged 25 or over\n\twork at least 30 hours a week\n\tearn up to £13,190 if you’re single, or £17,965 with a partner\n\n\nIf you are a parent, have a disability, or are 50 or over and returning to work, you may still qualify, even if your circumstances are different.\n\n. . . .\n \n\"I work full time and my wife has a part-time job. Together our total income, including our salaries, comes to around £13,000 so we weren’t sure if we could claim any sort of tax credit.\n\n\"But I looked into it and it was a lovely surprise to find out that e were entitled to nearly £2,000 a year Working Tax Credit. That’s not something to turn your nose up at. We phoned the helpline and it was so easy to get the ball rolling and start the claim. We are so glad of the extra support, it really helps from month to month.\n\n\"We’ve told our friends all about it and they’re claiming too now – the more the merrier, we say!\"\nBill, 53, and Kathy, 51, Gateshead\n\n\nThese extracts fail to explain that WTC can be based either upon your income for the last tax year (to 5 April 2009) or the current tax year, whichever is the lower (unless, exceptionally your income rises by over £25,000 year on year).\n\nSo if Bill and Kathy had a joint income of £13,000 last year and a joint income of £18,000 this current tax year, they would still have been entitled to WTC. But how many Bills and Kathys would have realised that fact from reading the extract above?\n\nSid who is 26 and single was on Jobseekers Allowance all last tax year. Since April he has been in a job earning £15,000. He too is misled and doesn’t apply.\n\nWhy other people might be put off too\n\nA sizeable population who fail to claim WTC are dismissed with the words: \n\n\n“If you are a parent, have a disability, or are 50 or over and returning to work, you may still qualify, even if your circumstances are different.”\n\n\nNow what does that mean? What encouragement is there in that statement to find out?\n\nIf you were 20 years old would you imagine that you could be entitled, because the only HMRC reference to age is to 25? As we have shown, you can be entitled at these younger ages.\n\nIf your income is £18,000 in both years might you qualify (because HMRC’s only reference to income is £13,190 and £17,965)? Yes you can, if you meet the disability tests as that raises the income threshold.\n\nIf you are 50 or over the benefits position is critical but the required working hours are only 16. Would you have guessed?\n\nIt only takes a few more words to guide people properly. \n\nJust not good enough\n\nThe campaign logo is a thumbs-up sign. Our conclusion is that this type of campaign is just not good enough and will entrench an incorrect understanding of the qualifying rules for WTC. This misleading “simplification” is something which we pointed out to HMRC three years ago when they promised not to do it again. It therefore gets the thumbs-down from us.\n\nWe hope HMRC will change this campaign and soon. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tContact Name: John Andrews (0844 579 6700 Fax 0844 579 6701)\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \tSearch the site | Sitemap | Print Page\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\tCopyright © 2003 - 2009 LITRG | Legal | Design and technology by Reading Room\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n",
