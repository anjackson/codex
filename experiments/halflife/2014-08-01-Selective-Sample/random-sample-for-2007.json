One member of the leading opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), has been shot dead and others have suffered injuries. I send my deepest condolences to the family and friends of those killed and injured in this terrible assault.\n\n\n\n'The UK holds Robert Mugabe and his Zimbabwe Government responsible for the safety of all those detained, urges the police to allow them access to legal advice, to provide them with medical care and to arrange for their immediate release.\n\n\n\n'This latest incident shows the urgency of changes in policy as the economy and institutions of Zimbabwe crumble.

Background \n \nRabi (post rainy season) sorghum is grown over 6 m ha in India primarily for food and \nfodder, but it has low productivity. This means that farmers are growing inferior cultivars \nfor which inputs are also lower than in the best genetic material was grown.  The choice of \nvarieties for farmers is limited to a few local cultivars because released varieties do not \nmeet farmers’ criteria. \n \nParticipatory varietal selection (PVS) provides an opportunity for farmers to select one or \nmore varieties from a basket of recently developed genotypes from plant breeding \nprograms.  Witcombe et al. (1996) reported that if a suitable choice of cultivar exists, PVS \nis a more rapid and cost effective way of identifying farmer-preferred cultivars than \nconventional, transfer-of-technology and extension methods. \n \nIn India, Maurya et al. (1988) tested advanced lines of rice with villagers in Uttar Pradesh \nand successfully identified superior material that was preferred by farmers. Also in India, \nJoshi and Witcombe (1996) identified farmer-acceptable cultivars of rice and chickpea \nfrom a range of released and non-released cultivars tested in farmer-managed participatory \n \nDFID Final Technical Report  Page 1 of 64 trials. Farmer-acceptable cultivars were found among released varieties but not among \nthose recommended for the area. Participatory varietal selection by the DFID-funded \nKRIBHCO project in Western India has demonstrated that farmers adopt better cultivars \nonce a basket of choice is offered to them, e.g. a large-scale adoption of other state variety \nKalinga III of rice in the rain fed areas of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.  \n \nThe participatory approach to varietal selection is considered valuable when formal \nbreeding and seed-supply systems have been unable to fulfill the needs of users. This often \noccurs where the agro-ecological or socio-economic environment differs significantly from \nthose anticipated and tested for in the formal system of variety testing.  In rabi sorghum, \nseveral factors mean that PVS could be a useful approach: low adoption of improved \ncultivars, variable growing conditions and multiple production constraints in farmers’ fields \nthat are difficult to simulate on the research station, and local preferences for grain quality \n(Rana et al. 1998). \n \nFarmers desire the following traits incorporated in rabi cultivars: High yield and quality of \nboth grain and fodder, bold and lustrous grains, and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses \nequal to M35-1(Rana et al. 2000). Under these constraints, a PVS approach involving \nfarmers for selection and genetic enhancement would be worthwhile. Participatory \nmethods, suitably modified from those used in KRIBHCO west, were tested for rabi \nsorghum varietal selection in three states i.e. Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka.  \nIn the first phase, available elite varieties and advanced generation genotypes were \nprovided to farmers for selection and adoption under a wide spectrum of socio-economic \nenvironments.  This laid the foundation for the exploitation of the most adopted cultivars as \nparents in participatory plant breeding. \n \n \n2. Project purpose: \n \n• Selection of suitable varieties by farmers from improved cultivars tested in farmer-\nmanaged trials \n• Demonstration of farmer participatory research (FPR) methods those are effective \nin increasing cultivar diversity and replacement rate and thereby production. \n• Increased farmer(both men and women) participation \n• Promotion of superior local varietal selections, natural management practices, and \nlow cost production technology identified in farmer managed trials. \n• Production of rabi sorghum on impoverished soils in semi-arid conditions increased \nby selection and genetic enhancement of cultivars. \n• Physiology of the drought resistance in rabi sorghum understood, plant genes \ncoding for resistance transferred into adapted genetic background and tolerant \nstrains promoted in the target area. \n• Collection of local landrace biodiversity for conservation and utilization in breeding \nprogrammes. \n \n \n \n \nDFID Final Technical Report  Page 2 of 64 2.1. Methods: \n \nTwo methods for popularization of new varieties (extension) were compared.  \n \n1. Farmer Managed Participatory Research (FAMPAR) trials with new varieties.  \n2. A control that is limited to public sector extension activity. \n \nThe sources for the new material were the national and state released cultivars.  \nAdvanced generation lines/pre-released varieties from ICRISAT and NRCS, and co-\noperating breeders were also the source of new materials. \n \nA simple method of Farmer Participatory Research (FPR) was used in which Farmer \nManaged Participatory Research (FAMPAR) trials were conducted.  In FAMPAR trials, \nfarmers grew new varieties alongside their local variety and evaluated for cultivar traits. A \nsingle new cultivar was randomly given to a participating farmer for FAMPAR trial.  There \nwere at least 3 replications in a village with three farmers for every variety. The total \nnumber of farmers involved measured in hundreds, but a reasonably large sample (20) per \nvillage were used for detailed surveys and monitoring adoption of varieties. \n \nBesides the technical programme, the schedules were prepared and circulated for the \ncollection of data from farmers under the DFID project on the farmer’s participatory \nvarietal selection in rabi sorghum. Schedules for  village statistics(Schedule-I), basic \ninformation of farm families (Schedule II), bench mark survey of farm families (Schedule \nIII), proforma for farm family plan (Schedule IV) were given to NGOs for collection of \ndata( Annexure-I). All the information was recorded by respective NGOs and they are \nmaintained in the research stations. \n \n2.2. Trial design \n \nEach of the six NGOs selected three villages, each with a minimum of six participating \nfarmers. The number of varieties tested by each NGO ranged from 6 to 15.  The NGOs in \nconsultation with farmers decided to give each farmer 2 kg seed of each entry for the \nFarmer Managed Participatory Research (FAMPAR) Adaptive Varietal trials and 1 kg seed \nof each entry for FAMPAR Initial Varietal trials.  However, involving more farmers by \nproviding each of them with less seed was considered a more appropriate design.  Each \ngenotype was tested by three farmers to represent three replications.  A trial consisted of \ngrowing the new cultivar alongside the local cultivar in a similar-sized plot without any \nplant protection and under farmer management.  Observations on grain yield, dry fodder \nyield, grain appearance, and farmer-preferred traits (for male and female farmers) were \nrecorded. Farm walks, focus-group discussions, and house-level questionnaires were \nemployed. \n \nBased on the discussions in the yearly meetings, the technical programmes for the Farmer \nManaged Participatory Research (FAMPAR) Adaptive and Initial Varietal trials from Rabi \n1999-2000 to 2001-2002 are detailed in Tables 1 to 7.  \n \n \nDFID Final Technical Report  Page 3 of 64  \n  2.3.

Research Activities \n \nThe project was proposed through the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). \nThe implementing agency is National Research Centre for Sorghum, Rajendranagar, \nHyderabad and its collaborators. The participating agency from the UK is the Centre for \nArid Zone Studies, University of Wales. Bangor , which has an international reputation in \nparticipatory plant breeding research.  \n \nThe research activities were carried out in three states of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and \nKarnataka where rabi sorghum is grown on a sizable area of 5.42 m ha out of a total area of \n5.6 m ha. Therefore, project locations were identified in each of these states, which are as \nfollows: \n \nAndhra Pradesh: Medak (NRCS and ICRISAT) \nMaharashtra : Solapur, Dhule(Rahuri centre), and Parbhani \nKarnataka: Bijapur and Dharwad \n \n  The soil types for different NGO’s were finalized as below: \n \nBijapur/Solapur  : Shallow, Medium, Deep and Irrigated \nDharwad   : Medium, Deep and Irrigated \nParbhani   : Medium, Deep and Irrigated \nAP (Hyderabad)  : All types of soil except irrigated  \n \n \nAll these sites have centres of the All India Coordinated Sorghum Improvement Project of \nICAR located in state agricultural universities (SAUs). Six non-governmental organizations \n(NGOs), six centers of the All India Co-ordinanted Sorghum Improvement Project \n(AICSIP) located SAUs, the National Research Centre for Sorghum (NRCS), and the \nInternational Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) collaborated \nin the research.

Joint monitoring by researchers \nand farmers was done at a minimum of three crop stages, and data were collected on the \nperformance of the entries. Before the rabi sowing, the NGOs selected the participating \nfarmers by organizing group discussions that included both farmers and officials. \n \n4. Outputs:  \n \nAs per the technical prgoramme decided every year, FAMPAR trials were conducted \nby all the centers with the help of NGO’s. The number of trials successfully conducted \nby various centers against the allotted is detailed in the Annexure -II. Also highlights \nof research progress year-wise and centre-wise are presented in Annexure-III. The \nimproved varieties tested in farmer fields every year were pooled and mean yields are \ntabulated in Tables 8 to 15. \n \nFirst year: Rabi 1999-2000 \n \nFARMPAR Adaptive Varietal Trial: Four varieties and one hybrid were tested in this \n-1 -1\ntrial.

Proceedings of Planning Workshop held at Centre for Arid Zone Studies, \nUniversity of Wales, United Kingdom from 22 to 30 August 1999 \n \nA project planning workshop was organized at Centre for Arid Zone Studies (CAZS), \nUniversity of Wales, Bangor, U.K. from 22 to 30 August, 1999 for finalizing the details \nof activities and approaches of participatory varietal selection and to enable Indian \nScientists to efficiently implement the Indo-British Collaborative Project on \n“Participatory Varietal Selection in Rabi Sorghum” funded by DFID Plant Sciences \nResearch Programme.  This project has been implemented at seven centres under the \nleadership of Dr.B.S.Rana, Director, NRC for Sorghum, Hyderabad for a period of \nthree years from 1 July 1999. The scientific / technical deliberations of the workshop \nare mentioned in detail in Annexure-X \n \n4.8. Significant contributions of the project \n \n• Available elite varieties (SPV -1359, SPV-1380, SPV-1411, SPV-1155, RSLG-\n262) and advanced generation genotypes (SPV1413, SPV-1462, SPV-1463, \nSPV-1452, SPV-1457, SPV-1490, SPV-1492, SPV-1493, SPV,1502, SPV-\n1503, SPV-1550, SPV-1555, SPV-1556, SPV-1494, CRS-1,CRS-2, BRJ-\n356,GRC-15,RSV-143, RSV-170, ,JP1-1-5, GRC-17-1,M35-1),were provided \nto the farmers for selection and adoption under a wide spectrum of socio-\neconomic environments. \n• The project has helped in identification of traits preferred by farmers (Roti \nquality characters and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses) could be \nincorporated in further breeding programmes. \n• It has helped demonstrations of the genetic material developed in the farmer’s \nfield on a large-scale and to identify the cultivars (SPV -1359, SPV-1380, SPV-\n1411, SPV-1155, RSLG-262) preferred by farmers. \n• The data generated in the project have been used as additional information for \nthe release of the three cultivars preferred by the farmers namely, SPV-1359 as \nCSV-216R(Phule Yashoda) at the national level, and RSLG-262 as Mauli for \nthe shallow soil areas and SPV-1411 as Parbhani Moti for medium to deep soils \nand under rain fed conditions of Maharashtra state \n• It has helped farmer to farmer spread of the farmer-preferred cultivars (SPV -\n1359, SPV-1380, SPV-1411, SPV-1155, and RSLG-262) not only in the project \narea but also in the neighboring states where the sorghum is being cultivated; \nfurther it has motivated the seed producing agencies. \n• The project has led to the identification and prioritization of the problems \nassociated with the acceptance/adoption of the improved cultivars by farmers, \nthus leading to research in the demand-driven areas of rabi sorghum-quality \nparameters. \n• The local germplasm that was collected is now being used for assessment of the \nvarious parameters and in the breeding programmes. \n• The socio-economic-psychological, technological factors of the farmers \nassociated in the adoption of the improved cultivars are identified and efforts \nare now being made to incorporate such factors in the further studies. \n \nDFID Final Technical Report  Page 30 of 64 5. Contribution of the outputs: \n \n• The project has laid the foundation for demonstrating the farmer’s \nparticipatory research methods that are effective in increasing both the \ncultivars diversity and replacement rates. \n• The farmers have evaluated the different entries/population/selections in the \nfarmer-managed trials, which led to identification of the farmer’s preferred \ncultivars. \n• The farmers preferred cultivars have spread not only in the project area, but \nalso to the neighboring villages/districts where the rabi sorghum is being \ncultivated. \n• The project has helped in the identification of three rabi genotypes (SPV-\n1359 as CSV-216R, RSLG-262 as Mauli and SPV-1411 as Parbhani Moti \nthat have been preferred by the farmers, for their release under the national \nand state levels. \n• The project has motivated the seed producing agencies for the production \nand distribution of the farmer’s preferred cultivars tested under the farmers \nmanaged trials in the project. \n• The project has contributed towards the collection of the local land races for \nconservation and utilization in the breeding programme. \n• The incorporation of the farmers preferred traits like grain and fodder \nquality, flour recovery, threshability, roti quality, etc. in the future breeding \nprogramme is essential. \n• The project has led to the identification of the various socio-psychological, \ntechnological factors associated in the adoption and diffusion of the farmers \npreferred cultivars. \n \n6. Conclusions \n \nParticipatory varietal selection appears to be an effective approach to supplement plant \nbreeding efforts in marginal areas, where progress with varietal adoption has been slow. \nThe farmers evaluated the different entries/population/selections in the farmer-managed \ntrials, which led to identification of the farmer’s preferred cultivars. The farmers \npreferred cultivars have spread not only in the project area, but also to the neighboring \nvillages/districts where the rabi sorghum is being cultivated. The incorporation of the \nfarmers preferred traits like grain and fodder quality, flour recovery, threshability, roti \nquality, etc. in the future breeding programme is essential. \n \nIn contrast to the general belief that M35-1 is a popularly grown variety, access to \nNGOs and farmers revealed that various landraces are still grown in rabi sorghum \ngrowing areas in addition to M35-1. Improved varieties such as SPV -1359, SPV-1380, \nSPV-1411, SPV-1155 and RSLG-262 from the AICSIP advanced varietal trials, and \nSPV-655 performed excellently. The first three have already been released..  Thus, the \nvarietal testing at the research station is usually, but not always, satisfactory to \ndetermine adaptability under realistic farmer management.   Further PVS success will \ndepend on newly evolved varieties, based on the farmers’ perceptions learnt in these \nstudies. \n \n \nDFID Final Technical Report  Page 31 of 64 7.

A total of 213 trials (168 trials \nof AVT + 45 TRIALS OF IVT) have been conducted. The trials were laid out as per the \nplan along with locals. The representative plots of varieties under Adaptive trials like \nSPV-1380, CSV-216R, SPV-1155, RSLG-262, SPV-655, and SPV-1411 and of Initial \nvarietal trials like CRS-2, SPV-1502, SPV-1492, and RSV-170 were observed and the \nvarieties appeared to be better than the respective locals.  The response of the farmers \nwas good. \n \nAt Akkalkot, the FPVS trials were conducted in three villages namely Sultanpur, Chungi \nand Kini through NGO, Maharshi Vivekanand Samaj Kalyan Sanstha, Akkalkot. A total \nof 174 trials (150 trials of AVT +24 trials of IVT) were conducted. The trials were laid \nout as per the plan along with locals. The respresentive plots of varieties of Adaptive \nVarietal Trials namely CSV-216R, SPV-1380, SPV-1155, RSLG-262 and SPV-1411 and \nof Initial Varietal Trial namely SPV-1502, SPV-1457, SPV-1463 and SPV-1492 were \nseen. The crop condition was good and farmers responded to the programme favorably. \n \n \nDFID Final Technical Report  Page 60 of 64 In Bijapur center, the FPVS trials were conducted in three villages namely \nHonaganahalli, Savanhalli and Thonsyal.  A total of 180 trials were conducted. The trials \nwere laid out as per the plan along with locals and the varieties appeared to be better than \nthe respective locals. Among the varieties the, SPV-1380, CSV-216 and SPV-1155 were \nfound promising for grain quality and non-lodging.  SPV-1155 was early to flower. BRJ-\n356, RSLG-262 performed well under shallow soils.  The problem of exertion in SPV-\n1491 (Thonsyal village) was slightly high.  In RSV-256, SPV-1502, RSV-257 the \ngermination percentage was poor.  The overall crop condition in the farmers filed was \ngood, and farmers responded to the programme favorably.  \n \nIn Dharwad center following results were obtained: \n \nEvaluation of local land races (LGY): Sixteen genotypes including M35-1 were \nevaluated.  Due to sudden withdrawal or rabi rains soon after sowing, plant stand in \ngeneral was low in all the entries.  However, among the entries tested, Tandur local \nrewarded highest grain yield of 2407 kg/ha followed by Gidda Maldandi (2315 kg/ha), \nwhereas, M35-1 rewarded grain yield of 1509 kg/ha. \n \n Evaluation of elite varieties / hybrids in farmer’s field:Twelve varieties including CSH-\n15R were tested in 207 farmer’s field comprising of 3 villages, viz., Somapur (74), \nMarewad (71) and Arahatti (62).  Based on the overall performance the varieties SPV-\n1155, SPV-1359 and SPV-1380 were found to perform better than local check M35-1 and \nthese three varieties were accepted by farmers based on their grain and fodder quality.   \n \n \n \nDFID Final Technical Report  Page 61 of 64  \n \nAnnexure-X \n \nProceedings of Planning Workshop held at Centre for Arid Zone Studies, \nnd th\nUniversity of Wales, United Kingdom from 22 to 30 August 1999 \n \nA project planning workshop was organized at Centre for Arid Zone Studies (CAZS), \nnd th\nUniversity of Wales, Bangor, U.K. from 22 to 30 August, 1999 for finalizing the \ndetails of activities and approaches of participatory varietal selection and to enable \nIndian Scientists to efficiently implement the Indo-British Collaborative Project on \n“Participatory Varietal Selection in rabi sorghum” funded by; the DFID Plant Sciences \nResearch Programme.  This project has been implemented at seven centres under the \nleadership of Dr.B.S.Rana, Director, NRC for Sorghum, Hyderabad for a period of three \nyears from July 1, 1999. The scientific / technical deliberations of the workshop are as \nfollows. \n \nOn 23-8-1999 \n \nVisit to typical English Farm: On the way, visit to a typical English Newspring Farm \nin Cambridgeshire was arranged at 08.30 hrs. The cropping pattern is on an average 75-\n80 acres of Oilseeds rape and 254-259 acres of winter wheat.  They explained in detail \non the seed procurement, soil husbandry, input required for the crops and output by way \nof yield and gross margin.  The crops are insured for fire and hailstorm. The farmer’s \nincome is taxable in U.K.  Besides, the farmers in U.K. are also affected by fluctuation \nin price, untimely rains, drought etc. \n \nVisit to Henry Doubleday Research Association, Organic Gardens, Coventry: On \nthe way, we visited HRDA, Ryton organic Gardens from 1400 to 1600 hrs and Dr. \nFelicity Childs explained in detail about the activities of HRDA in Scientific research \nextension and training for developing countries.  It is the largest organic organization in \nEurope, researching, providing information on and promoting organic gardening, \nfarming and food. \n  \nThe conservation of genetic resources is an important part of the Association’s work; \nhundreds of vegetable varieties are preserved for prosperity in the Heritage Seed \nLibrary, based at Ryton Orgainc Gardens. The Ryton demonstration gardens, are open \nto the public, and attract tens of thousands of visitors annually.  These have been so \nsuccessful that HRDA hs created new display gardens at Yalding, near Maidstone in \nKent.  HRDA also carries out scientific research in areas such as field vegetable \nproduction, pest, disease and weed control, recycling organic waste and soil nutrient \ndynamics. \n \n \n \n \n \nDFID Final Technical Report  Page 62 of 64 ON 24-8-1999 \n \nThe actual AICSIP/CAZS planning workshop for Participatory Varietal Selection in \nRabi Sorghum started at 1000 hrs with welcome by Dr.J.R.Witcombe and introduction \nof participants.  Presentations were made by AICSIP and collaborators.  Dr. \nB.S.Dhillon, ADG (FFC), ICAR gave a brief account on the genesis of the project and \nrole played by ICAR. Later, Dr.B.S.Rana, Director, NRCS and National Leader of the \nproject explained in detail about the Farmers Participatory Varietal Selection for \nimproving Rabi Sorghum productivity in India.  Dr.S.L.Kaul, Co-Principal Investigator \nexplained technical aspects followed to design the participatory varietal selection in \nrabi sorghum.  Later, the Collaborators explained their experiences in conducting the \nParticipatory Varietal Selection programme voluntarily during Rabi 1998 at their \ncentres.  The presentations were preceded by a lecture on Participatory Varietal \nSelection by Dr. J.R.Witcombe.  He explained as to how farmers participatory \napproaches for identification or breeding of improved crop cultivars can be usefully \ncategorized into Participatory Varietal Selection (PVS) and participatory plant breeding.  \nPVS is a more rapid and cost effective way of identifying farmer preferred cultivars if a \nsuitable choice of cultivars exists.  If this is difficult to achieve, then the more resource-\nconsuming PPB is required.   The long-term effect of PVS is to increase biodiversity, \nidentifying adapted varieties speedy diffusion through in situ seed multiplication \nsystem.  PPB has a greater effect on increasing biodiversity although its impact may be \nlimited to smaller areas.  PVS is a modification of the multilocational trials system \nthrough farmer management to: \n \n• Allocate more resources for  testing a greater number of elite lines \n• Allow many traits to be evaluated by farmer himself \n• Allow varieties to be tested under realistic management of farmer \n• Allow varieties to be tested in a wide range of agronomic niches \n• Promote the speed with which new varieties are adopted \n \nFrom 25-8-1999 to 27-8-1999 \n \nThere were three lectures by Dr.B.S.Virk, Dr.D.Harris and Dr.J.R.Witcombe, \nrespectively in the forenoon session. \n \nDr. Virk gave a detailed account of the success of PVS in high potential production \nsystem in India by taking an example of PVS system in Lunawada district in Gujarat.  \nPVS has been used threre with great success in marginal agricultural environments.  It \nshowed the large difference between favorable environments of the multilocational \ntrials of the system and the actual conditions of the farmers. \n \nDr.Harris described the beneficial effects of on farm seed priming both for rain fed and \nrabi crops grown in pocket area of KRIBHCO Indo-British Project in India.  The \nparticipatory approach used by KRIBHCO project has been highly successful in \nempowering farmers to test, develop and adapt seed priming and to appreciate its \n \nDFID Final Technical Report  Page 63 of 64 effects.  The results of over a thousand on farm trials using paired plots for maize, rice, \nchickpea and wheat showed that seed priming is a good insurance to farmers. \n \nDr.Witcombe, highlighted the aspects related to choice of parents, number of crosses \nand population size for participatory and classical plant breeding. Published theory on \nthe optimum number of crosses in a plant breeding programme usually assumes that the \nvalue of all crosses is equal and hence over-estimates the number of crosses required in \na breeding programme.  When the optimum size of a population in a favorable cross is \nconsidered theory predicts that huge populations are required.  If linkage between traits \nis also considered this population size is even larger.  Hence, in a inbreeding crop, one \npossible strategy is to select a small number of crosses that are considered favorable and \nproduce large populations from them to increase the probability of recovering superior \ngenotypes. This strategy is ideally suited to the particular constraints and advantages of \nparticipatory plant breeding (PPB).  Such an approach although not essential in classical \nbreeding (CB) may still be advantageous.  When a breeding progamme is based on few \ncrosses, the choice of parents is critical and farmer participatory methods are highly \neffective in narrowing the choice.  In the participatory plant breeding of self pollinated \ncrops using a low-cross-number approach modified bulk population breeding methods \nand recurrent selection are desirable strategies. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDFID Final Technical Report  Page 64 of 64 \n",

The main presentations focused on the safety of care, and participants heard about WHO's World Alliance for Patient Safety and the Global Patient Safety Challenge: Clean Care is Safer Care, which is a core element of the Alliance.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWHO Assistant Director-General Dr Timothy Evans opened the presentations on the World Alliance by thanking the organisers for once again allowing a focus on patient safety issues as in the 2004 event.  \nSir Liam Donaldson, who is Chair of the Alliance outlined the background and launch of the World Alliance for Patient Safety and described its six programmes, introducing the Global Patient Safety Challenge as a core programme for 2005-2006. This programme focuses on addressing health care-associated infection, with the theme \"Clean Care is Safer Care\".\nLeading the Global Patient Safety Challenge, Professor Pittet, Director of the Infection Control Programme, University of Geneva Hospitals (Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genève) presented the main objectives and components of the Global Challenge and emphasized the importance of improving hand hygiene when it comes to addressing health care-associated infection.

Meath (Iwerddon), a chylch pydew yn y blaendir.\nMae bedd cyntedd adluniedig Newgrange yn un o blith nifer o feddau enfawr yn Nyffryn Boyne.[Llun ? Steve Burrow].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5,500 o flynyddoedd yn ?l lledaenodd diwylliant cyffredin ar hyd a lled arfordir gorllewin Ewrop gan gydgysylltu Llydaw, Cernyw, Cymru, de'r Alban ac Iwerddon.\n\n\nHeddiw, mae'r dystiolaeth am y diwylliant hwn wedi goroesi ar ffurf beddau cyntedd - tomenni claddu crwn ac ynddynt dramwyfeydd wedi'u leinio ? cherrig sy'n arwain i siambrau canolog.\n\n\nAdeiladwyd y beddau hyn gan gymunedau amaethyddol cynnar i gadw gweddillion amlosgedig y meirw, ac fe'u defnyddid am genedlaethau. Mae'n rhaid eu bod yn dirnodau pwysig a gysylltai'r byw ?'u cyndadau.\n\n\nYng Nghymru, Ynys M?n yw'r lle gorau i weld beddau cyntedd ac mae Barclodiad y Gawres a Bryn Celli Ddu, dwy enghraifft bwysig, mewn cyflwr mor dda fel bod modd caniat?u mynediad i'r cyhoedd.\n\n\nPan adeiladwyd Barclodiad y Gawres cr?wyd un brif siambr ac, o boptu iddi, dair siambr ystlys y c?i'r meirw eu gosod ynddynt. Yng nghanol y brif siambr roedd aelwyd a byddai'r t?n a gyneuid yma yn goleuo'r bedd yn ystod defodau.\n\n\nEr mawr syndod i'r archaeolegwyr a fu'n cloddio'r bedd, cafwyd hyd i 'gymysgedd anghynnes' o esgyrn ymlusgiaid, pysgod ac amffibiaid ar safle'r aelwyd hon. Er na chawn ni fyth wybod y rheswm am y fath gymysgedd, ceir cipolwg pwysig ar un agwedd ar ddiwylliant adeiladwyr Barclodiad y Gawres drwy astudio'r celfwaith anghyffredin sydd wedi'i naddu ar y meini sy'n leinio'r dramwyfa a'r siambr. Mae'r cynlluniau hyn yn cynnwys troellau a phatrymau igam-ogam dolennog anghyffredin.\n\n\nO ystyried y safle hwn yn unig, gellid diystyru'r patrymau a'u priodoli i ffansi'r adeladwyr, ond ceir cerfiadau o'r math yma mewn beddau cyntedd mor bell i ffwrdd ag Iwerddon a Llydaw.\n\n\nMae rhai wedi awgrymu bod y cerfiadau, o bosibl, yn cynrychioli'r patrymau chwyrl?ol a gysylltir ? pherlewygon.\n\n\nCafwyd hyd i faen patrymog tebyg ym Mryn Celli Ddu (Ynys M?n). Fodd bynnag, yn yr achos hwn cafwyd hyd i'r maen yn gorwedd ar ei wyneb mewn twll o dan siambr y bedd, lle mae'n rhaid y cafodd ei gladdu cyn y dechreuwyd codi'r bedd. A gafodd ei gladdu er mwyn sancteiddio'r safle, neu a gladdwyd y maen er mwyn ei guddio? - dyma ddirgelwch arall sydd heb ei ddatrys.\n\n\nNid beddau cyntedd M?n yw'r unig rai yng Nghymru. Ceir enghreifftiau eraill yng Ngwynedd a Sir Benfro, er nad yw'r rhain mewn cyflwr mor dda.\n\n\nAm y beddau cyntedd mwyaf a mwyaf cymhleth, y mae'n rhaid teithio i Iwerddon. Yma, dengys safleoedd megis Newgrange a Knowth pa mor uchelgeisiol y gallai cynlluniau adeiladwyr y beddau fod.\n\n\nYn Knowth, gerllaw'r bedd canolog, ceir mynwent ac ynddi o leiaf 18 o enghreifftiau llai, ac yn Newgrange aliniwyd y dramwyfa yn union ar linell codiad yr haul ganol gaeaf (Alban Arthur) gan y peirianwyr medrus a'i cododd.\n\n\nYn y mannau hynny lle ceir beddau cyntedd, maent i gyd ychydig yn wahanol o ran eu cynllun. Eto i gyd, maent i gyd yn ddigon tebyg i'w gilydd i ddangos bod M?r Iwerddon yn dramwyfa brysur ar ddiwedd Oes y Cerrig, gyda chymunedau o Lydaw hyd yr Alban yn rhannu syniadau a dulliau o barchu'r meirw.\n\n\n\n\nDarllen Cefndir\n\n\nThe Tomb Builders: In Wales 4000-3000BC gan Steve Burrow.

With dyslexia affecting up to 10% of the population*, \n        it is vital that teachers at schools and colleges understand this specific \n        learning difficulty, in order to provide appropriate support to dyslexic \n        students and assist them in achieving their potential. \n\n      Despite an increased awareness of dyslexia over recent years, few people \n        have a real understanding of what it is like to live with dyslexia. To \n        tackle this problem, experts in dyslexia education have designed a new \n        pack of resources – DyslexSim – to help boost understanding \n        of dyslexia in education and the workplace. \n\n      The pack contains innovative computer software that simulates the visual \n        perceptual difficulties often associated with dyslexia, as well as a range \n        of practical hands-on activities to help boost understanding of different \n        aspects of the specific learning difficulty.\n\n      “Making learning materials accessible to all learners is extremely \n        important, but it can be difficult where there is a poor understanding \n        of what dyslexia is”, says Dr Nigel Beacham, co-author of DyslexSim. \n        “DyslexSim provides a powerful tool to help explain dyslexia easily, \n        by showing visual examples of what someone with dyslexia may experience”, \n        he continues.\n\n      The selection of activities provided are easy to implement and can either \n        be used as stand alone materials or combined to suit individual circumstances. \n        Additional case study information offers valuable information about how \n        to identify and understand dyslexia, explain it to others, and deal with \n        individuals with dyslexia.\n\n      “DyslexSim provides a convincing demonstration of the visual processing \n        difficulties that many dyslexic, and some non-dyslexic, people experience,” \n        says Ellen Morgan, Dyslexia Support Co-ordinator at City University and \n        Chair of the Association of Dyslexia Specialists in Higher Education. \n        “DyslexSim is a very useful tool for staff development sessions, \n        particularly for convincing the remaining sceptics!,” she concludes.\n\n      Dr David Pollak, Principal Lecturer in Learning Support at De Montfort \n        University, adds:\n\n      “DyslexSim is a unique and valuable addition to staff development \n        literature. The generous supply of copyable materials is a particular \n        strength of this kit, on top of the brilliant originality of the simulations.”\n\n      The DyslexSim materials pack can be purchased from Loughborough University, \n        at a special introductory price of £95 plus VAT until September \n        2005.

Jenny Randerson, AM for Cardiff Central will address the rally at the Temple of Peace in the heart of Cardiff’s civic centre.\n      \n\n      \n        “While I understand the need for efficiency Wales can simply not afford 5,000 job losses, it is also counterproductive to run down job centres and other offices in areas of high unemployment.\n“The devolved government should have a stronger say in the Welsh civil service as the civil service has such a major impact on Wales both in terms of its services and employment.\n“The Labour government has led the civil service into chaos. While they are putting big money into making NHS and Local Government pay fairer they are going in the opposite direction in the Civil service. An identical person working in two places doing a very similar job could get two very different salaries.”\nNotes:\nJenny Randerson AM will be addressing the rally between 12 noon and 1.00 pm in the Temple of Peace, Cathays Park, Cardiff\nEnds⁄diwedd  \n \n\n      \n\n      Oes unrhyw beth gennych chi i’w ddweud am y stori hon?

         message: hey babe, no i dont think your selfish, i think a lot of docters are still living in the past regarding ed's, i remember how mine was with me, not that he didnt care, just that his lack of understanding led to tactlessness (in my eyes at least).  i konw our suffering makes us oblivious of other things around us, but if you put it into a physical sense, if you stubbed your toe and your boyfriend tried tickling you, you wouldnt laugh because your painful toe takes the fun away, same thing mentally, you wernt in a good frame of mind to recieve good news.  neither you or your boyfriend are to blame, you just shared opposite emotions.  since you find it hard to eat i thought i might try giving you one of  my tips.  have some pieces of fruit or something you like and can eat without guilt,  try to think of positive things to focus on, then, still focusing on the positive thing just let your hand guide the food to your mouth. i found this hard at first i guess you might think it sounds silly but i find it always works, for instance the other day i remembered when my daughter fish hooked her cousin in the mouth, it made me laugh so much my belly hurt, then inadvertantly i ate a segment of orange. its getting so much easier, because im associating it with poitive feeling instead of negative, i used to reject food because i felt rejected, now i just feel ready to take the step and make better days come!                                                      \n\n          \n\n          \n\n        \n\n      \n\n      \n\n                \n      \n

what you are saying about the not being able to cope and also not to be able to feel positive about things like the apartment, even when you really want to. \nIt's the same with some of life's little drawbacks sometimes.  The other day I spilt some milk in my fridge and just started sobbing (he he just thought of the phrase no good crying over spilt milk - well I did good and proper) and my boyfriend came in and was so worried and asking what had happened.  I know it's hard for them to understand but I find that to just keep communication open and keep explaining can help.  I just explained to mine that it wasn't so much the milk but how I feel my head is sometimes so full to bursting point with ED stuff that I find it hard to cope with other 'normal' things.\nIt will get better - I hope you feel better now.\nMaybe talk with your ED nurse again and see if she can help with your GP at all?\nx x x Hugs x x x\n                                                      \n\n

How do we reevaluate what our focus is, return to Christ and meet others as equals?  And, a question, what hinders the change?\n\n\n\n\n\nI struggle with these ideas in my own church, Baptist background.  I think churches tend to cling to ritual and structure to the loss of the gospel.  If it is based on Christ, there shouldn't have to be racial divisions.  All are equal under God and in the same condition.\n\n\n\n\n\nHonestly, not being from Quaker background, I see a lot of potential in the Quaker meeting to do this.... more than a church that relies heavily on the Sunday morning sermon.  It seems that the meeting has built into it more equality and community of people meeting God together.   More vulnerability and the awareness of our need for each other and God.  At least this is what I see as possibilities.\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tBillSamuel\n\n\n\nJoined: 06 Aug 2002\nPosts: 524\nLocation: Silver Spring, MD, USA\n\t\tPosted:  Tue Aug 23, 2005 5:25 am    Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tIn unprogrammed meetings, there is often a very great emphasis on the form of the worship service, as great or greater than in churches known for being highly liturgical.

I have a couple of reactions to this:\n\n\n\n\n\n1.  The stereotypes are not as true as the holders of the stereotypes think.\n\n\n2.  Is form or substance more important?\n\n\n3.  If we truly believe that there is God in each person, and God does not make distinctions based on such externals as color and ethnic background, wouldn't we be more concerned with living out that faith understanding than with holding rigidly to any form, no matter how useful we have found the form?\n_________________\nBill Samuel, Silver Spring, MD, USA\n\n\nCo-Coordinator, Friends in Christ\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tjames\n\n\n\nJoined: 11 Jun 2004\nPosts: 576\nLocation: Minneapolis\n\t\tPosted:  Wed Aug 24, 2005 8:21 am    Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\t\n\tQuote:\n\tIn unprogrammed meetings, there is often a very great emphasis on the form of the worship service, as great or greater than in churches known for being highly liturgical. As unity on the content of faith has crumbled, Friends often cling particularly tenaciously to the form as a source of unity. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have heard this claim made many times by conservative Friends, in many cases specifically to justify a return to traditional Protestant forms which has occurred in those Friends' meetings or churches. It doesn't hold water. The \"form\" liberal Friends tend to focus on is in fact the practice of silent worship out of which any can speak. The form of this practice is in fact formlessness, the relative absence of ritual aside from sitting together, an open space into which spirit is invited to flow. I would not and do not criticize programmed or semi-programmed worship as an valid variation on Quaker tradition, but in fact either of these are clearly more focused on form than unprogrammed worship. One potential effect of programming is that the worship is shaped by those who assume authority over the meeting/church, rather than by the spirit moving in/through any who attend a particular meeting. To describe such programming as a lesser focus on form is untrue and a distraction from programmed Friends' own renewed focus on form.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegarding the welcoming of minorities to Friends Meetings, of course it is crucial that we genuinely welcome those who come through our doors, including those who might change our practice over time, or immediately by speaking out of the silence. Such change has always occurred. Sometimes, the nature of the change will make a meeting, or the society of Friends at large, less comfortable for long-time attenders. This can be a sad event. On the other hand, if, for instance, Black folks do not attend our meetings because the practice of silent worship feels culturally alien to them, that's OK. It is culturally alien to many of them. For us to pre-emptively change our worship and start raising the rafters with rollicking Gospel tunes like the Baptists in order to attract more Baptists, would just be silly and dishonest. It is not our job to change our religion to attract more Black people, but to  be open and welcoming as we can within our integrity.\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tthanhkim\n\n\n\nJoined: 27 Jul 2005\nPosts: 27\nLocation: U.S.\n\t\tPosted:  Thu Aug 25, 2005 8:17 pm    Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\t\n\tQuote:\n\tAs unity on the content of faith has crumbled, Friends often cling particularly tenaciously to the form as a source of unity. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was wondering if you could go into this...  I think it is an insightful point that I also see as a root for clinging to form among the more mainstream church background.

The traditition is one in which people have come to Meeting seeking, on thier own, the unique experience of religious tolerance, opposition to violence and war, and to bear witness against social and political injustice.   That William Penn was held in prison, and eventualy released to found the Ameican Quaker Movement, is often lost in our current discussion of Quaker life.   Yes, Quaker Meetings can go out and sell salvation through Jesus Christ, but they would end up reducing the Quaker experience to something undistinguishable from other Christian sects.   The practice of enjoining individual religious experience with active participation in non violent witnessing of injustice has always been one of the core values of Quakers, and should not be shelved for any individual search for eternal salvation.\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tBillSamuel\n\n\n\nJoined: 06 Aug 2002\nPosts: 524\nLocation: Silver Spring, MD, USA\n\t\tPosted:  Fri Sep 23, 2005 9:05 am    Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tThe tradition is to proclaim the Everlasting Gospel far and wide.  This was not for the purpose of increasing membership organizationally, although it had that effect, but to present the Truth for people to consider whether their hearts responded to that as authentically from the Spirit.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe early Friends were proselytizers, and they were proselytizing about the living Christ as present Teacher, who is one and the same as Jesus of Galilee.  They held \"threshing meetings\" at which the Gospel was proclaimed, and the wheat accepted it and the chaff did not.  The \"Valiant Sixty\" spread the Everlasting Gospel far and wide.\n_________________\nBill Samuel, Silver Spring, MD, USA\n\n\nCo-Coordinator, Friends in Christ\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tMcGuffey\n\n\n\nJoined: 22 Sep 2005\nPosts: 154\nLocation: Long Beach, Ca.\n\t\tPosted:  Fri Sep 23, 2005 2:15 pm    Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tI'm sorry to disagree with you Bill, but your viewpoint seems oriented towards current Fundamentalist and Evangelical movements which have have a rather distorted view of the reasons early Quakers were persucuted.   They were rejecting the same structured and politically correct forms of worhip that you erringly advocate.  That there is a God spirit that occupies the hearts of all men in universal brotherhood is best expounded by the writings of Quaker Brother, John Woolman- \"There is a principle that is pure, placed in the human mind, which in different places and ages hath different names.  It is however, pure and proceeds from God.  It is deep and inward, confined to no forms of religion nor excluded from any, where the heart stands in perfect sincerity\".  I belive that you name Christ as that God force for YOUR inner light.  George Fox stated \"Walk cheerfully over the world, answering that of God in everyone\".   While born out of the Christian tradition, we should all be accepting that there are individual voices and callings that have names- and no names- which are equally valid religious experiences.\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tDave Thomas\n\n\n\nJoined: 07 Nov 2003\nPosts: 39\n\n\t\tPosted:  Sun Sep 25, 2005 9:36 am    Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tI don’t see any necessary conflict between the last two posts.  I posted the following quote from Barclay’s Apology in another thread (from proposition 6 on Universal Redemption).  It bears repeating, not because we have to accept Barclay as gospel, but because it explains the traditional Quaker position, which makes a whole lot of sense to me;\n\n\n\n\n\n“I confess that there is no other name by which to be saved.  But salvation does not lie in the literal knowledge of that name, but in the experience of what it signifies.  Those who merely know his name, without any real experience of its meaning, are not saved by it. But those who know the meaning and have experienced his power can be saved without knowing his name.”\n\n\n\n\n\nElsewhere, Barclay makes it clear that he believes that anyone who has accepted the spirit and who then learns about the historical Jesus Christ, will accept Him in name as well as in spirit.  The fact that many who identify themselves as Christians abuse the name of Christ should not cloud our thinking one way or the other.  Quakers, in spite of their differences, have an important testimony for Christians and non-Christians alike – a testimony of humility, simplicity and obedience to the essence of what Christ taught.  I consider myself “Christ centered”, or at least I am trying to be Christ centered, but I have fundamental differences from my Evangelical Christian friends and neighbors.  I believe we can accept Christ without rejecting His manifestations in other cultures and other ages.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we have something important to say, why shouldn’t we tell others.  That doesn’t mean that we should tell people they are going to hell, or be otherwise arrogant.  The idea that Quakers shouldn’t proselytize is a  modern development, found only in some branches of Quakerism.  I think even the more liberal branches of Quakerism have now started to realize that not only is it OK to proselytize, but it is necessary.  Otherwise, we are withholding a perspective that few others can provide.\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tjames\n\n\n\nJoined: 11 Jun 2004\nPosts: 576\nLocation: Minneapolis\n\t\tPosted:  Sun Sep 25, 2005 4:09 pm    Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\t\n\tQuote:\n\tElsewhere, Barclay makes it clear that he believes that anyone who has accepted the spirit and who then learns about the historical Jesus Christ, will accept Him in name as well as in spirit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is logically equivalent to saying, no one who knows about the historical Jesus and does not believe in his divinity, can be truly living in the spirit of Christ.

So, either Barclay contradicted his own universalist statements, or he did not agree with your statement above. I am not certain which is the case.\n\n\n\n\n\nI do believe that there is a sort of proselytizing that is consistent with the genuine universalist spirit of early Quakerism. It is not the sort that proclaims Christian dogma or doctrine, but the sort that proclaims the way of living that Christ represented for them.\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tBillSamuel\n\n\n\nJoined: 06 Aug 2002\nPosts: 524\nLocation: Silver Spring, MD, USA\n\t\tPosted:  Sun Sep 25, 2005 6:19 pm    Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tI unite with Dave Thomas. I fully agree with the Barclay quote.  I think McGuffey partly misunderstood me, and partly misunderstands the Quaker tradition.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response to James, I think he's taking a too narrow view of what Barclay said. Barclay wrote about the meaning of Jesus Christ. I'm not sure what he wrote necessarily applies to someone who has heard words about the historical Jesus Christ, but in a way that obscures or even contradicts the true meaning of Christ. I don't think Barclay was talking about a formulaic presentation of Christ.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt any rate, we mortals can't really know for sure the ultimate fate of others, or exactly how God views them. We need some humility about that, although recognizing that sometimes we may be given the gift of discernment and led to speak prophetically about someone.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly Quaker proselytizing certainly proclaimed the Gospel of Jesus Christ. This involved who Christ Jesus is, elaborated as to various offices by Fox and others, as well as the implications as to how we live our lives.\n_________________\nBill Samuel, Silver Spring, MD, USA\n\n\nCo-Coordinator, Friends in Christ\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tDave Thomas\n\n\n\nJoined: 07 Nov 2003\nPosts: 39\n\n\t\tPosted:  Mon Sep 26, 2005 9:34 am    Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tJames said;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tQuote:\n\tThis is logically equivalent to saying, no one who knows about the historical Jesus and does not believe in his divinity, can be truly living in the spirit of Christ.

Dogmatic Christians have created lots of rules and regulations about what it means to accept Christ, and about what it means to be divine.  I don’t know what divinity means other than being fully united in spirit with God.  I have had discussions about Christ with many “non-Christians”, and have found that most accept Christ, within the context of their own beliefs.  Many Hindus believe that Christ was an avatar of God, along with Rama and Krishna, the Koran teaches that Jesus was one of the great prophets preceding Mohammed, and many Buddhists accept that Christ was an enlightened being like the Buddha.  Have they accepted Christ or not?  I am not going to judge.  I do believe that anyone who learns of the pure example of selfless love that was Jesus, and who has recognized the same love in their own heart, will accept Christ, maybe not in some pre-defined, dogmatic way, but in the way that really matters.\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tjames\n\n\n\nJoined: 11 Jun 2004\nPosts: 576\nLocation: Minneapolis\n\t\tPosted:  Mon Sep 26, 2005 10:33 am    Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\t\n\tQuote:\n\tI do believe that anyone who learns of the pure example of selfless love that was Jesus, and who has recognized the same love in their own heart, will accept Christ, maybe not in some pre-defined, dogmatic way, but in the way that really matters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis speaks to my heart, and I am glad to hear it. Nonetheless, for many a Muslim or Jew or a Jewish nontheist Quaker such as myself, making an affirmation such as \"I accept Christ\" would amount to a violation of personal and spiritual integrity. In my case, it feels more honest to affirm that my highest aspiration is to care for others and our world with all my heart and mind and being. I can't say that I succeed, at least not as often as I hope, but it is my aspiration.\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDisplay posts from previous: All Posts\n1 Day\n7 Days\n2 Weeks\n1 Month\n3 Months\n6 Months\n1 Year\n\n Oldest First\nNewest First\n\n \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t   \t   QuakerInfo.com Forum Forum Index\n\t  -> Quaker Discussion\tAll times are GMT - 5 Hours\nGoto page  Previous  1, 2\n\t  \n\tPage 2 of 2\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t   \n\n\t  \t\n\tJump to: Select a forum\n \nGeneral\n----------------\nAnnouncements\\Site Questions\nIntroductions\nQuaker Q&A\nQuaker Discussion\n\n \n\n\n\n\nYou cannot post new topics in this forum\nYou cannot reply to topics in this forum\nYou cannot edit your posts in this forum\nYou cannot delete your posts in this forum\nYou cannot vote in polls in this forum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n",

          "BUPA’s response to the consultation document on RegulationBUPA’s response to the Department of Health consultation on the future regulation of \nhealth and adult social care in England \nIntroduction \n \nBUPA is a broadly based health and care organisation which manages health and \nsocial care operations in England regulated by the Healthcare Commission and CSCI \nrespectively. As an insurer, we also have an interest in the standards which are \napplied to health services and in the regulation of NHS commissioning services. \nBUPA operates health and social care facilities in Spain and provides health \ninsurance services around the world.  This experience from other countries informs \nour comments on the consultation document. \n \nBUPA welcomes the amalgamation of the health and social care quality regulators. \nWe supported this at the time of the Care Standards Act in 2000. We also broadly \nwelcome the Government’s proposals on professional regulation. However we are \nconcerned that the economic aspects of regulation have not been fully addressed in \nthese proposals.   \n \nBUPA supports consistent quality standards for all providers. As the independent \n1\nreport commissioned by the Department says: “minimum quality assurance/licensing \nmodels must be harmonised across the public and independent sectors.” \n \nWe support the delegation of competition issues from the Department of Health to an \nindependent body and their separation from the NHS management chain of \ncommand including SHAs. The Department of Health needs to consistently see its \nrole as ‘hands-off’ standard-setting for the health and care system, rather than \nregulation. Proposals need to reflect the growing ‘three-sector’ nature of services and \nbe even-handed across NHS, independent and voluntary sectors.  \n \nWe have a particular concern on quality grounds about the current exclusion of some \ncosmetic services providers from registration by the Healthcare Commission. \nProviders of services which include injection of cosmetic fillers and/or Botox should \nbe registered and inspected to ensure public confidence in quality assurance. We \nrecommend that these types of provider should be registered as soon as possible. \nThere are also other anomalies at present such as the difference in standards \napplied to independent hospital providers compared with private patient units within \nNHS and Foundation Trusts.  \n \nStructure of this response \n \nThis response is set out in four sections: an overview, specific proposals, detailed \ncomments on the document, and answers to the consultation questions. BUPA is \nhappy to publicise this response and to engage in further debate with stakeholders  \nabout these important issues. \n \nDuncan Innes \nPublic Affairs Manager \nBUPA House \n15-19 Bloomsbury Way \nLondon \nWC1A 2BA 020 7656 2600\n                                                 \n1\n The Future of Health and Adult Social Care Regulation 23 November 2006 \nhttp://www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidanceArticle/fs/\nen?CONTENT_ID=4140889&chk=oZ%2Be8y \nBUPA consultation response February 2007 innesd@bupa.com \n1\n   \n1. Overview \n \nIn our view, the regulation of health and social care should be approached from three \nrelated perspectives: institutional quality assurance, economic and competition \nissues, and professional standards. This consultation mainly addresses the first and \nsecond perspectives, but needs to bear in mind links with professional standards as \npart of an overall system. DH policy on quality regulation also has to dovetail with \nallied policies such as Choice, Payment by Results and Practice-Based \nCommissioning. We await the Commissioning Framework and proposed guidance on \ncompetition principles, with interest. \n \nThe regulatory system should fulfil the following criteria: \n \n• Assuring patients and the public that public services are safe, efficient, of an \nagreed high standard of quality, and provide good value for money \n \n• Correcting market failures and facilitating incentives for optimal provider \nperformance within a fair competitive framework \n \n• Balancing the conflicting priorities of cost, service quality and scope of service \n \n2\n• Meeting the statutory criteria for Better Regulation - that is, being \nproportionate, consistent, transparent, and targeted only at cases in which \naction is needed  \n \nThe background to this issue includes a historic realisation that quality assurance in \nhealth care is vital but that professional self-regulation has had high-profile failures, \nand institutional regulation has sometimes taken a ‘tick-box’ inspection approach. We \nwelcome the Government’s proposals to address public confidence in professional \nregulation in the recent White Paper. We also welcome the constructive moves of \nCSCI and the Healthcare Commission towards a more risk-based inspection regime \nwhich supports good outcomes. We fully support moves to address these issues and \nso aim for a world-class regulatory system in the UK.  \n \nIn principle, BUPA believes that the regulatory system should: \n \n1. always maintain its focus on the outcomes of health and social care for \nindividuals \n \n2. address  input, output and process measures as means towards the end of \nimproved outcomes, not as ends in themselves \n \n3. balance the interests of the taxpayer, providers and commissioners of care \nbut make the interests of the individual patient or client paramount \n \n4. set  fair rules for competition for all types of provider and commissioners \n \n5. minimise cost and burden on providers and commissioners, consistent with \nassuring the public that health and social care are efficient, effective and \neconomical \n \n                                                 \n2\n Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 S.2  \nBUPA consultation response February 2007 innesd@bupa.com \n2\n  These views are based on BUPA’s international experience and on research, as well \nas our experience of the recent evolution of quality assurance and inspection \nregimes for health and social care in the UK. \n \nOutcomes \n \nThere is a great opportunity to move the regulatory system towards monitoring \noutcomes rather than processes. Any revision to the Care Standards Act should take \nthis approach. This does require a clear vision of how to measure and assure quality \nof outcomes in both health and social care. The Government should consult widely \non this as a first step, rather than move rapidly to a revised Act, when the current \nlegislation has only lasted seven years. Regulation addressing outcomes must \ninclude commissioners and their role in contracting must be clearly differentiated \nfrom the proposed Regulator’s role. \n \nInput and process measures \n \nThe current Standards for Better Health and statutory standards for social care tend \nto focus on inputs and some processes, rather than on outcomes. While patient \nsafety must be assured, the approach of inspecting premises to see that they \nconform to fixed norms is stifling innovation. It also pre-empts investment decisions \nbecause the first priority for new investment must be to meet existing statutory \nstandards.  \n \nStandards for commissioners are at an even earlier stage of development but must \nbe developed and aligned with standards for providers. \n \nMaking the patient or client’s interests paramount \n \nThe quality assurance system which has evolved since the Care Standards Act 2000 \ndoes not always operate under this principle. The Health and Safety Commission’s \ninspection regime has also created a punitive culture which seeks to detect \ninfringements and penalise the organisation. The requirements of the Healthcare \nCommission, CSCI, the Health and Safety Inspectorate and other government \nagencies sometimes conflict. BUPA therefore welcomes moves to re-energise the \nInspection Concordat between the inspectorates. \n \nFair rules for competition \n \nHealth and social care markets will always be relatively heavily regulated for good \nreasons: protecting individuals and the public from harm, ensuring consistency and \ncoverage of services, and assuring value for money. But an inconsistent arena for \ncompetition has emerged from recent policy changes. Proposals should aim to \nimprove this situation and harness the benefits of competition, while avoiding the \nharm of anti-competitive practices. The role of commissioners is crucial in this \nprocess and so their regulation must pay regard to competition issues. \n \nMinimising costs and burdens \n \nDespite the rhetoric, the experience of the last ten years is of rising costs and \nburdens of regulation upon providers. Some benefits like consistent minimum \nstandards rightly incur costs. Quality regulators such as the Healthcare Commission \nand CSCI have to be paid for.  It is unfair that NHS providers do not currently bear \nthese inspection costs, while independent providers do. This anomaly must also be \ncleared up. \nBUPA consultation response February 2007 innesd@bupa.com \n3\n   \n \n \n2. Specific proposals \n \nWe now make a raft of specific proposals under the headings of fair competition, \nimproving health care and aligning social care standards. These comments have to \nbe seen in the light of very recent Government proposals on professional regulation, \nwhich we have not yet had time to fully digest. \n \nFair competition \n \nThe proposed new Regulator for health and social care should assure quality and \nvalue for money but should not police competition. The Office of Fair Trading should \ncontinue to oversee competition in health and social care markets. NHS bodies such \nas Strategic Health Authorities and PCTs should have no role in monitoring \ncompetition as this provokes a conflict of interest. Monitor’s role with respect to NHS \nFoundation Trusts should be restricted to supporting the evolution of NHS Trusts to \nfully self-sufficient status as FTs. \n \nImproving health care standards \n \nThe Regulator should over time move towards a consensus on assuring healthcare \noutcome standards. This clearly should involve the revised professional regulatory \nbodies. The timescale for laying Regulations under an Act does not allow for the \nnecessary reflection and experimentation to set up a lasting framework of standards. \nProviders in the independent sector have already seen three generations of \nstandards in recent years. Changes in standards are a hidden cost and burden on \nproviders. The Regulator should therefore be enabled to take the time to get \nstandards right. The Bill which is proposed is fundamental to quality and must be built \non a lasting consensus. \n \nFor both hospital and social care environments, the Government needs to ensure \nthat standards are not set by a multitude of bodies with varying interests, but \ncontrolled by a single body that incorporates all necessary views.  We support ideas \nof a ‘gatekeeper’ regulator to help ensure this. This issue is especially relevant with \nthe advent of the Information Centre and its potential overlap with the Healthcare \nCommission. \n \nAligning social care standards \n \nThe process of setting and improving standards in social care should not be derailed \nby the proposed merger of CSCI with the Healthcare Commission. Social care \nworkers are understandably nervous of medical dominance of an amalgamated \nRegulator. A parallel process of defining outcome standards for social care should be \nundertaken with a smooth transition from the existing input-based standards over a \nperiod of years. No single set of combined health and social care standards is going \nto satisfy the various stakeholders. Two sets of standards – health and social care -\nshould remain in place but with some convergence, based on consensus, over time. \nBUPA consultation response February 2007 innesd@bupa.com \n4\n   \n3. Comments on the document \n \nIn this section we comment on detailed points made in the document: \n \n1.8 Regulation needs to be risk-based: at present, there are pressures for CSCI \nand the Healthcare Commission to focus their energies on low-risk issues. \nFor example, hospitals which have good clinical governance face more \nscrutiny than single-handed independent GPs.  \n \n1.9 As noted above, the parallel consideration of professional regulation and of \npatient safety/incident reporting all needs to form part of one new system. \n \n1.13 The full title of the Healthcare Commission is ‘Commission for Healthcare \nAudit and Inspection’; however the financial audit of services has remained \nwith the Audit Commission. Both organisations should have a focus on value \nfor money. We note there is little in the document about the Audit \nCommission and that the proposed roles suggested for it in the independent \nreport have not been adopted. \n \n1.16 The integration of the Mental Health Act Commission into the proposed new \nRegulator must not dilute the focus on mental health issues. \n \n1.19 It is not clear how the alignment of the assessment of commissioning across \nhealth and adult social care will be implemented and what the impact on the \nsocial care sector may be. The regulation of commissioning needs more \nattention as we move towards legislation on regulation. \n \n1.20 The ‘no-change’ option adopted for Monitor must be challenged. As \nmentioned above, its role should be as a ‘receiver’ for failing Foundation \nTrusts, not as an economic or competition regulator. \n \n1.22 Conflicting requirements of the bodies listed in 1.22 and other statutory \nrequirements need attention. The increasing impact of EU Regulations and \nDirectives should also be noted. The respective roles of these bodies- \nespecially the NPSA and Health and Safety Executive - need to be \nconsidered carefully, alongside the new role for the proposed Regulator. The \nHSE in particular has taken an aggressive and punitive approach, taking legal \naction against leading providers, rather than adopting a risk-based approach. \n \n There may be scope for a statutory duty of co-operation between the \nproposed Regulator and other bodies. There may also be an argument for a \n‘gatekeeper’ function for one regulatory body to take the lead in dealing with \nproviders, in a specific sector. We welcome the review of the Concordat \nbetween the regulators. \n \n1.27 As noted above, these principles now have statutory force in the Legislative \nand Regulatory Reform Act 2006. There should also be a right of appeal for \nproviders against assessments if they are unfair or inconsistent. \n \n1.30 The document is still fairly focused on health and does not make much \nreference to the useful analogies with other sectors such as communications. \nAs the independent report observed, regulation in that sector focused on \nintroducing competition. There is a need to inject more competition into the \nhealth sector. \nBUPA consultation response February 2007 innesd@bupa.com \n5\n   \n1.32 We would particularly agree with the first and third bullet points- that \nregulation should encourage self-assessment, and take account of overall \nvalue for money. \n \n1.33 The diverging and different regimes for regulation in the four countries of the \nUK are imposing further costs and burdens on providers which operate in all \nfour. The issue of mixing economic and quality regulation in one organisation \nis essential to the debate. Lessons from other countries would be particularly \nvaluable here. We feel that independent assessment of commissioners is \nvital. The issue of ensuring the right information is available to individuals and \ncommissioners is also crucial. \n \n2.1 One of the biggest incentives for excellent standards of care may be to pay a \nfair price for that care. This is currently a major problem in social care, where \nthere is no fixed tariff for fees. But financial incentives apply to all types of \nhealth and social care provider and form part of any economic analysis of the \nsystem. \n \n2.2 National minimum standards are already subject to some local interpretation \nby inspectors and local health and social care authorities. We believe there \nshould be a short but firm list of national standards, focusing on principles for \nquality and safety, rather than detailed requirements. The current statutory \nNational Minimum Standards constrain innovation in both health and social \ncare. In social care, the point about attracting additional resources is also \nrelevant as Authorities in fact cut the overall fee per resident on the basis of \nbulk buying, when a care home increases its occupancy. There is no \nequivalent to PbR and so these anomalies will become starker as the new \nRegulator comes into being. \n \n2.4 Under ‘monopoly power’, the point about ‘monopsony’ is also relevant. Local \nhealth and social care authorities do exercise monopsony power, by \nwithdrawing contracts unilaterally or refusing to set realistic prices. For \nexample, one PCT has cut independent providers from its Choose and Book \nlist, and a Local Authority has proposed care homes fees which cut the price \nin real terms, without consultation. There are currently no effective routes for \nappeal against these misuses of monopsony power. \n \n As asymmetric information is widely quoted as a reason for restricting the \nmarket in health care, it deserves more attention. A strong role in providing \ninformation to overcome this problem is required. However, information \nrequirements should not breach commercial confidence. \n \n3\n2.8 Lessons from other countries: the independent background report is helpful \nbut we would include the drive towards patient safety and quality \nimprovement in the USA, such as work undertaken by the Institute for Health \nImprovement, in this list. Terminology is important: accreditation in Australia \nand other countries is a useful process for assuring basic standards in \nproviders. ‘Registration’ and ‘licensing’ may cover more or less rigorous \nprocesses of evaluation of providers. Independent providers in the UK are \nalready registered and can effectively have their license to operate removed. \n                                                 \n3\n The Future of Health and Adult Social Care Regulation 23 November 2006 \nhttp://www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/PublicationsPolicyAndG\nuidanceArticle/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=4140889&chk=oZ%2Be8y \n \nBUPA consultation response February 2007 innesd@bupa.com \n6\n  Whether and how these requirements will apply to NHS and Local Authority-\nmanaged providers is at the heart of arguments about the new regulatory \nsystem. We incidentally note the prominence of stronger commissioners in \nother countries.  \n \n We also note the comment in the report that ‘most countries use independent \nexperts in setting the tariff..’ Indeed, the Netherlands has an independent \nBoard of Healthcare Tariffs. The discussion on page 28 of the independent \nreport about the merits of outsourcing the setting of the tariff is useful.  \n \n4.10 It is not clear why an appeal function is not necessary in social care. \n \n4.12 CSCI has made a powerful impact in favour of social care and has sought to \ndrive up standards. There is some concern that their merger with the \nHealthcare Commission will dilute the focus on social care.  However, CSCI \nin its current form does not set relevant benchmarks which care homes can \nuse to compare their performance and strive to improve on.  An integrated \nbody must make it a priority to design appropriate means for benchmarking. \n \n4.19 We need more clarity on what information would be collected locally. It would \nbe helpful if it was focused on outcomes and resident satisfaction as opposed \nto detailed metrics.  This would be consistent with the principles outlined in \n1.28. Information requirements should not breach commercial confidence. \n \n4.21 We support the negotiation of prices for care locally rather than having a \nnational tariff, as this is consistent with the achievement of the objectives set \nout at 1.25 and 4.10. However, a Regulator needs to ensure that quality is not \ncompromised by Authorities setting unrealistically low fees. For 2007-08, \nsome Authorities are already proposing real-terms cuts in fees. This is \ninconsistent with the drive improve standards for residents and to give staff \nbetter employment conditions and training. \n \n5.5 Information and performance assessment: price information is commercially \nsensitive and so we would not support its publication. \n \n5.17 There is scope for looking at a national model contract for social care so as to \ncut down the transaction costs of rewriting contracts with each Local \nAuthority. \n \n \n4. Responses to consultation questions \n \n \nQuestion 1 \n \nThe rapid technological changes which are taking place in health care are not fully \nreflected in the consultation document. The current system is based on inspecting \npremises – mainly hospitals and care homes- but a future system needs to avoid \nossifying services which break down barriers between primary and secondary care. \nPublic health also suffers as it loses priority to healthcare services because they \nmust meet statutory standards. \n \nThe new system needs to reflect the importance of preventive and public health \nservices by setting outcome standards for these services. It also needs to cover GP \nBUPA consultation response February 2007 innesd@bupa.com \n7\n  and primary care providers consistently; at present, GP practices are not regulated \nbut private GPs are. \n \nQuestion 2 \n \nThe benefits of choice and competition can only be achieved with a light-touch \nregulatory system. But anti-competitive behaviour by NHS bodies such as recent \nawards of contracts without going out to tender must be constrained. Anti-competitive \ngovernment action like subsidies to NHS organisations must also be restrained. The \nOFT is in a good position to do so, along the lines suggested on page 28 of the \nindependent report already cited. \n \n \nQuestion 3 \n \nRegistration should focus on the organisations responsible for care and on assuring \nthat those organisations have risk management in place, rather than just counting \nbuildings. This will allow for the new Regulator to respond to innovations in service \ndelivery. \n \nQuestion 4 \n \nIt is fundamental that all types of provider should meet the same requirements for \nregistration. The practical limits to enforcing accreditation on NHS and Local \nAuthority providers are recognised. This means that the basic listing or registration of \nprovider organisations must be separated from quality assurance. \n \nIn social care, will people only be able to spend Individual Budgets with registered \nproviders? Will PCTs only be able to contract with registered providers?  \n \nQuestion 5 \n \nThe forthcoming Lyons Review on the role of local government will also be relevant. \nThe ability of local authorities to stifle competition and undermine the necessary \nprovision of social care in their area should be restrained. Local Authorities need to \nsee their role as promoting an effective market for social care. \n \nQuestion 6 \n \nAs for Question 4, common requirements for all types of provider are needed. \n \nBefore considering the amalgamation of two large independent bodies, it must be \nensured that each of those bodies is capable of covering its own immediate scope of \nregulation.  This comment particularly refers to the lack of Healthcare Commission \nregulation of cosmetic premises that may be performing invasive (e.g. Botox) \nprocedures, with no safety assurance.  \n \nIt is imperative to consider the Care & Social sector in Connecting for Health agenda, \nand what role the new regulatory body will play in ensuring both its integration and \nthe quality of evidence it submits. \n \nBUPA consultation response February 2007 innesd@bupa.com \n8\n   \nConsultation process \n \n \nBUPA has very much appreciated the Department’s approach to involving providers \nin this consultation process and in view of the complexity and importance of the \nissues, urges the Government to maintain a broad consultative approach to the \nfollowing stages. It would be unfortunate to rush into legislation without first ensuring \na lasting settlement on health and social care regulation. \n \n \n \nDuncan Innes  \nPublic Affairs Manager \nBUPA \n \nFebruary 2007 \nBUPA consultation response February 2007 innesd@bupa.com \n9\n  \n",

          "FARMINGTON FELLOWSHIP REPORT \n \nSUSAN J MOORE                                MARCH 2006 \n \nTeaching ‘Media’ through Concepts   \n \nMy intention in gaining a ‘Fellowship’ was to develop something practical \nwhich could be used by me and the R.E. department. I had already gained \na ‘Best Practice’ Award and developed some units of work based on \n‘Thinking Skills’. I was interested in developing teaching through \n‘concepts’ and decided to link this in with a teaching unit on ‘Media’. \n \nThe concept I chose to use was ‘morality’. I looked for parallel \nexperiences which the students could identify with and decided to use \nReality TV., advertising, music lyrics and ‘Soaps’. I then chose to relate all \nof this to religious faiths and ethical values. \n \nI was interested in researching how the media presents society and \npeople in society; why there has been a boom in Reality TV and why we \nhave become ‘fixated’ with ‘celebrities’. \n \nDuring my research time I took a school party to Auschwitz-Birkenau and \ncan only describe it as the ‘most profound’ experience I have \nencountered. I was bothered by what I saw and experienced there, and \nthe kind of senseless materialism and projection of how we look and \nbehave that we as a society have become fixated with. Somehow it \ndoesn’t fit in with what happened in Poland only 60 years ago. \n \nI am including examples of lessons which can be used for delivering \n‘Media’. They include different ideas for teaching and learning, starter \nactivities and assessment for learning. The majority have been tried and \ntested with Year 11 students. Some of their feedback was to do with ‘Big \nBrother’ and included quotes such as: - ‘people desire fame for money \nbecause that’s what life is all about.’, ‘There are two extremes of talent – \nsurgeons who are highly valued because they save lives, and the fact that \nit has become the norm to be a celebrity by having big boobs (you don’t \nneed talent for that!) \n \nAs a result of this research I watched many hours of R.T. and read many \nCelebrity magazines and magazines aimed at young men and young women. \nThere are 176 RT programmes planned for 2006 and there are 8 ‘weeklies’ published which focus on TV ‘soap’ stars and their intimate lives. \nThere are two types of celebrities – those that ‘use’ the media e.g. Simon \nCowell, Jade Goody; and those that are ‘used’ by the media e.g. Kate Moss \nand Jodie Marsh. \n \nIn conclusion there are many questions that have been unanswered for me \nbut have been used as a basis for discussion in class. \n• Why has ‘Little Britain’ become so popular when it portrays British \nsociety as ‘idle’, ‘immoral’,’ antisocial’ etc..? \n• Is RT a form of escapism because our lives are so mundane and \nboring? \n• Why are people so desperate for fame and are so willing to be \npatronised and insulted on TV? \n• Is the media at fault because it bombards us with sex, glamour, \nmoney and fame? (Simon Cowell recently announced that he wanted \na pay rise because £4.7 million wasn’t enough.) \n• What kind of society have we become when young people have ‘role \nmodels’ who are famous for being uneducated e.g. Jade Goody who \nis now worth £3.5 million. \n \nZOO Magazine recently published this advert – ‘Win a boob job for \nyour girlfriend, to transform her into a happier, more generous, \nintelligent, spiritual interesting person than she is today.’ \n \nAristotle said that the aim of life was ‘happiness’. This could be \nachieved through human excellence of qualities of character and \nqualities of mind.

Shrimsley\n\nDaily Telegraph, March 11th 1999, p. 5\n\n\nArgues that Gordon Brown is basically a tax-and-spend Chancellor whose\nskill has been to hide the tax while emphasising the spend. Those on middle\nand upper incomes have been deprived of mortgage tax relief and married\ncouples tax allowances; their pensions have been raided and their cars\nfurther taxed. The money has been redirected from couples to parents and\nfrom motorists to pensioners in accordance with Brown's sense of social\njustice. Taxes levied on motorists will be given to pensioners; upper rate\ntaxpayers will pay more in national insurance contributions to help finance\nfamily tax credits fro the less well-off.\n\n\nBUDGET 1999\n\n\nKey points of the budget from a welfare reform viewpoint are: \n\n\t a new 10p starting rate of income tax and basic rate tax cut to 22p.;\n\tmarried couples tax allowance scrapped and replaced by children's tax credit \n    worth up to ?416 per year;\n\t child benefit raised to ?15 per week for the first child and ?10 \n    for the second;\n\tWinter allowance for pensioners up from ?20 to ?100;\n\tminimum income guarantee for pensioners giving couples ?120 per week \n    and single people ?78; \n\t no national insurance contribution on first ?87 of weekly earnings \n    from 2001, and no contribution over ?575 a week. \n\n\nGuardian, March 10th 1999, p. 13-20; Independent Budget Review, 10th\nMarch 1999, 24 p; Times, March 10th 1999, p. 9-20; Financial Times, 10th\nMarch 1999, p. 1-29; Daily Telegraph Budget 99, 8 p.\n\n\nTHE CHANCELLOR WHO PRETENDS TO LOVE LOW TAX\n\n\nR. Preston\n\nFinancial Times, March 10th 1999, p. 4.\n\n\nCharacterises Gordon Brown as a chancellor who pretended to love low\ntaxes while in fact preserving Labours traditional values. Help in the\nbudget is targeted on the poor at the expense of the rich through the reconstruction\nof employees national insurance contributions and the replacement of the\nmarried couples tax allowance with the children's tax credit.\n\n\nTHE COMPREHENSIVE SPENDING REVIEW\n\n\nA. Britton\n\nCrucible, Jan-Mar 1999, p. 31-39.\n\n\nPresents a critique, from a Christian viewpoint, of the rhetoric of\nthe Comprehensive Spending Review, covering the level of spending and its\naffordability, the selection of priorities within the total, welfare and\nsocial security and the management of spending.\n\n\nFRIEND TO WORKING RICH AND POOR\n\n\nP. Stephens\n\nFinancial Times, March 10th 1999, p. 13.\n\n\nJudges the budget to be redistributive, shifting a modest amount of\nmoney from the higher paid to those at the bottom of the scale. Thus the\nnew family tax credit is paid for by increased National Insurance contributions\nfor those near the top of the income scale. The main beneficiaries, however,\nare those able and willing to work. The toughened conditions attached to\nthe New Deal provide the stick while a plethora of tax incentives and credits\nprovide the carrot. The poor are to be given opportunity and decent income,\nbut they must be willing to work for it.\n\n\nMIDDLE CLASSES AVOID THE PAIN OF REDISTRIBUTION\n\n\nN. Timmins\n\nFinancial Times, March 10th 1999, p. 6.\n\n\nGains for those in low paid work, much more money for families with\nchildren, and help for the least well-off are key features of a distinctly\nredistributive budget. But while the poor will gain at the expense of the\nbetter off, the chancellor's decision to boost purchasing power by ?6\nbn over the next three years means it is being done with relatively little\npain for the middle classes.\n\n\t    \tSearch Welfare Reform on the Web\t\n  \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n            \n            \n            \n\t\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n              \n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t Disclaimer | Privacy | Copyright ?

\n\n\n\nEveryone knows there is no such thing as a free lunch. \n\n\n\nWith Mr Blair you pay for lunch ��� and it never seems to turn up.\n\n\n\nBritain cannot carry on indefinitely spending more than it is earning without higher taxes or higher interest rates. \n\n\n\nIf we are to secure our future economic prosperity, government must once again start to live within its means.\n\n\n\nThere are two Britains today: private sector Britain, where people are working harder just to stand still, struggling just to make ends meet. \n\n\n\nAnd bureaucratic Britain, where money is no object, you spend what you like, you employ who you like.\n\n \n\nFor every job the private sector lost last year, the public sector took on almost two more. Britain cannot carry on like this without storing up huge problems for the future. \n\n\n\nYou know a country is living on borrowed time when government is the fastest growing industry in town.\n\n\n\nSo we have a plan to get a grip on government spending. \n\n\n\nThat's why a Conservative government will cut waste.\n\n\n\nThere'll be 20 per cent fewer MPs, and 20 per cent fewer government ministers. \n\n\n\nOver 160 quangos will disappear. \n\n\n\n235,000 bureaucratic posts will go. \n\n\n\nWe'll scrap the New Deal. \n\n\n\nThere'll be no new Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nAnd as for those unelected, unaccountable regional assemblies, the playthings of John Prescott, we'll get rid of them too.\n\n\n\nYes, these decisions are tough - but they are right. \n\n\n\nRight because they'll get resources to the front line - to our schools and hospitals - giving taxpayers value for their money.\n\n\n\nRight because they'll help pay of debt and avoid Mr. Blair's tax rises.\n\n\n\nAnd right because they'll enable a Conservative to lower taxes.  \n\n\n\nI believe that families are better at spending their hard earned cash than any politician.\n\n\n\nThat is why Conservatives will cut taxes.\n\n \n\nThe hardest hit by Labour's stealth taxes have been the older generation.\n\n\n\nIf you want to know about a family, look at how they treat their older relatives. \n\n\n\nAnd if you want to know about a country, look at how it cares for its older generation. \n\n\n\nHow a country treats the older generation is a test of its values. \n\n\n\nMany served our country in her greatest hour of need, fighting for liberty, freedom and Britain's independence for future generations. \n\n\n\nWe must never forget the contribution they have made - and continue to make to our communities. \n\n\n\nBut in Britain today too many pensioners are not shown the respect they deserve or given the dignity that is their due.\n\n\n\nThe older generation don't seem to feature in Mr Blair's New Britain. \n\n\n\nNew Labour's Britain is a country where the older generation has been airbrushed out.\n\n\n\nAs Frank Field, Mr Blair's own former social security minister, has said Labour took one of the best pensions systems in Europe and turned into one of the worst.  \n\n\n\nPeople who saved for their retirement suddenly found that the money they'd put aside simply wasn't there - that the value of their pensions had been destroyed by Mr Blair's stealth taxes.  \n\n\n\nAnd Labour have forced nearly half all pensioners are onto means testing.  \n\n\n\nPensioners quite rightly resent means testing.  \n\n\n\nIt is at total odds with the values of the forgotten majority - the people who work hard, who take responsibility for themselves and save for their retirement.\n\n\n\nMeans testing is wrong.  \n\n\n\nIt penalises people for doing the right thing - saving for their retirement.  \n\n\n\nIt sends a clear signal to the younger generation: \"Don't bother to save.  Spend whatever you can before you retire, because your future is one of dependency on the State\".  \n\n\n\nMeans testing is humiliating - forcing pensioners to go cap in hand to the State for what they are due.  \n\n\n\nAnd means testing is complicated.  That's why over one and a half million eligible pensioners don't even claim what they are owed.\n\n\n\nI want our country to honour our senior citizens, cherish their wisdom and care for their needs - a country where they can live in security and with dignity, respected and protected. \n\n\n\nTo those who have given so much, we must surely give what is their due.\n\n\n\nI will increase the basic state pension in line with earnings, making pensioners up to ��11 a week better off after four years. \n\n\n\nBy increasing the basic pension, we will free hundreds of thousands pensioners from the tyranny of means tested benefits - restoring their dignity, independence and self-respect. \n\n\n\nI will give every home where the adults are sixty five and over a fifty per cent Council Tax discount up to a maximum of ��500.  This will ensure that Council Tax bills for five million pensioners are cut.\n\n\n\nTaken together these proposals will mean that pensioner households will be up to ��1,000 a year better off - it's a thousand pounds.   \n\n\n\nAnd I will stop the disgrace of elderly people being forced to sell their homes, saying goodbye forever to their independence, to pay for their residential care.  \n\n\n\nIt's important that government rewards people who work hard and have contributed to our society.\n\n\n\nAnd it's important too that government upholds the law.\n\n\n\nSome people say I shouldn't talk about difficult issues like the abuse of our asylum system and those travellers who stick two fingers up to the law. \n\n\n\nBut we cannot make Britain a better place if we sweep difficult issues under the carpet. \n\n\n\nEveryone knows you won't fix a problem if you aren't even prepared to discuss it.  \n\n\n\nI'm not prepared to appease special interest groups because I believe passionately in fair play.  \n\n\n\nWe are all British and we should all have to play by the same rules. \n\n\n\nNor will I be distracted from doing what I believe is best for Britain by the smirking politics of Mr Blair or the woolly thinking of the Liberal Democrats. \n\n\n\nSo on each of these issues - on rewarding those who work hard and have contributed to our country, on schools, on hospitals, on crime and on immigration - we have a detailed, published Timetable for Action so you can hold us to account.  \n\n\n\nLook for this commitment in your paper, check it on the net, put it up on your fridge door - hold me to it.  \n\n\n\nAnd beware yet another election where Mr Blair says one thing to get your vote on polling day and does something quite different afterwards.\n\n\n\nMr. Blair is already secretly grinning about the prospect of his third victory.  \n\n\n\nImagine five more years of him.\n\n\n\nWell you don't have to settle for it.  \n\n\n\nIf you're thinking what we're thinking, it's time for urgent action on the things that really matter:  \n\n\n\n-                     Reward for hardworking Britons;\n\n\n\n-                     School discipline;\n\n\n\n-                     Cleaner hospitals;\n\n\n\n-                     More police; and\n\n\n\n-                     Controlled immigration.\n\n\n\nSo I say again, the choice before voters on May the fifth is very clear.  \n\n\n\nThey can either reward Mr. Blair for eight years of broken promises and vote for another five years of talk.  \n\n\n\nOr they can vote Conservative, to support a party that's taken a stand and is committed to action on the issues that matter to hard working Britons.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Send to a friend\n\n\n\n\n\n         \n\n        \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t        About Rt Hon Michael Howard QC MP ��\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBookmark with:\n\tDel.icio.us\n\tDigg\n\tFacebook\n\treddit\n\tStumbleUpon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Related news\n\n  \n\n          \n\n \t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n            Change is on its way\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n            David Cameron: Berlin Security Conference speech\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n            David lays out policy plans\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n            \"We will fight - Britain will win\"\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n            Francis Maude: We know the country's ready.

The scheme is part of the Big Lottery Fund's £155million commitment to support children's play. \n  The East Cambridgeshire Better PLAY Project will transform play facilities at twelve sites across the district over three years. In the first year of this project the villages of Isleham and Stetchworth will receive funding for creative improvements to their play spaces to engage young people. \n  Also as part of the project, a Play and Physical Activity Co-ordinator will be employed to develop play activities across East Cambridgeshire, particularly in communities that lack suitable facilities or opportunities. \n  Finally, funding will also provide investment into play spaces for teenagers; an area that is often overlooked when designing play opportunities. \n  Cecilia Tredget, Deputy Chief Executive, said: \"This lottery award is excellent news for children and young people in East Cambridgeshire. The funding will be a catalyst, not only for increasing play activities and opportunities but for the growth in local partnership working to create a long-term legacy for play in the district''. \n  \"It is important we provide positive activities that engage young people of all ages particularly the hard to reach. The Better Play Project will target rural areas where young people are disadvantaged due to limited access to play facilities. We have established a Play Partnership that includes various partners across the district to ensure our play services meet the needs of local young people.\" \n  Sara Betsworth, Head of Region for the East of England, said: \"This investment of lottery money will go a long way in bringing stimulating and challenging play to children and young people across East Cambridgeshire. In isolated or disadvantaged areas it's often difficult to access play facilities and equipment; this funding will ensure more families can enjoy better play for their children.\" \n  Further information: \n Big Lottery Fund \n Public Enquiries Line: 08454 102030 \n Textphone: 0845 6021 659 \n Full details of the Big Lottery Fund programmes and grant awards are available on: http://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk \n  Notes to Editors \n  * For more information about the East Cambridgeshire Better PLAY Project contact Phillip Turner, Senior Sports & Leisure Officer, East Cambridgeshire District Council on 01353 616382 or email phillip.turner@eastcambs.gov.uk. \n * The Big Lottery Fund will support children's play with £155 million through: \n - the £124 million Children's Play programme, with funds available to every local authority area in England; \n - a separate £16 million Playful Ideas programme focussing on innovation; and \n - a £15 million grant to the Children's Play Council, part of the National Children's Bureau, to fund England-wide development and support. \n * Under the Children's Play programme, in deciding how best to allocate the available funds to each authority the Big Lottery Fund have allocated: 50 per cent of the funding on the basis of child population, and 50 per cent of the regional population living in the most deprived 20% of Super Output Areas included in the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004. The minimum amount allocated to any local authority is £200,000. \n * Under Playful Ideas registered charities; voluntary or community groups; charitable or not-for-profit companies; social enterprises; and town and parish councils can apply. However, other organisations, such as schools, can work in partnership on Playful Ideas projects. \n * The Big Lottery Fund awarded a grant to the Children's Play Council a strategic alliance of organisations working to promote the importance of play and to stimulate better play opportunities. Play England - a project of the Children's Play Council - lead on this work by helping agencies to develop play strategies and apply for Children's Play funding.

It is a compilation of (unedited) information and views supplied by users like yourself. It is not a conventional tourist guide!\n\n\nIn most cases, the information in each section has been submitted by more than one contributor \n(the credits at the bottom of the page list some, but not all, of the contributors) and some of it dates back to the 1970s.\n\n\nWe make no claims as to the accuracy of the information in the Guide - our only purpose is to provide a forum for users to share their knowledge and opinions. So please keep a large bag of salt handy and be prepared to read between the lines!\n\n\nIf you disagree with a comment, or information is out of date, please submit an update! The contributors come from all walks of life, and their opinions are bound to be subjective, so if your view isn't represented, please speak up and contribute to the balance of the Guide. See below in the 'Have Your Say' section for how to add your voice.\n\n\nIf we have helped you out or made you laugh you can buy us a pint.\n\n\n\n \nHave Your Say...\n\nThe Knowhere Guide depends entirely on real users for information. Please feel free to join in. \nYou can tell us more about Docklands. \nThis is also the method to use if you want to correct some of the information already here. \n(But please remember you're not mailing the person who actually wrote whatever-it-is.) \n\n\nYou can use the add an event form\nto tell us about events happening in Docklands.\n\n\nOr, if you'd just like to leave a message for other users of this site, take a look at The Knowhere Board (handy if you're just trying to get in touch with someone). \n\n\n\n\nCredits\n\n\nAll the information in the Knowhere Guide has been contributed by users over the years.

Tonto gives him a blank look.  ‘What do you mean “we”, paleface?’\n\n\n\n\n\nI am trying to control my we.  It’s tough, the meeting has been long and heated and now there’s we all over the place.  ‘We have to increase our margins,’ they say, ‘we’re in a competitive market.’  ‘Can we do that?’  I reply, felling that we dribbling out of my mouth.  ‘Won’t someone complain?’  ‘That leaves us in an awkward position.’  And with each burst of we, I’m getting sucked deeper into the grand myth that keeps us all here and convinced that we’re doing something terribly important.  The idea that I am Part of Something Big.\n\nIt’s all about the language.  Orwell knew this – in the afterword to 1984 he explains the whole business with newspeak.  Change the way people talk, limit their vocabulary, and you limit the way they think.  I’m trying to hold on to the truth of the matter.  Keeping, if you’ll pardon an extension of the pun, an I on things.  Remembering that I am renting myself to them at a monthly rate, in return for which I will provide a certain amount of brainpower and typing skills as detailed in the contract I signed, with a heavy heart, a few months ago.  That all of this business I’m involved in is making someone else, somewhere on the top floor, considerably richer than it’s making me.\n\nBut in this air conditioned room there is no I, there is only we.  And every time I let we out it’s changing how I think. Suddenly I’m personally involved in this thing. Somehow me and the suit on the top floor are in this together. No contracts, no ugly business with money, just a joyful participation in the Great Endeavour of Commerce.  Before you know it I am taking one for the team, staying long after hours and going to bed panicking about things that aren’t my problem at all.\n\nWorryingly it’s beginning to leak into my social life.  ‘How’s the job?’ people ask (usually with horrified curiosity at my defection to the corporate ranks).  ‘Oh,’ I reply, ‘We’re doing something big at the moment. We…’ and I notice that everyone’s looking at me.  Then something awful happens – I try to correct myself and discover that it takes an enormous mental effort, I can feel gears clashing in my head as I try to deprogram my own grammar.  ‘…that is,’ I flounder, ‘I…I mean they…I’ve been employed to help them…’  And so on, but it’s too late.  I am losing the words to express my indenture, just thinking about the real economic relations is becoming unnatural.  I’ve just realised what false consciousness actually feels like as it makes its early assaults on the brain.  \n\nI’ll fight back, I promise. As the we is flung about in air-conditioned rooms I will try to keep in mind that glorious punchline. ‘What do you mean…?’\n\n\n\nWatch this space for more dispatches, as our correspondent tries to avoid getting fully digested.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t \t\n\n\nMarch 17, 2006\n\tINSIDE THE WHALE: Dispatches from within corporate leviathan\n\tINTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY HIJACKED BY BIG BUSINESS\n\tNEWS IN BRIEF\n\n\n\n\nDownload\nDownload A4 fact sheet on the General Union of Oil Employees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tpowered by the webbler | tincan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In 1974, Local Government re-organisation in Wales led to the renaming of Civil Parishes as Communities, and the creation of Community Councils in urban areas. These bodies inherited miscellaneous records and other papers from their predecessor bodies. Conwy Community Council received papers from Conway Borough Council and Conwy Corporation, and the town charters.  Other bodies represented are Caerhun parish, Capel Curig Parish Council and Community Council, Dolgarrog Parish Council, Dolwyddelan Parish Council, Llanbedr y Cennin Parish Council and Community Council (and earlier records of the Overseers of the Poor for Llanbedr y Cennin Parish), Llansanffraid Glan Conwy Parish, Penmachno Parish Council and Community Council, and Trefriw Parish Council.\n\n\nCONTENT\n\n\n Scope and content/abstract: Records accumulated by Conwy Community Councils, Caernarfonshire, 1331-1983, including poor rate books, Caerhun Parish, 1889-1896; records of Capel Curig Parish Council, 1905-1977; Conwy Borough Charters, 1331-1876; records of Conwy Corporation, 1950-1974; minute books of Dolgarrog Parish Council, 1899-1944; minute books of Dolwyddelan Parish Council, 1894-1929; records of Llanbedr y Cennin parish Overseers of the Poor, Parish and Coummunity Councils, 1798-1983; records of Llansanffraid Glan Conway parish, 1838-1842; and Trefriw parish council minute books, 1895-1962.\n  \n\nACCESS AND USE\n\n\nLanguage/scripts of material: English, Welsh, Latin\n\n\nSystem of arrangement: Arranged into the following: Caerhun parish; Capel Curig Parish Council; Conwy Borough Charters; records of Conwy Corporation; Dolgarrog Parish Council records; Dolwyddelan Parish Council records; Llanbedr y Cennin Parish Council records; Llansanffraid Glan Conwy Parish records; Penmachno Parish Council records; Trefriw Parish records.\n\n\nConditions governing access: No restrictions\n\n\nConditions governing reproduction: Usual copyright regulations apply\n\n\n\nFinding aids: A hard copy of the schedule is available at Conwy Archives Service.\n\n \nLanguage codes: engwellat\n\nARCHIVAL INFORMATION\n\nAppraisal, destruction and scheduling information: All records have been retained\n\nAccruals: Accruals are not expected\n\n                 \nArchival history: Deposited at Gwynedd Archive Service.

I am not sure how long they are kept for and 7 years might be too long but it might be worth contacting patient records at the hospital where you were admitted. I got my notes for the births of both of my children, the second of which coincided with my stroke and although some of the terminology was a bit technical,it was very interesting to see a specific timeline over which my pralysis evolved. On admission the little stick man diagram that they drew (it was a maternity hospital after all) showed weak areas, a few hours on,the diagram stated that there was no movement. I have yet to get my epic notes from the stroke unit but I think these might be oo technical and also, like I said, I don't feel I need them now.\n\nYou are entitled to see your own notes though there is usually a charge for photocopying etc.\n\nBest of luck if you go down that route\n\nClaire\n\n\nMessages in This Thread\n\n\n\tmemory loss -- claire -- Friday, 1 June 2007, at 12:21 p.m.\n\tRe: memory loss -- ruth clark -- Saturday, 2 June 2007, at 9:43 a.m.\n\tRe: memory loss -- Michael Palmer -- Saturday, 2 June 2007, at 1:21 p.m.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tRe: memory loss -- margaret curry -- Friday, 1 June 2007, at 10:50 p.m.\n\n\n\n\tRe: memory loss -- Julie Cancea -- Friday, 1 June 2007, at 5:22 p.m.\n\n\n\n\tRe: memory loss -- ClaireC -- Friday, 1 June 2007, at 2:47 p.m.\n\tRe: memory loss -- CMiguel -- Friday, 1 June 2007, at 5:31 p.m.\n\tRe: memory loss -- Carole Young -- Saturday, 2 June 2007, at 9:43 a.m.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tRe: memory loss -- ClaireC -- Friday, 1 June 2007, at 1:55 p.m.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t| View Thread | Post Response | Return to Index | Read Prev Msg | Read Next Msg |\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Password: \n\n\nDifferent strokes Discussion Board is maintained by Webmaster with WebBBS 3.21.\n\n",

Une mise en perspective\n\n22 - 23 avril 2005,\n\nSalle Marie-Thérèse (1er étage), Palais des Académies, Rue Ducale, 1000 Bruxelles\n\n\n\n\nJournées d'étude du Groupe de contact FNRS Histoire comparée des sciences  organisées conjointement avec Studium Generale groupe de contact pour l'histoire des universités\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\n\nIn 1927, King Albert I held a memorable speech in favour of the foundation of a national institute for science funding. One year later, the FNRS/NFWO was created, to become the major institution for promoting scientific research in Belgium. It marked a major turning point in the history of science in Belgium and enabled in due time the development of a modern science policy.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the usual emphasis put on this single event, has tended to obscure other aspects of the complex interaction between science, government and industry. Obviously, this interaction did not start in 1928, nor was the creation of the FNRS/NFWO a ready made solution to the long standing problem of stimulating scientific innovation. The gradual expansion of political influence in scientific research was sometimes viewed as harmful for the development of pure science and the necessary objectiveness of scientific studies. The emergence of new professional profiles (assistants, researchers) introduced important changes in the organisation of university staff or the management of research activities.\n\n\n\n\nThis workshop will attempt to put the creation of the FNRS/NFWO into its proper historical perspective. Belgian science policy will be analysed on a longer historical time scale. Also, attention will be drawn to key figures and developments in twentieth century science in Belgium. To provide the necessary framework for historical analysis, the Belgian situation will be compared to parallel developments in other European countries.\n\n\n\n\nInformations and registration\n\n\n\n\nvantiggelen@memosciences.be\n\njjheirwe@ulb.ac.be\n\nhttp://www.memosciences.be\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to News and Events index\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\tLatest update to this page: \n\t\t\t\tFriday 28 October 2005 10:18:00\n\n\t\t\t\tCopyright | Disclaimer\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n",

(£7.99), the new book from John Harris, confronts the question being asked by millions all over the country who, until now, have been loyal Labour voters. \n\nHarris looks at the war in Iraq. He goes through what’s happened in hospitals and schools, and catalogues many of the issues which have led people to look for an alternative to Labour. He also lists the Labour MPs who have voted against the war, top-up fees and so on to help people decide which way to vote. \n\nHis analysis of the alternatives—the SNP, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Respect Coalition—will not please everyone. However, the fact that he has written the book is an indication of the problems Blair will face in mobilising the working class voters he will have taken for granted in the past.\n\nJohn Harris’s previous book, The Last Party (£7.99), about Britpop and Blair is also worth a read.\nTo order books write to Bookmarks, the socialist bookshop, 1 Bloomsbury Street, London WC1B 3QE, phone 020 7637 1848, e-mail enquiries@bookmarks.uk.com or go to www.bookmarks.uk.com\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\ttop of page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t",

It is intended to help industrial operators move towards greater environmental sustainability.\n\nThe directive is implemented by the Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations 2000. However, these PPC regulations are expected to be superseded by the Environmental Permitting Regulations in 2008.\n\nUnder IPPC, a system of permits covers plant operating conditions, emission limits for certain substances to air, land and water and annual reporting of pollutant releases. \n\nIf necessary, permits include measures both for the management of waste generated by the installation and for the protection of soil and groundwater. Where appropriate, permits also have conditions to minimise the impact of a polluting activity beyond our national boundaries.\n\nEmission limits and operating conditions are based on Best Available Techniques (BAT), taking into account the technical characteristics of the installation, its geographic location and local environmental conditions. Measures beyond BAT may also be required, to achieve Environmental Quality Standards.\n\tIPPC Directive - who does it affect?\n\n\t\tThe directive requires industrial and agricultural activities with a high pollution potential to have a permit which can only be issued if certain environmental conditions are met \n\tIPPC Directive - what is our role? \n\n\t\tWe are responsible for regulating the majority of all sites that need a PPC permit to operate\n\n \n\tRead Defra's practical guide to IPPC\n\n\t\tA good starting point to understand more about Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC).  \n\tRead the IPPC Directive\n\n\t\t\n\tRead the Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) regulations\n\n\t\t\n\n\n   \n \n  \n\t\t  \n  \n \n  \n \n\n \n\n \n\t\t\tAdditional links: regional information\n \n \n   \n    Anglian | Midlands | North East | North West | South West | Southern | Thames | Wales\n \n  \n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tBack to top of page\n \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t   \n\t\t\t    ©The Environment Agency 2007\n \n\t\t\t     \n\t\t\t      Privacy Policy\n \n\t\t\t  \n \n\t\t\t   \n\t\t\t    Author: Amanda Harley | enquiries@environment-agency.gov.uk\n \n\t\t\t  \n \n\t\t\t  \n \n\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t",

Will we have to suffer this bloke as well calling himself the Prince of Wales. \n\nAs an aside - I was watching the new series on S4C, Tywysogion, (princes) with English subtitles and I hadn't realised that there was a king of all Wales at the time of Edward Confessor in England, Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, who united the country and even took land from Edward. If he hadn't been killed by a traitor in 1063 it's interesting to think how things would have turned out following William's conquest of England three years later.\n\nHowever, a few seats away from prince William was Peter Hain, enjoying a game of rugby by two Balkanised teams. Of course, if Hain had his way there wouldn't be a Welsh or Irish team just one big cuddly British team of Brotherhood and Unity. Of course, on the other hand, Hain may just be a hypocrite with no principles.\n\nThe one great thing from the game was seeing Aled Brew wear the red jersey. No doubt it's further confirmation that the CRE are right and that independence for Wales would mean racial tension here. Bollocks!\n\nThe existence of a national rugby team, like independence, gives Wales the opportunity to build a civic nationality. Aled Brew, a black Welsh speaking  proud Welshman, with a Welsh first name, is living testament of this blindingly obvious truth. It's the CRE and Hain who want to keep Welsh identity an ethnic identity not Welsh nationalists! \n\n      \n \n    \n\n    \n    \n        \n          Posted by Nicholas Michael Morgan\n        \n       \n        \n       \n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n  \n    \n      \n         \n      \n    \n  \n\n       \n\n\n      \n        \n       \n\n\n      \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n      \n        \n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \n          0 comments:\n        \n      \n\n\n      \n\n\n      \n        Post a Comment\n      \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n       \n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      Newer Post\n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n      Older Post\n      \n    \n\n    \n      Home\n      \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n   \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n  \n  Subscribe to:\n  \n     Post Comments (Atom)\n  \n  \n\n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n      \n  \n  \n    About Britnat Watch!\n\n  \n  \n    We are proud Welsh Nationalists not affiliated to any political party, dedicated to exposing the corruption, and failure of the three main British Nationalist Parties in Wales (Labour, Conservatives and Lib Dems).\n Email us your examples.\nWe completely oppose the racist and facist views of the BNP.

Bit of a long one I'm afraid......\n\n\n\n\n\nMy 22 year old horse had a mild laminitis bout last Spring due to Cushings disease complications. It showed bruising in all four feet over a period of about three months which eventually grew out one by one. \n\n\n\n\n\nSix weeks ago my blacksmith found an abscess in his left forefoot which he partly pared away, applying some hoof putty. Last week when he took the shoe off, about 3 inches of white line separation has appeared on the outside of the foot. He was shod again but when I put him back out in the field, there was muddy water squirting out one of the nailholes about an inch up his foot when he put weight on it. \n\n\n\n\n\nCan someone please advise if this is likely to cause futher infection in that foot and if it is normal for white line separation to develop after an abscess ?? Is there anything I can do to help maintain a healthy hoof ??? Will it grow out ??? I have the added complication that he has severe DJD and gets extremely sore if he is in for more than overnight - he's on 2 or 3 bute a day and has been for 4 years (his liver function is the top end of normal !!). \n\n\n\n\n\nThe other thing I have noticed is that the top 1/2 inch of hoof wall around the coronet band on that foot appears to be indented/constricted all the way around. I've been strip grazing him and haven't noticed any laminitic signs - digital pulse, stance, increased lameness (not really paranoid) so was wondering if this may be just down to restricted grazing ?? If there is sinking of the pedal bone, does the depression described appear all the way around the hoof ??? Does it appear on the fleshy part of the coronet band or on the hoof wall ?? Want to keep him as happy and comfortable as possible and try to counter any further potential problems.\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tjohn ford\n\n\n\nJoined: 25 Oct 2002\nPosts: 477\nLocation: Pucklechurch, Bristol.\n\t\tPosted: Sun Jun 04, 2006 9:46 pm    Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tDear Bev, just a very quick answer as I’m off to bed. The laminitis is a result of the Cushions disease, and not the other way around. Also because of the Cushions there is a breakdown of the immune system. Your farrier and veterinary surgeon are fighting a loosing battle with nature in the advanced stages of Cushions disease. We all hope one day there will be a cure for this, but I haven’t heard of anything yet. I'm very sorry to say this, but it is time to call the end of your horse's day's, to end anymore suffering.\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tadmin\nSite Admin\n\n\nJoined: 14 May 2002\nPosts: 518\n\n\t\tPosted: Sun Jun 04, 2006 10:20 pm    Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tThat is the worst case scenario, but there are degrees of severity, and things may not be that bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe abscess: Can someone please advise if this is likely to cause futher infection in that foot and if it is normal for white line separation to develop after an abscess ?? No and yes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there anything I can do to help maintain a healthy hoof ??? Occasional abscesses are impossible to avoid. Will it grow out ??? Yes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other thing I have noticed is that the top 1/2 inch of hoof wall around the coronet band on that foot appears to be indented/constricted all the way around. I've been strip grazing him and haven't noticed any laminitic signs - digital pulse, stance, increased lameness (not really paranoid) so was wondering if this may be just down to restricted grazing ?? \n\n\n\n\n\nIt may be, but often chronic laminitis can go on without signs of lameness.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there is sinking of the pedal bone, does the depression described appear all the way around the hoof ??? Yes but usually more at the toe. Does it appear on the fleshy part of the coronet band or on the hoof wall ?? Usually just on the hoof wall. \n\n\n\n\n\nWant to keep him as happy and comfortable as possible and try to counter any further potential problems.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is hard to give specific advice about your horse without knowing more. But I would hope that you can keep him comfortable with support from your vet and your farrier and by getting to know how best to manage your horses laminitis given his particular personality and characteristics and the environment in which he is kept.\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tBevGeegee\n\n\n\nJoined: 22 Sep 2002\nPosts: 3\nLocation: Nottingham/Derby\n\t\tPosted: Mon Jun 05, 2006 8:16 am    Post subject: Thanks.....\t   \n\t\n\n\tFor the replies - it gives me a bit more confidence that the white line separation will grow out now. He's not overweight, his coat and eyes are bright and he thought it really funny the other day to push my friends daughter on her bum in a bucket of water - always had a sense of humour !!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the minute, Indy seems content, trots and canters quite happily, albeit a bit lame !!!! He's eating his grub as enthusiastically as ever, loves grooming and being with my other horse and can't wait for visits from people to give him a fuss....\n\n\n\n\n\nI know that this disease and it's related problems are progressive and he was diagnosed at 17 as having Cushings, so he's living on borrowed time. I'm sure from knowing him inside out for the last 14 years that I'll know when the time comes with him. I'm sure it's not yet for a little while longer.........when that light in his eyes goes out - that'll be the time. \n\n\n\n\n\nThanks again for the replies and if anyone else can offer advice, I'd be more than grateful !!!\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tcowboy_bc\n\n\n\nJoined: 07 Dec 2005\nPosts: 6\nLocation: canada\n\t\tPosted: Tue Jun 06, 2006 1:02 am    Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tAdvice? ask here.\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.horseshoes.com/forums/\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tGiles\n\n\n\nJoined: 15 May 2002\nPosts: 179\nLocation: Wales\n\t\tPosted: Tue Jun 06, 2006 6:24 am    Post subject: Saleman\t   \n\t\n\n\tCowboy,\n\n\n             She got the good advice, from both a Farrier and a Vet.

The conference attracted over 400 representatives of the library, publishing and research communities, and there was an impressive range of speakers from the US as well as across Europe. \n\n    There was a sense that the debate on open access is beginning to move on at a European level, following the policy statement on open access in December from the European Research Advisory Board (EURAB), and the shorter statement from the European Research Council. \n\n    Shortly before the conference, the Commission issued its own communication setting out some actions that it intends to take on access to Community-funded research results, the co-funing of research infrastructures, and policy debate and co-ordination. There is much still to debate. Organisations from across Europe, including SPARC Europe and JISC presented a petition with 20,000 signatures urging the Commission to accept the recommendations of the report of the EU-funded Study on the Economic and Technical Evolution of the Scientific Publication Markets of Europe'. Specifically, the petition asks the Commission to establish a European policy mandating published articles arising from EC-funded research to be available after a given time period in open access archives, and to explore with Member States whether and how such policies and open repositories could be implemented. \n\n    At the same time, 43 publishing organisations have issued the Brussels Declaration laying out ten principles through which scientific, technical and medical (STM) publishing can continue working for the benefit of science and society. \n\n        All this activity seems to presage further developments in the scholarly communications world over the next few months. The RIN is issuing later this week a statement of the public policy goals for scholarly communications in the UK. It has been endorsed by the key representative bodies for libraries and publishers in the UK, as well as the Wellcome Trust and JISC. We hope it will prove a fruitful contribution to the development of policy in this area.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: RIN Team Blog \n \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      How would you answer these easy questions?\n\n    Posted by James Brown, 16 Feb 2007\n\n    \n\n\t\n\t\t4 comments\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAdd your views\n\t\t\n\t\t  \t\t\n \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tNext week, we're going to be publishing an important new document. So this week, I've been thinking about how best we can disseminate it. Amongst the usual methods (e.g. the media), I've also been looking at getting the word out on the web. \n\nThere are a large number of issues here, and I think organisations in the HE / research / library / information sector are a long way off from figuring answers. There aren't any established norms, and a lack of consistency in approach. For example - how would you answer these questions...\n\n\tThere are blogs that I read, which I know carry authority and are popular. Should I email the authors to ask if they will mention our new publication? \n\tWhat can I offer in return? \n\tWhat about smaller or niche blogs? \n\tHow are relationships developed - \n\n\tIs it about comments? \n\tMutual links? \n\tTargeting them with useful content? \n\tEmailing them? \n\n\n\n\tFrom an ethical perspective, should you disclose that someone has asked you to mention the report? (cf. publication ethics) \n\tHow or when can people say no? \n\tOr should I just hope that the document is so compelling and interesting that it will arrive on blogs without me having to get in touch? \n\n\nA recent email I exchanged with Brian Kelly of UKOLN (who keeps a blog asking lots more questions) helped me sum up what I think is the root of the problem:\n\nHow much time should an organisation devote to developing strategic relationships with web-editors and blog-authors? And how open are we all to fostering such relationships?\n\n \nSo here's a call to action. Get in touch!

Publishing meets social networking?  OK, it's yet another cliché, but there was quite a buzz about the potential to develop post-publication interactivity on journal content.  In a sense, this stretches the scope and meaning of 'publication' by allowing for open commentary and annotation, and hence dialogue and debate, on a dynamic and ongoing basis.  The notable example presented at the meeting was the case of PLoS One, but there may be others.  This is not a substitute for peer review, but could provide for a form of quality assessment by facilitating critical discussion by the community.  Hype or hope?\n\n   \n\n  2. How do researchers (and, in the case of clinicians, practitioners) use journals?  The meeting pointed to cases of poor or even dangerous conclusions being reached through reading abstracts rather than whole journal articles.  Contenting oneself with reading just the abstract is hardly unusual, and there are all sorts of good reasons for this - one of which may be that only the abstract is freely available (which, of course, open access proponents don't fail to underline). The problem is when this leads to misinterpretation, especially if the abstract is poorly-written. So is there a case for seeking empirical evidence on how journals are used - and perhaps by extension on how content is cited?  What research has there been in this area?  Comments welcome...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: RIN Team Blog | journals | publishing \n \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      British Library\n\n    Posted by Michael Jubb, 09 Feb 2007\n\n    \n\n\t\n\t\t0 comment\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAdd your views\n\t\t\n\t\t  \t\t\n \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t­\n\n  As many of you will have read, there are fears that the British Library will face cuts in the coming Spending Review, and it has produced a briefing note setting out what the implications would be. It has set up a forum for supporters to keep everyone informed and engaged with developments. It is also asking supporters to write to supporters_forum@bl.uk  to say why the British Library is important to them, and to give permission to use what they say to help make the case to Government.\n\n   \n\n  There is also a petition on the new e-petitions service on the\n\n        10 Downing Street website.

It's made by a cultural anthropologist who explains the story of web 2.0, and how it's changing the world. \n\nIt's been called \"about as starry-eyed as techno-optimism gets,\" and in truth it does neglect to mention that digital assets can be newly controlled as well as newly distributed.\n\nOn the other hand... \n\nApple's CEO Steve Jobs written an open letter to the music industry coming out against DRM. I should say that again - Apple is now against DRM.\n\nDigital Rights Management (an umbrella term for technologies that copyright owners have used to control access and usage of digital data - wikipedia) is a very controversial topic, with critics saying that is used to restrict fair-use, anti-competitive, and not in the spirit of an open web future.\n\nApple's iTunes Music Store has used DRM for years - to the extent that you can't play music bought there on any device other than an iPod. If Apple really are ready now to change to non-DRM, this could be a huge step-forward. \n\nCynics have called it link-bait and propaganda, but if the music industry sits up, it could mean that that YouTube video above isn't quite as starry-eyed as we thought. Or perhaps i'm just a techno-optimist...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: RIN Team Blog \n \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      Cataloguing?

Do you need that many to describe any kind of asset? \n\nThis is where tagging differs dramatically from the much older art of cataloguing. With catalogues, the vocabulary is controlled, and carefully applied. There's a supply of finite keyword pick-lists: the Library of Congress Subject Headings, the Medical Subject Headings (MESH) or even the Dewey Decimal System. \n\nThe assumed knowledge was that without a way to account for the ambiguities of language and meaning, there is chaos.\n\nBut as Web experts adaptivepath put it: tagging throws that whole concept right out the window. An interesting thought - what would happen to a library if any librarian, frequent user, fleeting user, or one-off amateur was in control of the cataloguing?\n\nI imagine that you wouldn't be able to find a specific book, but you'd stumble across much more than you bargained for.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: RIN Team Blog | catalogue | internet \n \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      Visualising the Royal Society Archive of Papers\n\n    Posted by James Brown, 02 Feb 2007\n\n    \n\n\t\n\t\t0 comment\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAdd your views\n\t\t\n\t\t  \t\t\n \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tWhen the Royal Society recently provided an access to the archive of papers in their prestigious scientific journal, I bet they didn't foresee this...\n\nA man named Chris Harrison (who I can't seem to find any information on, aside from the fact that he is interested in ceramics, travel, motorbikes and computer science) has completed an extremely large timeline, depicting the archive of papers published in the journal from 1665 to 2005.\n\nThe visualisation displays papers chronologically, paper titles sorted alphabetically within a year. The size of the author's name reflects how prolific they were. Some interesting patterns emerge: \n\n\t\nPaper titles become shorter over time. \n\tThere is a notable decrease in the quantity of papers published per volume starting around 1761, which significantly rebounds in 1970. \n\tThere are numerous prolific authors in the 1700s, which are unmatched in any other time period. \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: RIN Team Blog \n \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      33 reasons why librarians are irreplacable\n\n    Posted by James Brown, 01 Feb 2007\n\n    \n\n\t\n\t\t0 comment\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAdd your views\n\t\t\n\t\t  \t\t\n \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t­\n\nFrom Phil Bradley's blog - there's an American website aimed at prospective college students talking about the \"existential crisis\" that librarians are facing at a time when they are perhaps needed the most. \n\nFrom the 33 listed reasons:\n\n1.

Representatives come mainly from the Netherlands, the UK and the US, there is representation also from Australia, the Czech Republic, Israel and Spain. JISC and SURF (its Netherlands counterpart) have been prominent among the organisations supporting the Group, and SURF hosts its website. Publisher involvement has been through the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP), the Emerald Group, and the American Physical Society.\n\n   \n\n  The Group has an ambitious mission, to develop and promote balanced approaches to rights management, with the aim of establishing maximum access to scholarly information. And early on it adopted a central objective and a series of principles to inform its work:\n\n   \n\n  Objective:\n\n   \n\n  To assist stakeholders – including authors, publishers, librarians, universities and the public – to achieve maximum access to scholarship without compromising quality or academic freedom and without denying aspects of costs and rewards involved.\n\n   \n\n  The Zwolle Principles: \n\n\tAchievement of this objective requires the optimal management of copyright in scholarly works to secure clear allocation of rights that balance the interests of all stakeholders.\n\n           \n\tOptimal management may be achieved through thoughtful development and implementation of policies, contracts, and other tools, as well as processes and educational programs, (collectively \"Copyright Management\") that articulate the allocation of rights and responsibilities with respect to scholarly works.\n\n           \n\tAppropriate Copyright Management and the interests of various stakeholders will vary according to numerous factors, including the nature of the work; for example, computer programs, journal articles, databases and multimedia instructional works may require different treatment.\n\n           \n\tIn the development of Copyright Management, the primary focus should be on the allocation to various stakeholders of specific rights.\n\n           \n\tCopyright Management should strive to respect the interests of all stakeholders involved in the use and management of scholarly works; those interests may at times diverge, but will in many cases coincide.\n\n           \n\tAll stakeholders in the management of the copyright in scholarly works have an interest in attaining the highest standards of quality, maximising current and future access, and ensuring preservation; stakeholders should work together on an international basis to best achieve these common goals and to develop a mutually supportive community of interest.\n\n           \n\tAll stakeholders should actively promote an understanding of the important implications of copyright management of scholarly work and encourage engagement with the development and implementation of Copyright Management tools to achieve the overarching objective. \n\n\n  Much of the work of the group has centred around copyright, and producing guidelines and a toolbox for authors and publishers seeking to develop new kinds of agreements for the publication of scholarly works; and there has been a major comparative analysis of copyright law as it affects scholarly publication in twelve different countries.\n\n   \n\n  Five years down the line, some valuable resources have been created. But it is not clear exactly where the project will go from here. Copyright remains a key issue in the continuing discussions and debates around the future of the scholarly communications process, and the changing roles of the key groups of players in that process. It seems unlikely that the last word has been said on these issues. But what further work needs to be done?\n\n   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: RIN Team Blog | intellectual property | journals | publishing | scholarly communications \n \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n« first‹ previous123456next ›last »\n \n     \n\t\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n  Tag Cloud\n\n\n  library \nEvent \nscholarly communications \ninternet \ndigital \ngovernment \npublishing \nsearch & discovery \ndata \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \tWhat do these Tags do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n  \n\n    \n     \n\n  Bookmark this page\n\n\n  \t\n\n- With Del.icio.us\n\t\n\n- With Connotea\n\n\n\t\n\nHow & why to use?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Who's online\n\n\n  There are currently 1 user and 14 guests online.Online users\n\tJames Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n  RIN.ac.uk | 2007     sitemap.     contact.     accessibility notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\tclose   [x]\n\t\n\t\tUsername\n\n\t\tPassword\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\nyour browser is not enabled to support javascript\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n",
