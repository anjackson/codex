Ers y perfformiad cyntaâ yn Galaway yn 1996, mae The Beauty Queen of Leenane wedi cael rhediad hir yn Llundain, yn ogystal ag ennill pedair gwobr âTonyâ yn Efrog Newydd. Amser a ddengys a fydd cynhyrchiad Cwmni Theatr Gwynedd o gyfieithiad Huw Roberts yn ennill yr un clod. Y clod mwyaâ iâr Cwmni fyddai theatr lawn.\n\tLleolir y ddrama yn gadarn iawn mewn pentra bach gwledig yn ardal Connemara, ac maeâr elfenna hanfodol Wyddelig yn amlwg iawn. Yn wir, gall rhywun ddeall pam fod rhai o drigolion Gorllewin Iwerddon wedi gwrth-wynebuâr elfennau ystrydebol syân brithioâr ddrama. Ar y llaw arall, mae Leenane hefyd yn hogan unrhywle. Mae elfenna fel diboblogi cefn gwlad oherwydd diffyg cyfle, glastwreiddio iaith frodorol gan y diwylliant Eingl-Awstraliaidd/Americanaidd, sydd hefyd yn hynod berthnasol i Gymru.\n\tOnd i mi, rhagoriaeth y ddrama yma ydy ei bod hiân gweithio ar lefel bersonol. Feâch llusgir i mewn iâr gegin fach dywyll syân edrych dros y buarth mwdlyd lle maeâr ieir yn pigo, i ogleuo pisoâr fam wrth iddi wagio cynnwys ei phot i lawr sinc y gegin bob bora. Bron nad ydach chiân gallu blasu powdwr y âComplanâ syân cael ei stwffioân rwgnachlyd dan drwyn y fam pob pryd bwyd. Rhyw âGomplanâ o fodolaeth di-liw sydd gan y fam aâr ferch, gyda lympia tragywydd o chwerwder nad oes posib cael gwared Ã¢ nhw.\n\tYn syth wedi iâr golau godi ar y set, feâch tynnir  i fewn iâr cecru aâr chwerwder sydd wedi tyfu fel tamprwydd drwy berthynas Maureen Folan (Rhian Cadwaladr) aâi mam Mag (Valmai Jones). Maeâr set yn syml; cegin/stafell fyw Maureen aâi mam Mag sydd yno drwy gydol y ddrama, yn cyfleu bodolaeth clawstroffobig y ddwy. Pedwar cymeriad syân ymddangos i gyd, a does âna ddim giamocs efo gwsgoedd syân gofyn i chi ddal eich anghredinedd yn Ã´l a dychmygu mwy o gymeriadau naâr pedwar yma. Drama gignoeth real yw Dynes Ddela Leenane, a daw gweddill y âbyd tu allan iâr drwsâ yn fyw drwy glyfrwch deialog, ac yn ffurf y set deledu aâr set radio syân bresenoldebau ffyddlon drwyâr cwbwl. Mae âna efallai bumed cymeriad haniaethol, sef y âDdynes Ddelaâ syân bodoli ym mhen Maureen Dolway, yr hyn y gallasai hi fod wedi bod.\n\tMae hon yn ddrama syml, glasurol: stori hen ferch chwerw sy wedi cael ei chaethiwo yn y t_ yn edrych ar Ã´l ei Mam syân âglaf di-glefydâ fel maeân cael ei disgrifio. Does dim byd ysgytwol o syfrdanol yn y plot. Mae âna elfennau disgwyliadwy: y dyn, Pato Dooley (Dewi Rhys) syân dal cannwyll i Maureen Folan ac yn cynnig allwedd iddi ddianc a  dechraâ bywyd newydd. Acsis cynllun y ddrama ydy llythr syân cael ei agor gan y fam a sydd byth yn cyrraedd y ferch. Ac mae âna rywbeth pleserus iawn rywffordd mewn gwylioâr dÃ©nouement. Yn ei hanfod, maeâr ddrama yn gorwedd yn yr hafn rhwng disgwyliadau fregus Maureen aâr ffordd mae pobl a Ffawd yn cynllwynio i siomiâr disgwyliadau hynny. O safbwynt hynny, rydan niân bendant yn nhiriogaeth Aristotlys aâi gorws.\n\tOnd yn gynnar iawn yn y ddrama, rydan niân sylweddoli mai âdrama llofft capalâ efo rhyw dro macÃ¢br yn ei chynffon ydy hon. Nid gwylio stori bach gyffredin yn dad-wau ei hun oân blaenaâ wnawn i yma. Feân teflir i mewn yn syth iâr bregetan cas rhwng y fam aâr ferch, cyn ein bod wedi dechraâ cynhesuân seti. Nid dod i mewn ar ddechraâ dirywiad y ddwy wnawn ni yma, ond ârydan niân ei chanol hiân barod.\n\tCefais yn teimlad od oedd ytn ymylu ar embaras am funudau, fel petawn iân  gwrando ar ffrae deuluol rhywun arall, a ddim yn si_r a ddylech chi chwerthin ta edrych i ffwrdd ac esgus eich bod chi ddim wedi sylwi. Roedd hyn, am wn i, am nad oeddwn i wedi cael cyfle i ddod i adnabod y cymeriada cyn iâr ffrae ddechraâ. Ac eto, yr oedd y profiad clustfeiniol yma yn sicrhau ein chwilfrydedd aân diddordeb oâr cychwyn. Mae adwaith eithafol a threisgar Maureen iâr ffaith fod ei Mam wedi difetha ei chyfle am hapusrwydd yn gredadwy yn y cyd-destun hwn. \n\tHonna Martin McDonagh fod cynhyrchwyr ffilm fel David Lynch a Quentin Tarantino wedi cael dylanwad arno wrth sgwennu. Mae natur a graddfaâr trais aâr defnydd o ryw fel cyfrwng i wawdio yn lled atgoffaol oâr gweithiau tywyll fel Natural Born Killers a Reservoir Dogs. Ond, wrth gwrs, maeâr ffaith ei fod yn digwydd yn fyw, ar lwyfan theatr, yn ei wneud yn fwy anesmwyth, yn cael effaith mwy ingol nag a fuasai ar sgrÃ®n. Fuâr defnydd o hiwmor du erioed yn fwy derbyniol nag yma. Eto, rywsut, wrth chwerthin ar eiriaâ dilornus a milain y naill at y llall, rydan ninnauân cael ein tynnu i mewn iâr cÃ´d moesol gwyrdroÃ«dig sydd iâw weld yn dderbyniol bron o fewn byd y ddrama.\n\tY cymeriadaâ syân achos i hon godi uwchlawâr cyffredin; maen nhw i gyd yn gwbwl gredadwy, yn gymeriadau stoc syân gig a gwaed ar yr un pryd. Rhaid rhoi clod i bob aelod oâr cast am borteadau hynod gynhyrfus, o Rhian Cadwaladr fel yr hen ferch chwerw, Valmai Jones syân pefrio fel y fam hunanol rwgnachlyd, i Dewi Rhys fel y Pato Dooley diffuant, boneddigaidd. Mae Owen Arwyn fel Ray Dooley yn serennu i mi fel y llefnyn syân fflewtian i mewn yn ei siaced denim, yn brithioâi eiriaâ efo idiomau Eingl-Americanaidd ac wastad ar frys i fod yn unrhywle âblaw yn nh_ Maureen a Mag. Er mai yn y Saesneg yr oedd y ddrama wreiddiol, bwriad yr awdur yw awgrymu mai Gwyddeleg maen nhwân siarad ond ei bod yn araf ildio iâr Saesneg. Ray Dooley syân cynrychioliâr colli tir ieithyddol yn y fersiwn Gymraeg ac maeân gyfrwng effeithiol i wneud hynny. Mae cyfieithiad Huw Roberts drwyddo draw yn slic a chyhyrog.\n\tYng nghud-destun fframwaith real y ddrama, maeâr awgrym ar y diwedd mai rhith oedd ffarweliad rhamantus Maureen efo Pato ar y trÃªn, yn gorwedd braidd yn anghyfforddus fel ffordd i ddiweddaruâr ddrama. Wrth gnoi cil hefyd yn oerniâr car ar y ffordd adra, fedrwn i ddim peidio teimlo y byddaiâr ddrama ar ei hennill o gael bwa naratif cryfach; er mwyn inni fedru gweld elfen o ddirywiad ym mherthynas Mam a merch, fel bod âna arlliw o gynhesrwydd cyn i bethau gyrraedd penllanwâr rhwystredigaeth yn llofruddiaeth y fam.\n\tApwyntiwyd Ian Rowlands yn Gyfarwyddwr Artistig yn Theatr Gwynedd yn ogystal Ã¢ chwaraeâr un rÃ´l i Bara Caws. Fo hefyd sydd wedi cyfarwyddo Leenane a chynhyrchiad Bara Caws o Bingo gan SiÃ¢n Summers. Yn y rhagair i raglen y ddrama, maeân nodi mai ei brif ffocws fel cyfarwyddwr artistig âfydd ail-adeiladuâr gynulleidfa ar gyfer y theatr Gymraeg.â Mewn cyfnod anodd yn hanes Theatr Gwynedd, maeâr cynhyrchiad hwn yn si_r o danlinellu gwerth a chyfraniad Cwmni Theatr Gwynedd iâr tirlun theatrig yng Nghymru.

She left Croatia when the late president of that state, Franjo Tudjman, declared his country to be “paradise on earth”. She was also targeted by the ultra-nationalist Croatian press and described as a “witch” for having the temerity to question her country’s values.\n\nUgresic, who writes both fiction and prose, is one of those authors who has earned the unwanted title of being “one of the best writers you have never heard of”. Her collections of essays The Culture of Lies and Thank You For Not Reading are must-reads for anyone with an interest in seeing European and western culture (they are not the same) from an original perspective. Nobody’s Home (Telegram) is her latest collection of essays in which she continues those investigations. It is a work full of wondrous, intelligent and provocative insights. She writes about identity, nationalism, communism, city life, feminism and religion in a voice which is both conversational and critical.\n\nUgresic is the product of Tito’s Yugoslavia and her world view is coloured accordingly. (We have had Stalinist and Maoist writers but Ugresic may be the first Titoist, though I should use a lower case “t”; she is slave to no one.) That is not to say that she laments the passing of the political system in the former Yugoslavia but rather a certain kind of comradeship which glued the state together.\n\nThe new nationalism in the region brings with it a flood of chancers and charlatans: “The leaders of the change were fierce nationalists, even though they had been communists before. Former anti-fascists became brand new fascists, atheists became passionate believers, murderers became heroes, thugs and thieves became prosperous businessmen, and ignoramuses became arrogant public thinkers.” (Is any of this familiar?)\n\nShe writes of the way in which the break-up of the country resulted in history being rewritten. Fascists who fought with the Nazis and who were persona non grata under Tito have been rehabilitated and are now heroes. The communist partisans who fought Hitler are now cast aside with contempt. The language of the former Yugoslavia was recognisably one single tongue. No longer. Croats and Serbs exaggerate and manufacture linguistic differences to ensure that they have ‘their’ own separate, sacred language. (Is any of this familiar?)\n\nShe visits the prison of Goli Otok where Tito held Yugoslavs he suspected of being pro-Stalinist. Ugresic is part of a tour group and, on the day of their arrival, a porn shoot is in full swing. One visitor complains to the ‘star’ of the shoot that she is “making porn movies in a place where the bones of sufferers are buried”. The actress replies: “Not porn, art!” (Perhaps we have discovered a use for the Maze?)\n\nNobody’s Home is full of these little moments when history and reality collide together in a surreal crash of ideas, indignation and imagination. Nothing is sacred: “Everyone can and usually does extract a profit from the past. Except the victims.” (Is any of this familiar?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nPÃ³l Ã“ MuirÃ­\n\n\nat\n9:17 AM\n\n\n1 comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLabels:\nAmsterdam,\nCroatia,\nCulture of Lies and Thank You For Not Reading,\nDubravka Ugresic,\nFranjo Tudjman,\nGoli Otok,\nNobody’s Home,\nTito,\nYugoslavia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\nNewer Posts\n\n\nOlder Posts\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to:\nPosts (Atom)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEl Blogador is a web log based in Ireland focussing on Irish nationalism and social democracy.

With the deliberate focus on reaching a young audience the second Monday in March was selected as one when all Commonwealth children would be in school. So 1977 marked the first simultaneous observance day across all the Commonwealth. \nOver the past 30 years the day has been an opportunity to learn and explore both the history of our association as well as current concerns that are common to us all. \nThe Archives and the Library of the Commonwealth Secretariat hold the records of these discussions, plus mementos and other related resources. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tImages\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\nInvitation to the Secretary Generalâs Reception 11 June 1976.

Photo: Idil Sukan\n\n\nElla Hickson???s second play has been considerably reworked since it first appeared at the Bedlam Theatre at the 2009 Edinburgh Fringe. The premise remains the same but certain scenes have been strengthened and lengthened since that first showing, certain points clarified.\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\nHickson???s three-hander begins on a New York rooftop on Christmas Eve.?? This is where Sam, nineteen and bursting with adolescent chutzpah, first meets Joey, the English girl in New York, flight-frazzled and fidgety in a new city. One thing leads to another and they end up dashing through the New York night, wrapped in each other???s arms beneath the chandeliers of Grand Central Station. These opening moments, with their faintly unreal, US indie movie quality ? Linklater-lite ? are revisited later in the play and amusingly undermined.\n\nJoey, it transpires, is in New York to visit the father she hasn???t seen in more than two years. Having recently lost her job and feeling increasingly uncomfortable at home following her mother?s remarriage, she is trying to build bridges. George, her father, a retired academic, has allowed the ties between them to slacken because he wants to shield her from his own mental and physical unravelling.\n\nJoey is yet to discover this; she also initially does not realise that Sam, the boy with whom she shared her rooftop liaison, is also her father???s carer. The play turns its attention on the relationships between these three people who are so intimately connected ??? father and daughter; patient and carer ??? and yet distanced from one another, emotionally, culturally.\n\nThe character of Sam has benefited most from the reworking of the play. He retains his blithe American optimism and his certainty about how the world works, but there are greater hints at the things that drive him and these are drawn out by Anthony Walsh???s confident performance in the role.??Ian Gelder also gives a measured and moving performance as George, a man all too aware of his own deterioration; his life has been one of the mind and now he is losing his hold on himself and the things he loves.\n\nJoey is, oddly, the weakest point of the triangle. Her own struggle to gain a sense of her place in the world has lost some of its freshness; the play, on first viewing, gave a strong sense of what it meant to become an adult just as the rules about what exactly that means ? in terms of career and security, in terms of the future ? seem to be shifting dramatically. Yet this seems to have been diluted a little in the re-writes (or maybe it?s just that I have grown a little older, lived a little more).?? Sam???s kind manner and puppyish enthusiasm now seem to jar more with Joey???s capacity for child-like outbursts. Though the character of Joey as written gives a good account of what it is to be perched between adolescence and adulthood, Olivia Hallinan???s performance veers more towards the former. While her brittleness occasionally comes across as brattish, there is a measure of poignancy in her sudden need for her father???s reassurance, in her wish to recreate a proper English Christmas, just like the Christmases of her childhood. As a generational mouthpiece she?s on shaky ground but the character succeeds as a portrait of a confused, if rather self-involved, girl who suddenly feels at sea in the world and misses her dad.\n\nWith a longer running time, this reworking of the play is able to better flesh out all three relationships and allows for a more playful, plausible sense of attraction between Joey and Sam. The relationship between George and Joey, volatile but fuelled by love, is also elegantly portrayed in James Dacre?s new production and George???s monologue, in which he acknowledges all he stands to lose, is particularly moving (aided by Hickson???s sense of the poetic). That said, the culture clash humour can feel overplayed at times, an easy recourse rather than a source of real insight, and the final coda strikes a rather hollow note. The sheen of Washington D.C. on inauguration day and the way it feeds Joey?s need to belong to a moment, to be part of a movement, to just connect with something, all seems a trifle too neat a way to end a play that is otherwise brighter and sharper than that.\n\nRead the Exeunt interview with Ella Hickson.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\n\t\t\t\t Related Reviews\n\n\t\t\t\t \tThe Animals and Children Took To The Streets.

Schumacher.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA space to share skills, learn about technologies, create networks, develop ideas and be inspired about international development and the planet.\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tThe first Small is… Festival in 2009 was a great success and the second in 2010 saw the festival's popularity substancially grow. Due to popular demand, the Small is... Festival is back for a third year and will be held from the 2nd to the 4th September 2011.\n\n\n\tThis year's event will be full of fun and learning with lively networking and exchange sessions, open debates, hands-on workshops, stalls and information sharing spaces, kids activities and great world music, topped off with local food and hospitality. There will certainly be something for everyone!\n\n\n\tIf you came last year we hope to see you again.\n\n\n\tIf you didn’t make it last year, check out the pictures and stories on the site and you’ll soon get a feel for what is a really unique event.\n\n\n\tThe event is held in the beautiful Warwickshire countryside in the grounds of international development charity Practical Action. \n\n\n\tWhether you would like to camp or just visit for the day, tickets are limited so get in quick!\n\n\n\tAlso get in touch if you would like to be a contributor, sharing skills in a workshop, having a stall to explain your organisations or products, or being part of a themed networking and exchange session. We are also open to applications for helpers to be part of the enthusiastic crew of people who help make the festival happen on the day and in the run up to the event.\n\n\n\tEverything you need to learn about the festival and get involved should be on this site, but if you have any other questions or queries, please don’t hesitate to get in touch with us on small_is@practicalaction.org.uk or call on 01926 634 518.\n\n\n\tWe're looking forward to seeing you in September for what we hope will be a life-changing experience.\n\n\n\tThe Small is… Festival team\n\n\nno comments\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCan't find what you're looking for?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTell us who you are\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLet us know which of the options below best describes you and we'll direct you to the most relevant content.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nDevelopment practitioner\nInternational body\nTrust and foundation\nMP and MEP\nPress and media\nTeacher\nSupporter\n\n\nGo\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat we do\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPractical Action uses technology to challenge poverty, working with poor women and men around the world.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our work by Country\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\nBangladesh\nEast Africa\nLatin America\nNepal\nSouth Asia\nSouthern Africa\nSudan\nUnited Kingdom\n\n\nGo\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our work by Technology\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\nEnergy\nFood and agriculture\nDisaster risk reduction\nTransport\nWater and sanitation\nClimate change\nMarkets\nNew technologies\nWaste management\nInfrastructure\nReconstruction\nUrban poverty\n\n\nGo\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDonate to support our work\n\tTake action in a campaign\n\tBuy a Practical Present\n\tFollow us on twitter\n\tJoin us on Facebook\n\tSign up to our newsletter\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPractical Action,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Schumacher Centre,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBourton on Dunsmore,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRugby, CV23 9QZ, UK\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReg Charity No 247257\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t+44 (0)1926 634400\t\t\t\t\t\tpracticalaction@practicalaction.org.uk\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t© Practical Action\n\n\t\t\t\t\tContact us\n\tPrivacy policy\n\tSite map\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n",

a contact lens with hanging crystals.\n\nCore77 - naming Dutch website Domus as its source - described the invention as being as close to eye design as it can get - apart from having surgery.\n\nWhile some people could find the concept of wearing crystals hanging from a contact lens a little cringe worthy, others may jump at the chance to own a pair of these innovative accessories.\n\nThey have been five years in development by designer Eric Klarenbeek and could be marketed within months, the website said.\n\n\"One of the boldest ideas in jewellery design is now undergoing tests and certification,\" it added.\n\nA photograph included on the website showed a string of crystals appearing to hang from the eyeball itself.\n\nFor fashionistas who like to use snazzy contact lenses but do not fancy this type of design, coloured contact lenses are also available to order online and can also be made to a prescription.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<< Back to list\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n  Contact Lens News Sections\n\n\n  \n    \n\n      \tCelebrity & fashion contact lenses news\n\tContact lenses sporting news\n\tContact lens Safety news\n\tContact lenses research & development news\n\tGeneral Eye news\n\tContact lens manufacturer news\n\tContact Lens Solution News\n\tLaser Eye Surgery news\n\tChildren & kids contact lenses news\n\n\n\n      \nNews Archive    Our writers\n\n      \n\n      \n      \n      \n\n      \n\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  Featured articles\n\n  \n  \n\n  New technique could tackle eye damage\nEye damage and optical disease could be targeted thanks to a new form of therapy developed by experts in the US. read more\n\nA cure for blindness is now a step closer\nA new study has revealed that a type of gene therapy may be able to reverse the effects of congenital blindness. read more\n\nNew devices to make life easier for visually impaired\nA new range of devices from VTT will help to make the everyday lives of visually impaired people easier, it has been claimed. read more\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n\n  \n    \n      © 2012 Contactlenses Ltd, All Rights Reserved\n\n      Sitemap | Contact us|\n\n      \n    \n\n      Find us in:\n\n      USA | Canada | Australia | Germany | Italy | France | Spain | India\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n",

Well, today we?re celebrating two milestones.\n\n\nOver the weekend we got our 10,000th member here in the forums. Thanks to all for contributing! I'm amazed at how fast it's grown since we launched in November, and how useful it's been both for our users (to get help) and us (to find out how we can serve you better).\n\nAlso, we passed our 10,000th download of our new WordPress plug-in (since its launch in December). To celebrate we released an update that supports our latest lightbox-style More menu and finer display control (at last, you can just add a simple CSS rule to affect the button uniformly).\n\nThanks for your support! Please do continue to post here with your ideas, questions, and criticism. We really appreciate it.\n\nBest,\nMatt\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\nEngineering Director, AddThis\ne: matt@addthis.com\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTop\t? ?\n ?\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tmjk\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t?Post subject: Re: 10,000 strong!\nPosted: Tue Oct 27, 2009 12:45 pm?\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAddThis Employee\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJoined: Wed Nov 19, 2008 4:30 pm\nPosts: 1950\nLocation: Brooklyn, NY\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHow time flies.

ARTICLES\nEMBLEMS AND HEIRLOOMS.\nRESTITUTION, REPARATION, AND THE\nSUBJECTIVE VALUE OF CHATTELS:\nA LEGAL PERSPECTIVE\nNORMAN PALMER\nPeople need to have a past, because it provides a sense of security,\nroots; it imparts self-worth, identity. We don?t notice it when it is\nthere, we consider it a matter of course, but it is not. Children contin-\nue to look throughout their lifetime for the father or mother they have\nnever known simply because they need to know where they come\nfrom. They will go to any lengths. Adopted children travel back to the\ncountry where they were born. Where there is a past, there is a\n1\nfuture.\nIntroduction: The Intangible Dimensions of Tangible Things\nTangible objects come in many guises. Some draw their value from\nsubjective association alone. The plainest thing is precious when it\nhas personal meaning. A letter or a photograph, a wedding ring, a\nchild?s tooth, even a seaside souvenir, can revive memories and in -\nspire joy or grief. The loss of such an item can be bitterly mourned.\nSuch things rarely have commercial appeal. They seldom appear\nat auction or in museums. Nor do they possess that ineffable mys-\nThe author thanks Kate Hawken and Ji-Shuen Loong for editorial assistance\nin producing this article.\n1\nJ. P. Sigmond, ?Some Thoughts on the Importance of Cultural Heritage and\nthe Protection of Cultural Goods?, Art, Antiquity and Law, 10 (2005), 63?71, at\n67, paraphrasing David Lowenthal, The Past is a Foreign Country (Cam bridge,\n1986). \n8Emblems and Heirlooms\n2\ntique that attaches to great art. Their value lies in their subjective or\nsymbolic resonance. They are cherished because they enshrine mem-\nories and form part of a person?s identity or make-up. They may be\nthe only surviving trace of a family?s history. They may even sum up\na whole life.\nThe vitality of such an object may be unknown to anyone other\nthan the person who senses it. A fictional example is the child?s sled\n?Rosebud?, the name of which was on Charles Foster Kane?s lips as he\ndied. The word recalled a childhood loss, still poignant to a dying\nman some sixty years on. Only he recalled the day when, as a child,\nhe was parted from his family, and his plaything was taken from\nhim. The secret of its meaning died with him. In that case, as in so\nmany, a humdrum chattel represented a lost life and a lost world.\nIn no context, perhaps, can this symbolism be more potent or\npoignant than that of chattels owned by families scattered and rav-\naged by the Holocaust. In such a case the object may be the sole tan-\ngible reminder of a life irretrievably erased or scarred by murder,\n3\npersecution, or displacement: ?a bridge back to a world destroyed.?\nIt is hard to imagine a more poignant tale of symbolic association\nthan that of the suitcase, discovered by Mr Michel Levi-Leleu in 2005\n2\nThe nature of art has engaged the attention of philosophers as well as\njurists. Prominent critics in this regard are Immanuel Kant and Leo Tolstoy:\nsee the latter?s What is Art? trans. Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky\n(London, 1995). Professor Stephen Guest has suggested in ?The Value of Art?,\nArt, Antiquity and Law, 7 (2002), 305?16, at 307 that the value of art ?is to be\nfound in the value of its own existence, independent of its doing anything for\nus. We admire art because of this independent value, and so admire it as ?art\nfor art?s sake?. Looking at art this way introduces us to art?s austere quality,\nthrough which we respect art, not for anything it ?does? for us, but because\nunderstanding it properly requires understanding something of importance,\nperhaps great importance about the world. And so we say that we want to\nlook at a painting by Van Gogh because it is wonderful, not that it is wonder-\nful because we want to look at it. This way of looking at art borrows from the\ngreat German philosopher Kant, who not only asserted art?s independent\nvalue, but took the point even further. The appreciation of art, he thought,\nwas akin to moral appreciation and capable of expressing our highest aspi-\nrations.?\n3\nThe phrase is that of Edward Serotta, ?Preserving Jewish Memory?, The\nLibrary of Rescued Memories: Pictures and Stories from the Centropa Interviews in\nthe Czech Republic (Vienna, 2009), 14?16, at 14.\n9Articles\nat an exhibition at the Shoah Memorial Museum in Paris where it had\narrived on loan from the collections of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State\nMuseum in Oswiecim. He claimed that the suitcase had belonged to\nhis father Pierre Levi, who was murdered at Auschwitz and whose\nname and address (?86 Boul, Villette, Paris Pierre Levi?) were in scrib -\ned on a tag attached to the object. To many, the argument for restitu-\ntion was compelling: principles of property, inheritance, tradition,\nand the redress of wrongdoing collectively appealed for the return of\nthe thing to Pierre Levi?s descendants. But even so graphic an in -\nstance of subjective association embodied more complex values. The\nAuschwitz-Birkenau Museum resisted the return to the family on the\nground that the suitcase no longer symbolized the experience of a\nsingle family alone. It had taken on a new character as a metaphor of\nthe panoply of wrongs committed against the Jewish population of\nEurope in the years 1933 to 1945. Thus interpreted, the suitcase had a\npart to play in the transcendent imperative to ensure that those evils\n4\nwere never forgotten.\nOf course the history or hinterland of an everyday thing may\nincrease its monetary worth. Ordinary things intersect with great\npeople or great events. We are accustomed to see inherently mun-\ndane articles achieve high prices because they once belonged to\nsomebody famous or reflect some historic occasion. The ?royal or\nromantic? association of an item of jewellery, we are told, may great-\n4\nIn the words of the Press Release, issued when the claim was settled in 2009:\n?The International Auschwitz Council . . . contended that everything left\nfrom the camp should remain inviolate and integral . . . The suitcases belong-\ning to people deported to Auschwitz are among the most priceless material\ntestimony to the tragedy that occurred here. They constitute a small remain-\nder of the property left behind by the victims of the gas chambers, and the\nnames on some of them are among the few proofs of the death of specific\nindividuals in Auschwitz . . . [T]he Auschwitz Museum . . . regards the suit-\ncase as one of the rare objects symbolizing and representing the memory of\nthe persons deported to the camp, and . . . wishes to express the deepest\nunderstanding of the emotions of the families of Shoah victims.? Under the\nsettlement, the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum decided to leave the suitcase in\nthe Paris Shoah museum on a long-term basis. Mr Levi-Leleu?s family, in\nturn, renounced its claims. See ?Settlement reached over Auschwitz\nSuitcases? in the News 2009 section of Memorial and Museum: Auschwitz-\nBirkenau <en.auschwitz.org/m/index.php?option=com_content&task>, ac -\ncess ed 28 Feb. 2012.\n10Emblems and Heirlooms\n5\nly increase its desirability to investors and connoisseurs. Earlier this\ncentury, the bullet-pierced windscreen of the Austro-Daimler in\nwhich the Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his morganatic wife the\nCountess Sophie Chotek were murdered at Sarajevo was consigned\nfor auction at an estimated 2,300 euros, though ?it probably sold for\n6\nconsiderably more?. Objects associated with Adolf Hitler may be a\nmacabre and tainted class of memorabilia, but the market for them is\n7\nby no means stagnant.\nConverting celebrity value into money is an elusive enterprise.\nSuch value can, however, be objectively verified, whether through\ncompetitive bidding at auction or other professional processes. By\ncontrast, the more private and personal items that reflect a lost child-\nhood or family may have no commercial worth at all, or at least none\nworth litigating over. In general, they are unlikely to find their way\ninto a museum. Even if they do enter a museum their commercial\nworth remains low. Their value lies in their memories, and those\nmemories may be secret.\nOne aim of this article is to evaluate the relative importance of\nsuch subjective association in the eyes of the law. The article consid-\ners the question both in the general context of personal property and\nthrough the specific prism of Holocaust-related objects. It seeks to\ninquire how far our approach to the restitution of Holocaust materi-\nal reflects and respects the unique subjective value of individual\nobjects to specific claimants, whether these are individuals, families,\nor nations.\nGeneral Litigation Surrounding Personal Chattels\nPersonal Objects: Does the Law Endow them with Special Value?\nThe common law of England is not a sentimental institution. One can\ncite numerous cases where judges have subordinated individual jus-\n5\nJabir v. H Jordan & Co (unreported, 13 Dec. 2010) upheld by the Court of\nAppeal [2011] EWCA Civ 816.\n6\nSigmond, ?Some Thoughts on the Importance of Cultural Heritage?, 65.\n7\nFor recent instances of proposed sales of such material, see ?Auction Row\nover Hitler Desk Set on which the Munich Pact was Signed?, Daily Telegraph,\n15 Nov. 2011; ?Hitler?s Sheet to be Sold?, The Times, 24 Nov. 2011.\n11Articles\n8\ntice to the relentless dictates of legal principle. But the law is not\nwithout compassion in the context of human relationships with chat-\ntels. For example, when granting compensation for the violation of a\nchattel (typically by theft, damage, or unlawful detention) modern\ncourts sometimes pay regard to an individual?s personal association\n9\nwith that chattel. Where damages are sought against the wrongdoer\n10\nthe sum awarded may thus exceed the market worth of the object.\nA recurrent medium for such awards is litigation over pet ani-\nmals. Older case law was reluctant to award more than the objective\nvalue of a family pet. In Tasmania in 1927, for example, the Supreme\nCourt awarded a mere ?2 Australian for the loss of a pet cat that had\n11\nbeen unlawfully shot by a neighbour. Later authority seems more\nwilling to accept that the owner?s loss may include an element of\nquantifiable subjective value. In Canada, damages to reflect an\nowner?s sentimental attachment to a cherished pet have been award-\ned against an airline through whose default one dog was killed and\n8\ne.g. Mr Justice Littledale in Balme v Hutton (1833) 9 Bing. 471 at 507: ?I think\nthe hardship of a case ought not to form a principle on which the law should\nact. Society is so formed, that many people fill relations which appear to\ninduce great hardships. If these hardships be of sufficient importance for the\nlegislature to interfere, they will do so.? In the same case at 512 Mr Justice\nPark said: ?The hardship . . . can be no argument if the law be clear . . . the\nCourt must be governed by the principles of law, and not by the hardship of\nany particular case.? See also, among numerous similar remarks, those of Mr\nJustice Patteson and Baron Alderson in Garland v Carlisle (1837) 4 Cl & Fin 693\nat 740?1 and 747 respectively. These and other cases are discussed in Nor -\nman Palmer and Ruth Redmond-Cooper (eds.), Taking it Personally: The\nIndividual Liability of Museum Personnel (Builth Wells: Institute of Art and\nLaw, 2011).\n9\nSometimes they will also inquire whether the violation was vindictive as\nopposed to inadvertent. This may affect liability and/or the damages award-\ned. For an early case see Whittingham v Ideson (1861) 8 Upp Can LJ 14;\nNorman Palmer and Anthony Hudson, ?Damages for Distress and Loss of\nEnjoyment in Claims involving Chattels?, in Norman Palmer and Evan\nMcKendrick (eds.), Interests in Goods (2nd edn. London, 1998), ch. 34, 867?95,\nat 882 n.98. \n10\nFor a detailed older analysis of Commonwealth and US case law in this\nfield, see ibid. ch. 34.\n11\nDavies v Bennison [1927] Tas LR 52.\n12Emblems and Heirlooms\n12\nanother severely injured, or a boarding kennel that allowed a dog\n13\nto escape, from which adventure it never returned. The latter case\nwas cited with approval in a controversial recent decision in an\nEnglish immigration appeal about an asylum seeker who relied on\nhis acquisition of a cat in England as evidence that he had put down\n14\nroots in England and developed a family life.\nSuch awards remain rare and one should be wary of overstating\n15\nthem. Moreover, they are generally modest in quantum. But a com-\nparable logic is reflected in cases about inanimate chattels. It has, for\nexample, been held reasonable for the owner of a car to which the\nowner attached exceptional sentimental importance, and on which\nhe had lavished exceptional attention over the period of his owner-\nship, to spend a greater sum in reinstating the car to its former con-\ndition after it was negligently damaged than the amount of its result-\nant market value. Where the owner of a much-loved MG car named\n?Mademoiselle Hortensia? spent a substantial sum in having the car\nrepaired following its damage through the collapse of scaffolding, he\nwas allowed to recover that sum against the scaffolding company\nwhose negligence had led to the damage. The claim succeeded des -\n12\nNewell v Canadian Pacific Airlines Ltd (1976) 14 OR (2d) 752; and see Watt v\nLogan (1945) 61 Sh Ct Rep 155 at 158.\n13\nFerguson and Hagans v Birchmount Boarding Kennels Ltd and Robert Jones and\nBert Barrett (2006) 79 OR 681; and see Borza v Banner (1975) 60 DLR (3d) 604;\nSomerville v Malloy [1999] OJ No 428.\n14\nDecision of Immigration Judge Mr J. R. Devittie at para 15: ?The evidence\nconcerning the joint acquisition of Maya [the cat] by the appellant and his\npartner reinforces my conclusion on the strength and quality of family life\nthat the appellant and his partner enjoy . . . The Canadian courts have moved\naway from the legal view that animals are merely chattels, to a recognition\nthat they play an important part in the lives of their owners and that the loss\nof a pet has a significant impact on its owner.?\n15\nIn other contexts the amount of an award for personal anguish caused by\na defendant?s wrongdoing can be substantial. A vivid example in the field of\ncultural property is the award of 80,000 NIS for the personal anguish caused\nto the scholar Elisha Qimron by the violation of his copyright and moral right\nrelating to the defendants? publication of the ?Deciphered Text? produced\nfrom the Hidden Scrolls (or Dead Sea Scrolls): Eisenman v Qimron; Shanks,\nRobinson and the Biblical Archaeological Society v Qimron (29 Aug. 2000), a deci-\nsion of the Supreme Court of Israel sitting as the Appellate Court for Civil\nAppeals.\n13Articles\npite the defendant?s argument that the car was beyond economic re -\npair and the proper result would have been to write the car off and\n16\nallow the owner its market value immediately before the damage.\nMr Justice Edmund Davies observed that the claimant had owned\nthe car for thirteen years, had devoted himself to its care and main-\ntenance over that time, and clearly believed that ?there was no other\ncar like it?. These factors entitled the claimant to recover the greater\ncost of repairing the car, unless it was unreasonable for him to pur-\nsue that course as opposed to replacing it. The burden of proving that\nrepair was an unreasonable option lay on the defendant and the\n17\ndefendant had not discharged it.\n18\nOther cases are in line with this approach. The loss of a rosary\nthrough the defendant?s want of due care resulted in damages to rep-\n19\nresent its sentimental value. The negligent loss of a long-standing\nstamp and glass collection built up almost from childhood led to an\naward of damages to represent the owner?s distress and injured feel-\n20\nings.\nCompared to the ravages suffered by Holocaust victims these\ncases may seem trivial, but that, in a sense, is the point. If the law is\nprepared to award damages for the personal hurt suffered through\nthe loss of a treasured thing in conditions that fall infinitely short of\nthe terrors of the Holocaust, it could hardly object in principle to a\nsubjective measure of compensation for an owner whose whole fam-\nily or way of life had been destroyed.\n16\nO?Grady v Westminster Scaffolding [1962] 2 Lloyds Rep 238: Palmer and\nHudson, ?Damages for Distress?, 889?90. And see Scobie v Wing (1992) 2\nWWR 514; Palmer and Hudson, ?Damages for Distress?, 892?4.\n17\nAs to the general requirement that damages founded on the cost of rein-\nstatement (as opposed to diminution in value) must be reasonable in order\nto be recoverable, see Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth [1996]\nAC 344 (swimming pool) and the archive case of Aerospace Publishing Ltd v\nThames Water Utilities Ltd [2007] EWCA Civ 3, below p. 17. \n18\ne.g. Piper v Darling (1940) 67 LL L Rep 419 at 423 per Mr Justice Langton\n(damages reflecting an ?element of sentiment and predilection? in regard to a\nnegligently damaged yacht); Palmer and Hudson ?Damages for Distress?, 877\nn. 70.\n19 th\nZien v Queen (1984) 20 DLR (4 ) 283 at 294?5.\n20\nGraham v Voight (1989) 95 FLR 146; and see Norman Palmer (ed.), Palmer\non Bailment (3rd edn. London, 2009), para 37-046.\n14Emblems and Heirlooms\nAgain, however, such cases should be approached with caution.\n21\nThere are decisions on the other side of the line, though mainly of\n22\nan older vintage. The leading case on damages for disappointment\n23\ninvolved a claim for breach of contract, and says nothing about the\nsort of liability that might arise, for example, in tort, where a defen-\ndant steals a chattel of sentimental value or, having acquired first\npossession of it in good faith, refuses to surrender it, in defiance of\nthe owner?s enduring title.\nSpecific Redelivery and Injunction\nThe principle of subjective association is not, however, entirely novel.\n24\nAs early as Somerset v Cookson in 1735 we find the judge observing\nthat it would be ?very hard? if somebody who came by an object of\nantiquity through trespass or other wrong ?should have it in his\npower to keep the thing paying only the intrinsic value?. In fact this\nwas a case where recognition of the special value of a particular chat-\ntel found expression not in the form of an enhanced award of dam-\nages, but through the grant of a court order for delivery up of the\nobject. It is well established that a person whose chattel has been\nwrongfully taken or detained may, at the court?s discretion, obtain an\norder for the return of the chattel, rather than for the mere payment\nof damages, where financial compensation alone would be an inade-\nquate remedy. Such inadequacy may be apparent where the chattel is\nunique, irreplaceable, or integral to some ancient family tradition. A\n25\nvivid early example is Pusey v Pusey in 1684, where the court\nordered specific redelivery of the ancient horn by which the Pusey\nestates were held.\nHeirlooms are a particularly compelling illustration of the sort of\nchattel that is likely to attract specific relief.

There is, of course, every reason why the general prin-\nciple should apply in similar manner to emotionally charged objects\nthat were spoliated during the Holocaust, such as a painting given as\n28\na wedding present that counts as a ?childhood icon?. Indeed the cir-\ncumstances in which a Holocaust-related object became lost (such as\nmurder, forced flight, or other persecution) may intensify the moral\nimperative that it shall be returned to the victim?s family. If the\nAuschwitz suitcase had come into the possession of a private collec-\ntor and Mr Levi-Leleu had established a valid legal claim, it seems\nunthinkable that a court would award him the mere economic value\nof the suitcase, in preference to an order for its return.\nThe thinking behind cases like Somerset v Cookson and Pusey v\nPusey bears a family resemblance to a more recent decision on the\n29\nequitable remedy of injunction. In a recent dispute about the title to\ncertain watches that once belonged to Sir Edmund Hillary, the chil-\ndren of his first wife (who had died in 1975) sought an injunction to\nrestrain Sir Edmund?s widow Lady Hillary from allowing them to be\nsold at auction. Lady Hillary had already consigned the watches to\nan auction house at Geneva and now argued that the balance of con-\nvenience favoured maintaining the status quo, allowing the sale to\nproceed, and granting the offspring damages in the event that title to\nthe watches was ultimately shown to lie with them. An important\nstrand in her defence was the presence of a term, in her contract with\nthe auction house, that purported to oblige her to pay the auction\nhouse the commission that it would have earned (and its costs\nincurred to date) if the watches were withdrawn from sale. Having\ndecided that the children had a strong arguable case for asserting title\nto the watches, Mr Justice Venning held that the injunction should lie.\nIn his words:\n26\nLady Arundell v Phipps (1803) 13 Ves 95.\n27\nSomerset v Cookson (1735) 3 P Wms 390.\n28\nThis term was applied to the von Kalckreuth painting The Three Stages of\nLife successfully claimed by Marietta and Ernest Granville while it was on\nloan to the Royal Academy from the Neue Pinakothek in Munich.

Damages would not be an adequate\n30\nremedy. Those factors support the issue of an injunction.\nArchives and Reinstatement\nEven a corporation may, it seems, have a uniquely personal interest\nin tangible property of a cultural or historic nature that it has dili-\ngently accumulated, catalogued, and archived over its lifetime. The\n31\ndispute in Aerospace Publishing Ltd v Thames Water Utilities Ltd was\nwhether the proper redress available to the owner of an archive for\nthe substantial destruction of the archive by flooding should take the\nform of a financial payment to represent the diminution in value of\nthe archive or should rather consist of a sum of money to reflect the\ncost of reinstating the archive. Both in principle and in quantum\nthese two measures of assessment were significantly disparate. Lord\n32\nJustice Longmore acknowledged that this collection of historically\nsignificant material was a distinctive creation, distinguishable both\nfrom a mere assemblage of commercial goods and from a single mar-\nketable item of high cultural and economic worth:\n[T]he present case is not a case of a readily marketable asset,\nnor yet of a unique chattel like a rare manuscript, a Picasso\npainting or a Stradivarius violin. In the first sort of case little\ndifficulty will arise; reinstatement will not usually be appro-\npriate as it would not be reasonable to reinstate if an article can\nbe bought in by the claimant at a lower cost. In the case of a\nunique chattel it may be reasonable to reinstate but it will not\nbe too difficult, by reference to past auction prices, to assess\nrealistically a market value even though the chattel is itself\nunique. It will then be easy to compare figures for reinstate-\nment and market value.\n30\nIbid. at para 17. Cf. Tudberry v Sutton (1998) 20 Qld Lawyer Reports 13 at\n21 per Judge McGill QC.\n31\n[2007] EWCA Civ 3.\n32\nAt paras 50?2.\n17Articles\nLord Justice Longmore then proceeded to explain the peculiar char-\nacter of the archive and his sympathy for the arguments in favour of\nits reinstatement. In so doing he likened the archive to a human\nmemory and described its construction as ?a labour both of love and\ndedication?: \nPlutarch . . . regarded the human memory as an archive. In a\nsimilar way the archive in the present case represents the com-\npanies? memory and, as such, is an asset whose value could in\nconventional parlance be described as ?priceless? and whose\nactual value can only be calculated with considerable difficul-\nty . . . It was a labour both of love and dedication to build up\nand then catalogue the archive in the first place . . . If the\narchive of a famous and long-established art dealer such as the\nFine Art Society Ltd or an auctioneer such as Christie?s or\nSotheby?s were destroyed, it would be mealy-mouthed in the\nextreme to confine recovery to the re-sale value of individual\nitems.\nClaims by Nation-States\nThe philosophy of the family heirloom cases is, to some extent,\nmatched by the modern judicial approach to claims by States for the\nreturn of looted national treasures, such as archives, art, and archae-\nological items. Here again the tendency is to favour an order for the\nreturn of a culturally outstanding object rather than damages. Where\na foreign State can show that its domestic laws grant it a superior\nright of possession over undiscovered portable antiquities or other\ncultural objects unlawfully removed from its territory, the court will\nalmost invariably grant to that State an order for specific restitution\nagainst the wrongful possessor. In two modern cases courts have\nappealed to the identity of the looted objects as ?keys to the ancient\nhistory? of the State to justify ordering their return.\n33\nIn Webb v Ireland and the Attorney General the outcome of such\nreasoning was to recognize that title to a hoard of valuable ninth-cen-\ntury ecclesiastical artefacts, found on land close to Derrynaflan\nAbbey, lay with the Republic of Ireland in preference to the finders,\n33\n[1988] IR 353.\n18Emblems and Heirlooms\nwho were however rewarded for having declared the find. In  Govern -\n34\nment of the Islamic Republic of Iran v Barakat Galleries Ltd the question\nwas whether certain provisions of Iranian law conferred on Iran the\nownership of and the right of possession over antiquities that were\nallegedly buried on and illicitly excavated from Iranian territory. The\nCourt replied in the affirmative. Citing the Chief Justice of Ireland in\nWebb, the Chief Justice Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers regarded it\nas ?universally accepted? that one of the most important national\nassets belonging to the people of a country consists of their heritage\nand of the objects that constitute ?the keys to their ancient history?;\nand that a necessary ingredient of sovereignty in a modern State was\nand should be the ownership by the State of discovered objects con-\nstituting antiquities of importance which had no known owner.\nWhat may be true of nations may also be true of families and\nother communities or groups. They too may harbour a morally unan-\nswerable need to possess the keys to their ancient history. While their\nentitlement may only rarely if ever be embodied in statutes, the\nmoral demand that a family treasure be returned to that family may\nyet prove persuasive both within and beyond the courts. Victims of\npersecution whose loss has occurred through the gross violation of\nhuman rights, and for whom the contested object has a unique sub-\njective value surpassing its mere economic worth and rendering it\notherwise irreplaceable, might fairly expect an order for specific\nreturn rather than some monetary award. \nSale of Goods Cases: The Decree of Specific Performance\nOn occasions the commercial courts have dealt sensitively with the\nspecial interest that a collector may have in perfecting his or her ac -\nquis ition of a distinctive object. Such cases involve no history of loot-\ning but a simple refusal to perform a contract. Sellers of cultural or\nhistorical objects sometimes change their minds between contract\nand delivery, forcing the disappointed buyer to seek redress at law.\nWhereas the normal remedy for a seller?s failure to deliver, say, a\nwashing machine or a cargo of salt will be a judgment for damages,\nthe seller of a distinctive cultural object may be ordered to deliver the\n34\nGovernment of the Islamic Republic of Iran v Barakat Galleries Ltd [2009] QB 22,\n[2007] EWCA Civ 1374.\n19Articles\nexact thing. The normal mechanism to achieve this will be a decree of\nspecific performance, justified on the ground that (as with the cases\nof wrongful detention of heirlooms) damages are an inadequate rem-\nedy. A serious collector may well have a sufficiently personal inter-\nest in a chattel to qualify for such an order. \n35\nA modern case in point is Smythe v Thomas, where the seller had\nagreed to sell to a private collector a 1944 Wirraway Australian\nWarbird aircraft. The seller later refused to deliver the plane and the\nbuyer sued. One of the questions before the court was whether the\nseller should be allowed to keep the plane and merely compensate\nthe buyer in damages, paying him the difference between the value\nof the plane and the price that the buyer had agreed to pay, or should\nhand over the plane itself. Acting Justice Rein rejected the argument\nthat the seller should be liable only in damages, saying ?in my view\nthe nature of the subject of the bargain, which is not only a fine look-\ning aircraft . . . but is a vintage and unusual item, leads me to con-\nclude that the case is one in which . . . the relief of specific perform-\nance of the contract sought should be granted.? This case may be con-\ntrasted with an English decision over eighty years earlier, where a\ndealer who had bought Hepplewhite chairs for resale in his business\nwas held entitled to damages from his seller who refused to deliver\nthem, but failed to persuade the court to grant him an order of spe-\n36\ncific performance. In this case damages were an adequate remedy.\nHolocaust-Related Objects\nIs Money Ever a Sufficient Remedy?\nThe choice between monetary compensation and specific restitution\nraises a potentially delicate question for bodies that are appointed to\nhear claims for the return of Holocaust-related objects. In England\nsuch a body exists in the form of the Spoliation Advisory Panel. The\nPanel is empowered to recommend either the return of an object or\nthe payment of a monetary sum, whether by way of compensation or\nex gratia payment. Normally payments are recommended on ex gratia\n35\n[2007] NSWSC 844.\n36\nCohen v Roche [1927] 1 KB 169.\n20Emblems and Heirlooms\nterms, on the reasoning that the term ?compensation? should be con-\nfined to payments in respect of surviving legal rights and no legal\nright survives on the facts in question. It is not impossible that the\nPanel might be urged to take account, in deciding whether to recom-\nmend the return of the object or an ex gratia payment, of the nature of\nthe original owner?s relationship with the chattel. As we have seen,\nat common law the remedy of specific delivery is generally confined\nto cases where the owner?s predominant subjective interest in the\nchattel means that damages would be an inadequate remedy. Claims\nrelating to a merchant?s trading stock might generally be expected to\nattract an award of damages rather than the remedy of enforced rede-\nlivery. But suppose that the dispossession occurred through the oper-\nation of racially discriminatory laws in Germany at the height of the\nNazi era. The ethical demand, that such atrocities be redressed, may\nnot be adequately fulfilled by an award of money even though the\nvictim had acquired the chattel only in order to sell it. The mere pay-\nment of money may fall short of achieving full justice, however lib-\neral the sum and however impersonal the victim?s connection with\nthe chattel.\nNot all of the public pronouncements acknowledging the subjec-\ntive value of chattels are from common law countries such as\nEngland and Australia, and not all are decisions of courts. In a deter-\nmination made by the Dutch Restitution Committee in 2009, the\nquestion was whether the Committee should apply the presumption,\nauthorized by its terms of reference, that transactions by which\nJewish people disposed of precious objects of a private nature during\nthe Nazi occupation were flawed by Holocaust-related oppression.\nThe claim concerned certain objects that had been the property of\nCarl Van Lier, an Amsterdam dealer, and had since the War various-\nly found their way into the collections of the Netherlands Institute for\nCultural Heritage and the National Museum of Ethnology at Leiden.\nThe Committee concluded that most of the objects that departed from\nVan Lier?s stock had not been disposed of involuntarily through\ntheft, confiscation, or coercive dealing, or any direct threat thereof.\nBut in the single case of a hunting horn made of elephant ivory, the\nCommittee took a different view. There was evidence that Van Lier\nattached personal value to the object and that it belonged to his pri-\nvate collection as opposed to his trading stock. Among the clues to\nthis effect was a photographic family portrait in which Van Lier was\n21Articles\nblowing the horn. This went to trigger the more lenient standards of\nproof applicable to private possessions and to justify the Com mit -\ntee?s conclusion that Van Lier did not part with the horn willingly.\n[T]he Committee feels that there is sufficient cause for another\njudgement with regard to one object, NK 396, an ivory hunting\nhorn. In a family portrait of Van Lier from around 1930, he is\nblowing this horn. For the family, this photograph provides a\nsalient image of their forefather and of an art object that was of\nunique value to him, thus giving the object an emotional value\nto the family.\nComparison Between the Dutch and the United Kingdom Spoliation Bodies\nThe Van Lier claim illustrates several differences between the Dutch\nHolocaust claims experience and that of the UK. One is the absence\nfrom the regulating terms of the Spoliation Advisory Panel of any\nformal dichotomy between commercial possessions (?trading stock?)\nand private possessions, and of any presumption that a disposal of\nprivately owned objects during the Nazi era was involuntary. A fur-\nther point of contrast perhaps is the relative value and commercial\nappeal of objects claimed within the two countries. While much of\nthe cultural material claimed in the Netherlands has been of high\nvalue, claims have also been made for a significant number of rela-\ntively everyday objects. This is consistent with the level of original\ntakings by the Nazis and their satellites: we are told that many Dutch\npeople owned at least one good painting or item of furniture suffi-\n37\nciently attractive to the predators to be filched. It is therefore unsur-\nprising that such objects should now be the subjects of claims. In the\nUnited Kingdom, which was never occupied or ransacked, claims are\nlikely to be limited to things stolen on the Continent and brought into\nthe country after the War. Once again, the main targets of such\nimportation are likely to have been the higher-value objects, many of\nwhich will have since found their way into museums.\n37\nPalmer, Museums and the Holocaust, 2?3, n. 8.\n22Emblems and Heirlooms\nThe Link Between Preservation and Value\nNot all Holocaust-related objects, then, are intrinsically ordinary.\nMany of the paintings and other chattels claimed by Holocaust sur-\nvivors or their descendants have a pronounced cultural or historical\nsignificance. The past decade has witnessed a sharp rise in the num-\nber of such claims. At the beginning of the present century the Blair\ngovernment responded by establishing the Spoliation Advisory\nPanel. The task of the Panel was to advise the government on claims\nagainst publicly funded museums by Holocaust survivors and their\nfamilies.\nIt comes as no surprise that most of the claims brought before the\nPanel have been for cultural objects of high financial value. At the\nrisk of generalization, such objects may have stood a better chance of\nsurviving the war because preserving them would have been a pri-\nority. There is also a better chance that the provenance of such objects\nwill have been recorded and that their original owner will be identi-\nfiable. Such objects are more likely to be worth the cost of investing\nin legal advice and action. Where the law allows special redress\nagainst museums, in the shape of the Spoliation Advisory Panel and\nthe Holocaust (Return of Cultural Objects) Act 2009, the benefits of\nsuch redress are naturally confined to those who claim objects desir-\nable enough to have been acquired by museums.\nThe Spoliation Advisory Panel\nThe Minister for the Arts established the Spoliation Advisory Panel\nin June 2000 to consider claims against publicly funded museums by\nthose who lost possession of cultural objects between the years 1933\nand 1945. The Panel is entrusted with evaluating the moral quality as\nwell as the legal force of individual claims. Paragraph 7(e) of its\nTerms of Reference requires the Panel to ?give due weight to the\nmoral strength of the claimant?s case? while Paragraph 7(g) requires\nthe Panel to ?consider whether any moral obligation rests on the insti-\ntution?. In the latter regard, the Panel must take into account ?in par-\nticular? the circumstances in which the object was acquired by the\ninstitution, and the institution?s knowledge at that juncture of the\nobject?s provenance. The phrase ?in particular? admits of considera-\ntions other than the circumstances of a museum?s acquisition, includ-\n23Articles\ning the basic proposition that the object was taken from the claimant\nwithout consent and in circumstances never since ratified. An inno-\ncent acquisition does not therefore necessarily denote a creditable\nretention. The institution may owe a moral obligation to return an\nobject irrespective of any moral transgression on its part.\n38\nA Survey of Claims before the Spoliation Advisory Panel\nTate\nThe case of the painting View of Hampton Court Palace by Jan Griffier\nthe Elder in the Tate Gallery, which was the subject of a report by the\nPanel in January 2001, is now well known. The children of a woman\nwhose husband had been shot by the Nazis and who, in hiding from\nthe Nazis in Belgium, was compelled to part with a treasured object\nin return for enough money to buy an apple and an egg, were award-\ned an ex gratia payment to reflect, with certain adjustments, the cur-\nrent market value of the work. This resolution was acceptable to the\nclaimants and to the Tate Gallery, which was at that time debarred by\nlaw from disposing of Holocaust-related (and indeed other) objects\nvest ed in the Trustees as part of its collection. No less convenient to\nthe Gallery was the Panel?s further proposal that the payment be\ndrawn from public funds and not from the Gallery?s own resources.\nThe award of money was supplemented by a recommendation that a\ncommemorative notice be installed in the space adjacent to the paint-\ning, recalling the circumstances in which it was lost.\nAmong the significant features of the Griffier recommendation\nwas the emphasis by the Panel on the public benefit derived from the\nTate?s forty-year possession of the work. This was regarded as rele-\nvant to two distinct questions: the identity of the payer of the ex gratia\nsum and the computation of the sum itself. On the first point, as we\nhave seen, the Panel held that the payment should be made from gen -\neral funds and not from the Tate?s own resources. On the second\n38\nIn addition to the cases discussed below there are further reports from the\nPanel on claims involving the Courtauld Institute. See Report of the Spoliation\nAdvisory Panel on Eight Paintings in the Possession of the Samuel Courtauld Trust\n(24 June 2009); Report of the Spoliation Advisory Panel in respect of an Oil Sketch\nby Sir Peter Paul Rubens ?The Coronation of the Virgin?, now in the Possession of\nthe Samuel Courtauld Trust (15 Dec. 2010). \n24Emblems and Heirlooms\npoint, the Panel held that the sum payable should include an amount\nfor the past public enjoyment of the work in addition to its market\nvalue.\nBetween 2004 and 2009 the Panel reported on seven further claims\nfor the restitution of objects in museums. In two of them?the Burrell\nand British Library claims?the Panel recommended the specific res -\nti tution of the work. Both recommendations were made despite the\nfact that a legal bar existed on the relinquishment of the work from\nthe collection in which it resided. In the Burrell case the object was\nnot eventually relinquished to the claimants while in the Benevento\ncase it was.\nBurrell\nIn 1936 a German Jewish family, who were shareholders in a promi-\nnent and reputable firm of art dealers, were subjected to a penal and\ndiscriminatory tax demand by a newly appointed tax inspector with\nNazi sympathies. Being forced to sell their stock at very short notice,\nthey consigned it to auction in Berlin. The sale arguably yielded nor-\nmal market prices, but would never have occurred but for the vic-\ntimization of the family. The receipts vanished immediately into the\nmaw of the tax authorities. One senior member of the family, acutely\ndistressed, had died of a stroke in a taxi after leaving an interview\nwith the inspector. The rest of the family discharged the fictitious\ndebt and fled to the United States.\nOne picture, thought at the time of the sale to be the work of\nChardin but later discredited by Pierre Rosenberg, was knocked\ndown to a dealer. The dealer re-sold it in Berlin shortly after the auc-\ntion. The buyer was Sir William Burrell, the Scottish shipping mag-\nnate and a distinguished collector. Sir William took the work to\nScotland and in 1944 he and Lady Burrell donated it, along with some\neight thousand other works, to the Corporation of the City of\nGlasgow. The gift was made subject to an express prohibition (appar-\nently contractual in nature) on any disposal from the collection. It\ndenied to the donees any entitlement whatever to ?sell or donate or\nexchange? works from the collection.\nThe Panel noted the sizeable volume of works donated by Sir\nWilliam and the difficult conditions under which the gift was exe-\ncuted. It exonerated the City of moral blame and accepted that the\n25Articles\nJewish family?s legal title was now defunct, but held that the moral\nargument for redress had been amply established. Notwithstanding\nSir William?s embargo on disposal, the Panel recommended the\nreturn of the work to surviving members of the family. It took the\nview that it was arguable that the prohibition on disposal should not\napply to an act of restitution in circumstances such as these, and it\nrecommended that the City take legal advice on this question.\nContrary to the Panel?s expectation, the legal advice received by\nthe City of Glasgow did not recognize any liberty in the City to dis-\npose of the painting in the circumstances or on the grounds stated by\nthe Panel. In the event the parties agreed on an ex gratia payment, and\nthe work remained with the City.\nBritish Library\nIn 1946 a British army officer named Captain D. G. Ash offered to the\nBritish Museum a twelfth-century missal in Benevantan script. He\nsaid that he had bought it from a Naples bookseller while on active\nduty in 1944. In fact, the missal belonged to the Archdiocese of\nBenevento. It had been removed from Benevento in unidentified cir-\ncumstances, not necessarily by Captain Ash. Dr Collins, the curator\nto whom the officer showed the missal, recommended that he inves-\ntigate whether it was war loot. In 1947 the missal was offered for auc-\ntion at Sotheby?s in London and the Museum, having conducted no\nfurther independent investigation of its provenance, acquired it.\nIn a claim by the Archbishop, whose predecessor had first re -\nquested its return in 1978, the Panel concluded that on a balance of\nprobabilities the missal was removed from the possession of the\nArchdiocese during or shortly after the hostilities that affected the\nregion in 1944. It followed that the removal occurred within the time\nspan (1933?45) stipulated in the Panel?s terms of reference. The Panel\nfurther concluded that the Museum had paid insufficient regard to\nthe prospect of unlawful removal when it acquired the work, and\nthat the moral case for restitution was made out.\nAs with the Burrell claim, the Panel took the view that neither the\nadmitted extinction of the Archdiocese?s legal title by lapse of time,\nnor the existence of a legal bar to disposal (in this case, a statutory bar\nimposed by the British Library Act 1972) should inhibit it from rec-\nommending that the object be returned. The Panel proposed not only\n26Emblems and Heirlooms\n(i) that the missal be returned, but also (ii) that the British Library Act\n1972 be amended to make this possible, and (iii) that until such\namend ment was made the missal should be sent to Benevento on  \n39\nloan.\nBoth the terms of the preliminary loan to Benevento, and the form\nof the required statutory amendment to the British Library Act 1972,\ncontinued to be debated over a long period after the Panel?s report.\nIn the event the Missal did not finally return to Benevento until early\nin 2011. Meanwhile the subtle and delicate political considerations\nthat bear upon any prospective amendment of UK national museum\nstatutes had led the British Museum in another case to explore an\nalternative route to achieve the power to renounce objects from its\n40\ncollection. The occasion for this development was a claim for the\nrestitution of four Old Master drawings bought by the Museum in\n1946. The Gestapo had in 1939 seized the drawings from Dr Feld -\nmann, a Jewish lawyer in Brno in Czechoslovakia, who was later\nmurdered by the Nazis. The Chancery Division of the High Court,\nthough sympathetic to the claim and to the Museum?s desire to hon-\nour it, held that the provision on which the Museum relied (section\n27 of the Charities Act 1993) did not grant to the Museum any over-\nriding power of relinquishment, such as to enable the Museum to dis-\nregard the prohibitions on disposal in the British Museum Act 1963.\nAshmolean\nIn 2000 descendants of the deceased Jewish banker Jakob Gold -\nschmidt laid claim to a work by Mair von Landshut, Portrait of a\nYoung Girl in a Bow Window, now held by the Ashmolean Museum.\nGold schmidt had owned the painting in Germany before the Second\nWorld War. The Ashmolean had accepted it as a bequest from the\nestate of William Spooner in 1967, knowing at the time that it had\nbelonged to Goldschmidt between the wars.\nThe inter-war history of the work was one of the matters in dis-\npute. Following the economic crisis of 1929, Goldschmidt had been\n39\nIt will be seen from this claim that both the historical sweep and the ma -\nterial scope of the Panel?s jurisdiction are wide. The victim was a religious\ninstitution, there was no direct element of racial persecution, and it is at least\nas likely that the work was removed by Allied as by Axis forces. \n40\nSee below. \n27Articles\nobliged to commit many of his art objects towards the discharge of\ndebts incurred on the collapse of the Danatbank, which he had\nfound ed. The relevant instruments of commitment were made first\nwith the Danatbank itself and latterly with the Thyssen Iron and Steel\nWorks. The Ashmolean contended that the von Landshut was among\nthe committed works, and that its sale at auction in 1936, far from\nbeing an involuntary effect of Nazi policy and/or Goldschmidt?s\nJewish identity, followed from the agreement made by Goldschmidt\nin 1932 with the Thyssen organization, by which Thyssen were to\nmanage Gold schmidt?s debts. By the time of that sale, Goldschmidt\nhimself had already (in 1933) departed for the USA.\nThe heirs alleged that Goldschmidt had continued to own the\nwork until its sale in 1936, that it was not among the works secured\ntowards the payment of his debts, that even if it was thus secured it\nhad been secured only by a pledge, which did not transfer ownership\nto his creditors, that the sale of the object that was Goldschmidt?s\nenduring property was a forced sale vitiated by material duress\nand/or the generally oppressive conditions afflicting Jews in Ger -\nmany, and that those general conditions had prevented Goldschmidt\nfrom redeeming his financial position and discharging whatever\ndebts (if any) the work had been sold to satisfy. On the strength of\nthese assertions, the heirs argued that the proper moral outcome was\nthe return of the work to them from the Ashmolean.\nThe Spoliation Advisory Panel rejected this analysis, holding in\neffect that the work was among those secured in favour of\nGoldschmidt?s creditors, that the security executed by Goldschmidt\ngave to the creditors both ownership of the work and the right to sell\nit on default, that the sole occasion for the sale was the failure of\nGoldschmidt to discharge the secured debts by other means, and that\nboth Goldschmidt?s inability to redeem his finances and the conse-\nquent sale of the von Landshut were causally unconnected with and\nuntainted by the generally oppressive conditions afflicting Jewish\npeople in Germany over the period in question.\nThe Panel further held that the Ashmolean, having been aware on\nits acquisition that the work had once belonged to Goldschmidt, had\nreasonably and properly concluded that his cessation of ownership\nstemmed from general and personal financial crises. It followed that\nthe Ashmolean could not be visited with any moral censure in\nrespect of the manner of its acquisition, or indeed in respect of its\n28Emblems and Heirlooms\nresponse to the claim: ?When the Painting was bequeathed to the\nAshmolean in 1967 there was no reason to suspect that it could be the\nsubject of a spoliation claim. It must also be remembered that the cir-\ncumstances of the Danatbank?s collapse and Goldschmidt?s liabilities\nwere internationally known and easy to reference. Thus it would\nhave been natural to assume that the Painting had been sold in 1936\n41\nto meet Goldschmidt?s debts.? The Panel accordingly recommend-\ned that no action be taken in response to the claim.\nThe Rothberger Porcelain Claims: British Museum and Fitzwilliam\nMuseum\nOn the application of the claimant, Mrs Bertha Gutmann of New\nJersey, and with the consent of the museums concerned, the Panel\nconsidered jointly two separate claims concerning porcelain items.\nThe first item was held in the collection of the British Museum, and\nthe second in the collection of the Fitzwilliam Museum. Both items\nhad allegedly been taken by the Gestapo in 1938 from the claimant?s\nuncle, Heinrich Rothberger, in a seizure substantiated by authorita-\ntive historical research published in 2003 on Mr Rothberger?s art col-\nlection. Neither Museum disputed the claimant?s assertion of entitle-\nment to the items. The claimant was able to produce for the Panel a\nseries of wills of family members that established her sole entitlement\nto the objects.\nIdentity of the British Museum item. The British Museum Curator of\nPre-History and Europe advised the Panel that she considered it very\nlikely that the piece in the museum collection was the piece owned\nby the claimant?s uncle. Her opinion was based, among other factors,\non the description of the object in a publication of the time, the rarity\nof the object, and the fact that no others similar to it had been traced\nto date. It was, in her view, also unlikely that the piece would have\nbeen disposed of before the Gestapo seized the collection. The piece\nhad been presented to the British Museum by a member of staff in\n1939 and, though it was not known how he acquired it, the Museum\naccepted that he might have seen it in Vienna and known the Roth -\nberger collection. Accepting the curator?s reasons, the Panel accepted\n41\nReport of the Spoliation Advisory Panel in respect of a Painting held by the\nAshmolean Museum in Oxford (1 Mar. 2006), para 47.\n29Articles\nthat the Museum piece was the piece formerly owned by Mr Roth -\nberger.\nIdentity of the Fitzwilliam item. The Director of the Fitzwilliam\nMuseum advised the Panel that a former director had bequeathed the\nitem to the Museum in 1960. The former director had bought it prior\nto October 1948, when it was valued by Sotheby?s valuation at his\nhome in Cambridgeshire, and stated by Sotheby?s to be from the\nRoth berger Collection. The exact circumstances in which the donor\nacquired the item were unknown. While inconsistencies in the refer-\nences to the Rothberger item and the Fitzwilliam item in the 1938 sale\ncatalogue meant that the two items could not conclusively be said to\nbe one and the same, the Panel concluded that it was likely that the\nFitzwilliam item, having regard to its size, form, decoration, label,\nand Sotheby?s statement, had indeed belonged to Rothberger. The\nPanel therefore accepted that the museum piece was formerly the\nproperty of, and had been taken from, Heinrich Rothberger.\nThe Panel went on to conclude that both museums now had un -\nchallengeable legal title to the porcelain in their possession. The foun-\ndation for this view was that any once-existent claim was now time-\nbarred under the Limitation Act 1939. Further, in the Panel?s view the\nmuseums had acquired the objects in good faith. The British Museum\nhad exercised acceptable museum practices characteristic of the era,\nwhereas the Fitzwilliam Museum, while perhaps under a heavier\nobligation by the 1960s to inquire into provenance, was under-\nresourced and could not therefore be criticized for the measures and\npractices that it exercised at that time. The Panel further observed\nthat, whereas any relinquishment of the British Museum piece was\nprohibited under the British Museum Act 1963, no similar statute\nprevented the Fitzwilliam Museum from relinquishing the item in its\npossession.\nHaving concluded that there was no claim at law, the Panel went\non to consider the moral position. It acknowledged that the moral\nbasis for each claim was substantial. As to the British Museum item,\nthe Panel acknowledged that the claimant would ideally have pre-\nferred specific restitution, as she had sought for the Fitzwilliam piece.\nIn the circumstances, however, it accepted that the preferable solu-\ntion was to recommend (i) an ex gratia payment reflecting the con-\ntemporary value of the item as appraised by independent valuers,\ncombined with (ii) a public acknowledgement of the item?s prove-\n30Emblems and Heirlooms\nnance, and of the goodwill of the successor to Mr Rothberger, in any\nfuture display or publication of the item. The Panel took account of\nthree independent capital valuations, and of the likely insurance\ncosts had the items remained with the claimant?s family, in reaching\na recommended valuation of ?18,000. It further recommended that\nsuch payment be made by the state from central funds and not by the\nMuseum. This recommendation was considered to conform to the\ngeneral advice of the Lord Chancellor, and to reflect a fair solution,\ngiven that the tax paying public will be able to continue to study the\nitem and derive benefit from it. In relation to the Fitzwilliam item, the\nPanel concluded that, while the piece was of considerable importance\nto the Museum?s collection, the moral demands of specific restitution\noutweighed this consideration and that specific restitution should be\nmade.\nSome Observations on the Spoliation Advisory Committee Claims\nThe Subjective Element\nWhile all of the foregoing items had an objective money value, some\nat least would also have been personally meaningful, not only to the\noriginal owners but to their descendants and family. Many were pri-\nvately collected by connoisseurs, who might be expected to cherish\nsuch things for their own sake. Many were taken in barbarous and\ndiscriminatory conditions that cried aloud for atonement. All those\nobjects that had belonged to private persons recalled a past way of\nlife that had been irreversibly mutilated. Such circumstances would\nhave intensified the moral impulse towards restitution in cases\nwhere the loss was attributable to Nazification. But none of the\nclaimants sought any independent financial redress for the personal\nanguish that they suffered in consequence of their being deprived of\nthe objects. This may have been because there was no reprehensible\n42\nconduct by the particular respondent, though in principle that\n43\nalone might not have been a barrier.\n42\nThe one exception to this remark was the Benevento claim, and there the\nclaimant was in effect (if not nominally) an institution.\n43\nIt will have been noted that the Panel is empowered to make money\nawards in place of the specific return of works. In the two cases where the\nPanel proposed a money award (Griffier/Tate and Rothberger/British Mu -\n31Articles\nPower to Renounce\nStatutory prohibitions on disposal have until recently dominated the\nclaims brought against national museums. Apart from the Benevento\nmissal and Fitzwilliam porcelain claims, there has been no single case\nin which return was recommended and return has actually yet taken\n44\nplace. In Attorney-General v Trustees of the British Museum, the British\nMuseum tried to avoid the need for legislative amendment by\nrecruiting section 27 of the Charities Act 1993 to justify the return of\nworks that the Museum felt morally obliged to return. The failure of\nthis attempt left the route to restitution unresolved and intensified\nthe demand for a clear source of authority by which national mu -\nseums like the British Museum could relinquish Holocaust-related\ncultural objects when they considered the circumstances to justify the\n45\nrelease. In due course the Government issued a consultation paper.\nIt was not, however, until four years after the British Museum case that\nthe path was unblocked. This occurred through the enactment of the\nHolocaust (Return of Cultural Objects) Act 2009, examined below.\nThe claim in Attorney-General v Trustees of the British Museum in -\nvolved four Old Master drawings taken by the Gestapo at Brno in\nMarch 1939 from the Czech lawyer and collector Dr Arthur Feld -\nmann, who was imprisoned and subsequently murdered. All four\ndraw ings were later acquired by the British Museum: three by pur-\nchase and one by bequest. The Museum wished to return the draw-\nings, contending that it had a moral obligation to do so. But its appli-\ncation on that ground to the Chancery Division of the High Court\nfailed. The Vice-Chancellor held that the Charities Act could not be\ninvoked to override the statutory prohibition on disposal.\nThe story did not end there. Following the decision of the High\nCourt, the claimants moderated their claim to one for financial pay-\nment, and the parties jointly referred the claim to the Spoliation\nAdvisory Panel, which upheld it. The drawings remained in the Mu -\nseum), the claimants were willing to accede. It is a question whether the\nrefusal of a claimant who is unwilling to accept money should conclude the\nmatter and whether money can include a sum to represent distress. The\nPanel can also recommend commemorative and conciliatory action.\n44\n[2005] EWHC 1089.\n45\nRestitution of Objects Spoliated in the Nazi Era: A Consultation Document (July\n2006).\n32Emblems and Heirlooms\nseum, and Dr Feldmann?s descendants received a recommended ex\ngratia sum of ?175,000. This sum comprised a contemporary market\nvaluation of ?186,000 from which ?11,000 was deducted to take\naccount of potential insurance and sale costs that the claimants might\nreasonably have been expected to incur had they possessed the\nworks and decided to sell them. The Panel further recommended that\nthe sum be paid from central funds rather than by the British Mu -\nseum.\nNor, as we have seen, did the story end with the settlement of the\nparticular claim. Both the Feldmann case and that of the Benevento\nmissal raised in sharp focus the inconvenience of those statutory fet-\nters on disposal that inhibit a museum from adopting the morally\nimperative solution of relinquishing spoliated objects. The scope and\ncontent of legislative amendments designed to relax these fetters\nwere in due course the subject of a consultation document published\n46\nby the Department of Culture, Media and Sport. At that time it was\nthe apparent view of the DCMS that the statutory power of release\nrecommended in the Benevento claim should be effected by separate\nand specific legislation, while the power to release objects in response\nto more ?mainstream? claims (such as Burrell or the British Museum)\nshould be conferred by general legislation, but on terms circum-\nscribed by some such phrase as ?in circumstances directly related to?\nor ?arising or resulting? from the actions of the Nazis, their collabora-\n47\ntors or allies. In fact, the outcome was a single piece of legislation,\nthe Holocaust (Return of Cultural Objects) Act 2009.\nThe New Statutory Power to Transfer Objects from Collections\nSummarized broadly, the Holocaust (Return of Cultural Objects) Act\n2009 enables certain national institutions in the United Kingdom to\nrelease Holocaust-related objects from their collections, and to trans-\nfer those objects to claimants including Holocaust survivors or their\n48\ndescendants. There had for some time been disquiet about the\n46\nRestitution of Objects Spoliated in the Nazi Era: A Consultation Document (July\n2006).\n47\nIbid. paras 3.1 to 3.24.\n48\nBy section 4(2) the Act extends to England and Wales, and Scotland. The\nheading to section 2 of the Act reads ?Power to return victims? property?. \n33Articles\nBritish Museum?s perceived inability to make restitution to the des -\ncend ants of Dr Feldmann. In 2005, as we have observed, the Chan -\ncery Division of the High Court held that it was impermissible to\noverride the constraints imposed by the British Museum Act by an\n49\nappeal to section 27 of the Charities Act 1993. It became clear to the\ngovernment that new legislation was needed. As we have seen, a\nConsultation Paper seeking advice on the potential form of that leg-\n50\nislation was published in 2006.\nThe new legislation is tightly drawn, both in regard to the institu-\n51\ntions covered, and in regard to the material that might be relin-\nquished. It is couched in discretionary terms and at no point man-\ndates the return of any object. So much is plain from its long title, ?An\nAct to confer power to return certain cultural objects on grounds\nrelating to events occurring during the Nazi era?. By section 2(1) of\nthe Act, any institution to which the Act applies may transfer an\nobject from its collections if two conditions are met. The first condi-\ntion, imposed by section 2(2), is that the Advisory Panel has recom-\nmended the transfer. The second condition, imposed by section 2(3),\nis that the Secretary of State has approved the Advisory Panel?s rec-\n52\nommendation. The foregoing power does not affect, and thus can-\nnot enable an institution to override, any trust or condition subject to\nwhich any object is held. So much is stipulated by section 2(6), which\nresembles in this regard the equivalent provision in section 47(4) of\nthe Human Tissue Act 2004.\n49\nAttorney-General v Trustees of the British Museum [2005] EWHC 1089 (Ch).\n50\nAbove, n. 45.\n51\nThese are prescribed by section 1 of the Act, and include the Trustees of\nthe British Museum, the Trustees of the Imperial War Museum, the Board of\nTrustees of the National Gallery, the Board of Trustees of the Wallace\nCollection, the Board of Trustees of the National Museums and Galleries on\nMerseyside, and the Board of Trustees of the National Museums of Scotland.\nThis list is not exhaustive. By section 2(4) the Secretary of State may approve\na recommendation for the transfer of an object from the collections of a\nScottish body only with the consent of the Scottish Ministers. By section 2(5)\n?Scottish body? means the Board of Trustees for the National Galleries of\nScotland, the Trustees of the National Library of Scotland, and the Board of\nTrustees of the National Museums of Scotland.\n52\nThe power conferred by section 2(1) ?is an additional power?: section 2(7).\n34Emblems and Heirlooms\nBy section 3(1), the term ?Advisory Panel? means for the purposes\nof the Act a panel for the time being designated by the Secretary of\nState for those purposes. The Secretary of State may designate a panel\nfor the purposes of this Act only if the panel?s functions consist of the\nconsideration of claims which (a) are made in respect of objects, and\n(b) relate to events occurring during the Nazi era.\nAside from various provisions related to the coming into force of\n53\nthe Act, the sole outstanding provision of the Act is the sunset\nclause contained in section 4(7). Under that provision, ?This Act\nexpires at the end of the period of 10 years beginning with the day on\nwhich it is passed?.\nThe fact that the Act authorizes an institution to transfer an object\nfrom ?its? collections indicates with reasonable clarity that relinquish-\nment is authorized only where the object has formerly become the\nproperty of that institution. On this analysis there is conversely no\nstatutory authority to relinquish where the institution is merely in\npossession of the object and does not own it. It can hardly be sup-\nposed that the Act empowers an institution to dispose of an object\nthat is not its own property. If, therefore, there is any realistic pro -\nspect that a Holocaust-related object remains the property of some\nperson other than the institution, the statutory enablement may not\napply and the institution would need to take further advice before\nrelinquishing that object. Of course, if the owner of the object is the\nclaimant now seeking its transfer there would seem to be no pre-\nexisting bar on its release by the institution to that party, and the Act\nis unnecessary to achieve that: the institution would simply be\nreturning the object to the party who has legal title. Moreover, there\nare many cases (probably the majority) where, however deplorable\nthe original deprivation, the institution is in fact the current owner.\nSo much is clear from the substantial number of cases before the\nSpoliation Advisory Panel where the Panel has concluded, or the par-\nties have conceded, that the victim?s original ownership is defunct.\n53\nSection 4(3): ?The preceding sections of this Act come into force on such\nday as the Secretary of State may by order appoint.? By section 4(4): ?An order\nmay make different provision for different purposes.? By section 4(5): ?Before\nappointing a day for the coming into force of the preceding sections of this\nAct so far as they relate to Scottish bodies the Secretary of State must consult\nthe Scottish Ministers.? By section 4(6): ? ?Scottish body? has the meaning\ngiven by section 2(5).?\n35Articles\nBut in cases where there might exist other potential claimants, capa-\nble of asserting title, it might be imprudent of the institution to\nassume that it owns the object and that the Act itself justifies release\nto the immediate claimant. Such a situation might arise where fami-\nly members are in disagreement (or have simply not been consulted)\nabout the ownership and desired destination of the object.\nConclusion\nThe enlarged ability of national museums to relinquish Holocaust-\nrelated objects, introduced by the Holocaust (Return of Cultural Ob -\njects) Act 2009, gives statutory recognition to the value of a claimant?s\npersonal association with such an object. It impliedly acknowledges\nthat sometimes only the restitution of the object (as compared, for ex -\nample, to a money payment) is an appropriate res ponse to the claim -\nant?s sense of personal loss.\nThe fact that some Holocaust-related objects are of minor eco-\nnomic value but substantial personal importance nonetheless sug-\ngests a need to reappraise certain conventional attitudes to the man-\nagement of claims. Of course, one cannot tell how many minor-value\nobjects are extant and identifiable, and concern about such items may\nprove to be disproportionate to the power of public or private agen-\ncies to do anything about them, or indeed to the cost of such action if\nit were in theory viable. But to an extent it may be the very flaws of\nthe existing treatment that make such identification so difficult.\nDespite the tremendous economies and other advantages extended\nto claimants by the existence of the Spoliation Advisory Panel the\nexisting regime patently favours those who claim high-value objects.\nThere are few if any instances of claims to items of intense subjective\nvalue and high sentimental worth, or indeed of low economic value.\nAside from the Rothberger porcelain award of ?18,000 (for a single\nitem) the lowest-value claim appears to have been for the Burrell-\ndonated painting P?t? de Jambon valued by the Panel at ?7,500. This\nvaluation was reached only after the attribution of the work to\nChardin had been discredited. While family emblematic status has\noccasionally been attributed to work claimed outside the Spoliation\nPanel (for example the von Kalckreuth ?childhood icon?) the con-\nscious ascription of such status remains rare. One looks in vain for\n36Emblems and Heirlooms\nassertions of such status (and for claims for money payments to\nreflect personal distress at deprivation) in submissions before the\nSpoliation Advisory Panel. No doubt this is in part because a claim\ncan be brought before the Panel only where the institution is in pos-\nsession of the claimed work, and in those circumstances claimants\nare likely to demand the physical redelivery of the work itself. But\nthere seems no reason in principle why a claim for compensation or\nan ex gratia payment to relieve personal distress might not be com-\nbined with a claim for specific restitution, or indeed advanced as an\nalternative.\nThis atmosphere of disadvantage to the small-scale victim may be\nreflected in other corners of our legal system. For example, there is an\ningrained and justified judicial dislike of litigation that costs more\nthan the value of its subject matter. A sense of proportion in such\nmatters is part of the overriding principle that courts must do justice\nbetween the parties. A successful claimant might therefore fail to\nrecover costs from the losing party where the matter at hand could\nreasonably and more economically have been referred to alternative\ndispute resolution. A typical expression of this view can be found in\n54\nthe judgment of Lord Justice Ward in Tavoulareas v Lau, where the\nwarring parties had collectively expended ?85,000 on a dispute over\nart works that were valued at a maximum of ?23,500. Lord Justice\nWard said:\nThis litigation fills me with despair . . . litigation must be fun if\nthe parties are prepared to spend that much on a rollercoaster\nride to judgment without pausing, either of them, to suggest\nthat mediation would be a more sensible way to resolve their\ndifferences . . . I would have thought that there are very easy\nways through mediation and a bit of common sense to resolve\nthis matter and hopefully to resolve it quickly and without a\nfurther extraordinary waste of money. \nHere again, however, one must beware of reducing this area of resti-\ntution to a simple matter of economics. While no litigant should be\nencouraged to take prodigal action in pursuing a claim for restitu-\ntion, it seems fair to suggest that certain Holocaust-related objects are\n54\n[2007] EWCA Civ 474.\n37Articles\nso heavily charged with legitimate personal concerns, peculiar to the\nindividual and divorced from their economic value, that it could be\nreasonable to pursue them through court action, even though the cost\nof such action exceeds their economic worth. A similar argument\nmight be made about claims by indigenous peoples to recover ances-\ntral remains or other relics having spiritual force. In many cases court\naction may be the only way to compel a museum or private posses-\nsor to pay serious attention to a claim. Indeed there is one instance\nwhere an English national museum has agreed to mediation only\n55\nafter being taken to court. It would be unfortunate if the low eco-\nnomic value of the material claimed were to be invoked as a ground\nfor denying costs to the successful claimant.\nThe emotional bond between a Holocaust victim and a chattel\nmight suggest that an element of personal hurt could figure in a\nclaim for damages based on the loss or destruction of the object. It is\nnotable that almost every Holocaust-related claim in England has\nrelated to an existing chattel of which the claimant has (at least ini-\ntially) sought specific restitution. There has been no claim for either\ncompensation or an ex gratia payment based on the wrongful taking\nor violation of a chattel that no longer exists. Should such a claim\narise, there is no reason in principle why it should not lead to redress\nfounded in part on the claimant?s subjective anguish. And if such\nredress could be awarded where the chattel is destroyed or irretriev-\nably lost, it might also be awarded where the chattel continues to\n56\nexist but is no longer in the possession of the particular defendant.\nSuch an award might occur where a museum knowingly returns a\nborrowed work to its lender in open defiance of a legitimate third\nparty claim by a Holocaust survivor. The museum is liable to the\n57\nthird party in the tort of conversion, but there can of course be no\nquestion of specific restitution. Payments might extend both to the\nmarket value of the chattel and the emotional suffering inflicted on\n55\nTasmanian Aboriginal Centre v Natural History Museum (2007).\n56\nSuch a claim could not be brought before the Spoliation Advisory Panel\nbecause the Panel?s jurisdiction extends only to cultural objects ?now in the\npossession of a UK national collection or in the possession of another UK\nmuseum or gallery established for the public benefit?. Spoliation Advisory\nPanel, Constitution and Terms of Reference (Revised, June 2000) para 3 (empha-\nsis added). \n57\nMarcq v Christie Manson & Woods Ltd [2004] QB 286.\n38Emblems and Heirlooms\nthe true owner in consequence of the chattel?s being irretrievably lost.\nA similar result might be justified where the chattel has passed\nthrough the hands of successive buyers and re-sellers, all of whom\nhave committed conversion but none of whom has the current pos-\nsession of the chattel.\nSome of these ideas may appear fanciful. To the extent that they\nrelate to proceedings in court, they also turn on the precarious prem-\nise that the claimant retains the title to sue. In many instances that\nwill not be true because the limitation period will have expired. It\nmay be that in time a court will find ways of mitigating the effect of\ntime bars on Holocaust-related claims, though that prospect is uncer-\ntain. Such matters aside, it would seem fair to take account of the\npower of personal association in the structuring and resolving of\nHolocaust claims.\nIt was Mr Bernstein in Citizen Kane who reminded us of the fortu-\nitous nature of memory. Recalling a girl on the Jersey ferry, whom he\nhad glimpsed for only a second some forty years earlier, he said that\nnot a month had passed when he did not think of her.\nA fellow will remember a lot of things you wouldn?t think he?d\nremember. You take me. One day, back in 1896, I was crossing\nover to Jersey on the ferry. And as we pulled out, there was\nanother ferry pulling in, and on it there was a girl waiting to\nget off. A white dress she had on. She was carrying a white\nparasol. I only saw her for one second. She didn?t see me at all.\nBut I?ll bet a month hasn?t gone by since that I haven?t thought\n58\nof that girl.\nWe do not always appreciate, at the time they occur, those experi-\nences that will live in our thoughts. Nor can we foresee the memories\nthat will last for as long as we live. Where so much of a person?s past\nhas vanished through conflict or extermination, the simple things\nwhich echo that past should be treated as precious, and graced by\nformal recognition. Law and government should share in that recog-\nnition.\n58\nThe speech was delivered by the great actor Everett Sloane, playing Bern -\nstein.

Desperately looking for some blessed relief from the catalogues of exposure about the excesses of our elected representatives. And 'Blessed' is the word because all I can find is the report on page 19 of today's edition about a new book written by Father Ksawery Knotz, a celibate Polish priest. The book is titled 'Sex As You Don't Know It: For Married Couples Who Love God'.  Its described as advising couples to explore a 'saucy and fantasy-packed' love life.\n\nFather Knotz has written the 'Catholic Kama Sutra'.  Could it be an attempt to draw attention away from Dan Brown's new book which is due out in September.  Anyway he tells us that \"Every act - a type of caress, a sexual position with the goal of arousal is permitted and pleases God\". He goes on to say that \"During sexual intercourse, couples can show their love in every way, and offer one another the most sought after caresses\". And then he goes into the explicit detail.  We are not told whether this unique approach has increased the size of his congregations\n\nFather Knotz tells us that he compares sex with a football match. \"There are rules, for example you can't kick the ball out\".  Ouch. I suppose he favours a high scoring style of play. Even though he has no personal experience to call on, he tells us that he's learnt all his tricks from listening to the stories that couples have related to him. Well, that's it.  I suppose its back to wall-to-wall scandal and dodgy receipts tomorrow.

Pan ddisodlwyd yr hen systemau cymhorthdal gan y Taliad Sengl yn 2005, torrwyd y cyswllt rhwng taliadau PAC a chynhyrchiant, sy'n golygu nad oes yn rhaid i ffermwyr bellach orfod gynnal lefelau uchel o gynhyrchiant i gael cymhorthdal. Mae hyn yn eu galluogi i ganolbwyntio ar gynhyrchu'r hyn mae'r farchnad yn ei ddymuno ac i ffermio mewn ffordd eco-gyfeillgar. Mae Cynllun y Taliad Sengl yn dyrannu taliadau unwaith y flwyddyn, ar sail y cymorthdaliadau a dderbyniwyd, a'r tir a ddefnyddiwyd, rhwng 2000 a 2002.\n\nMae ffermwyr hefyd yn cael eu hannog i reoli eu tir mewn ffordd sy'n sensitif i'r amgylchedd drwy'r cynlluniau Tir Cynnal a Tir Gofal.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAmdanom ni\n\tPrif Weinidog Cymru\n\tEsbonio'r sefydliad\n\tCabinet a Gweinidogion\n\tGwasanaeth Sifil Llywodraeth Cymru\n\tRhaglen Lywodraethu\n\tHanes a ffeil ffeithiau\n\tRecriwtio\n\tYmchwil\n\n \n\tNewyddion\n\tY newyddion diweddaraf\n\tErthyglau\n\tDatganiadau\n\tBrÃ®ff i'r Lobi\n\n \n\n \n\n\tPynciau\n\tBusnes a'r economi\n\tPlant a phobl ifanc\n\tDiwylliant a chwaraeon\n\tAddysg a sgiliau\n\tYr amgylchedd a chefn gwlad\n\tCydraddoldeb ac amrywiaeth\n\tIechyd a gofal cymdeithasol\n\tTai a chymunedau\n\tGwella gwasanaethau cyhoeddus\n\tRhyngwladol\n\tLlywodraeth leol\n\tPobl hÅ·n\n\tCynllunio\n\tCyfiawnder cymdeithasol\n\tYstadegau\n\tDatblygu cynaliadwy\n\tTwristiaeth\n\tTrafnidiaeth\n\tY Gymraeg\n\n \n\n \n\n\tCyhoeddiadau\n\tRhyddid gwybodaeth\n\tSut i ddod o hyd i gyhoeddiad\n\tY Ganolfan Gyhoeddiadau\n\tY Cynllun Cyhoeddi\n\tCyswllt Gwybodaeth\n\tCylchlythyrau\n\n \n\tYmgynghori\n\tYmgynghoriadau ar y gweill\n\tYmgynhoriadau wedi dod i ben\n\tY broses o ymgynghori\n\tCylchlythyr ymgynghoriadau\n\n \n\n \n\n\tDeddfwriaeth\n\tRhaglen Ddeddfwriaethol 2011 - 2012\n\tIs-ddeddfwriaeth\n\tGorchmynion Trosglwyddo Swyddogaethau\n\tBiliau Senedd y DU\n\tArweiniad\n\tRefferendwm Cymru 2011\n\tYr Archifau Gwladol\n\tHynt Mesurau Seneddol y DU\n\n \n\tAriannu\n\tCyllidebau\n\tDiwygiad ariannol\n\tGrantiau\n\n \n\tYmgyrchoedd\n\tYmgyrchoedd eraill\n\tCyngor ar dywydd garw \n\n \n\n \n\n\nDilynwch ni ar-lein\n\n\t\n\nRSS\n\n\t\n\nTwitter\n\n\t\n\nFacebook\n\n\t\n\nFlickr\n\n\t\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\nNodweddion ychwanegol\n\nCofrestru\n\tcylchlythyrau\n\tfforymau\n\tsylwadau\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\nDatganiad Hawlfraint\n\n\t\nTelerau ac Amodau\n\n\t\nPolisi Preifatrwydd\n\n\t\nCynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru\n\n\t\nLlywodraeth yr Alban\n\n\t\nGweithrediaeth Gogledd Iwerddon\n\n\t\nDirectGov\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\n",

The ultimate goal is for them to be able to deal with the physical demands of their sport as well in the third round as they do in the first; to take a hit and to not be rocked by it.\nWe can often move on to the external loading work relatively quickly so once we?ve held next weekend?s camp in North Wales, a couple more in Cardiff and one with our female boxers, we?ll be able to start getting our future boxers into the Sport Wales National Centre and put these techniques into practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\n\n\n\n\nSport_Wales\n\n\n\n\nat\n05:20\n\n\n\nNo comments:\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n          \n\n          \n        \nTuesday, 29 November 2011\n\n\n          \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah's Kenya blog - day 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFRICAN ADVENTURE DAY 2: MONDAY 28TH NOVEMBER   19.49 GMT (22.49 Kenya time)\n\nJambo (as they say in Kenyan Swahili) or hi?..\nDay 2 started with Breakfast at 7.30am and just a plate of fruit for me!\n8am we met Mary from the British Council in Kenya who took us to meet her colleagues in the British Council offices just down the road from our Hotel. Lots of London 2012 posters and banners on display!! \nAfter a meeting with British Council staff  to finalise the programme it was a short walk across to The Upper Hill School to meet the delegates on the training. The Upper Hills school is a Government funded school that happens to be a boarding school in the business district of Nairobi (which does have boarders ? whom are on school holidays at the moment, however staff are in marking exams!!)\nAt 10am we started to meet the 25 course delegates who were more than welcoming. At 11am we started the course (having had to adapt our plan straight away as our equipment was ?STILL? in customs.\nOur day covered, ?getting to know you and what you?d like from the training sessions? which I led, followed by how to organise leagues, festivals and competitions. We then covered a session on the Cardiff City Supporters Trust followed by a football match!\nThe football match was amazing! We played on a VERY VERY wet, boggy and marshland rugby pitch (with no cones or equipment available to mark out a playing area) and no bibs available to determine the teams. It was soon sorted out that those in black and blue shirts would play those in bright colours. A lady delegate on the course - who happens to be a referee - took to the field, donning a lovely pink skirt. She managed the game very well ? even if she did call me off side a number of times!\nThe match was hilarious, especially as people hadn?t brought practical kit or clothing so were playing in their trousers and shoes! It was like playing on a skating rink, so slippy and slidy. It really was just what was needed after a heavy day in the classroom! The mud wouldn?t even come off with a good scrub in the shower!\nIt?s been a good day, the delegates on the course are very welcoming and engaging and it really does feel like I have known them for more than a day already! I am looking forward to tomorrow.\nIt?s now 11pm so I am off to bed ready for my 7am breakfast and our meeting with one of the Ministry departments tomorrow at 8am.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\n\n\n\n\nSport_Wales\n\n\n\n\nat\n01:52\n\n\n\nNo comments:\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nLabels:\nbritish council,\nnairobi,\nsport,\nupper hills school\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPORT WALES SUPPORTS KENYA'S NEW GENERATION OF COMMUNITY LEADERS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlog by Sport Wales' Sarah Roberts...\nCountdown = 1 day to go: \nWhen our Chief Executive Huw Jones initially sent round the email late in September asking if any staff would be interested in supporting the British Council on a project in Kenya, I immediately jumped at the chance and put my name forward. A week later I was asked by Huw if ?I had a minute? And could I see him in his office?? after my initial fear of ?oh my god, what have I done wrong!? I walked out chuffed that I?d been given such an opportunity to embark on.\nNow with only 1 day to go, I am both excited and apprehensive and desperately trying to sort out what clothes to take!! Typical girl thing I know!! Who will we be meeting? What will the weather be like? Will we join in with any sporting activity? Do I need to be smart and formal or relaxed and casual? Oh the dilemma!\nWhilst in Nairobi, we will launch a ?Football for All? project which has been developed by the British Council in partnership with Cardiff City Supporters Trust and is supported by the Welsh Football Trust, Urdd Gobaith Cymru, Cardiff City Football in the Community & Sport Wales.\nThe partnership is looking to achieve:\n·         A more cohesive, peaceful Kenya that will in turn translate to improved quality of life for communities involved\n·         Greater appreciation of sustainable development and interdependency of people and communities\n·         Increased power and decision making in the hands of the people\n·         And gender mainstreaming from grass roots levels.\nAll of which are fairly similar to what we are also trying to achieve in Wales!\nThe partners involved in the programme are:\n·         British Council ? (organising party) creating international opportunities for the people of the UK and other countries.\n·         Kenyan National Steering Committee ? with a mandate to co-ordinate all peace initiatives in the country and across borders.\n·         Kenyan National Cohesion & integration Commission who promote the elimination of all forms of discrimination and promote tolerance and understanding amongst Kenyans.\n·         Kenyan Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sport who work on Youth empowerment and engagement.\n·         Grassroots community based organisations ? Active Citizen Programme.\nThere are 21 delegates that will be taking part in the week-long programme (7 female and 14 male) with ages ranging from 21 to 48, and roles ranging from Community Volunteers, sports liaison officers, Civic Educators, Community mobilizers / peace builders,  football coaches and referees.\nCentral to the success of the project will be training young Kenyans in how to communicate with their own communities and how to influence local and national authorities to ensure sustainable, positive change, eventually establishing their first youth Parliament in Kenya, thus making their voice heard in decision making not just locally but on a country wide level. I am sure they will be very interested in the work that we are doing with Young Ambassadors in Wales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\n\n\n\n\nSport_Wales\n\n\n\n\nat\n01:39\n\n\n\nNo comments:\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n          \n\n          \n        \nSunday, 27 November 2011\n\n\n          \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSport Wales pay tribute to Gary Speed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Laura McAllister, Chair of Sport Wales, Welsh Football Trust Board Member and former Wales Women's international, has today paid tribute to Gary Speed:\n\n \n\n\"Everyone at Sport Wales' thoughts are with Gary's family and friends at this hugely difficult time. Gary was a truly fantastic role model for everyone in the world of football. \n\n\n\n\"The way he conducted himself as a player, coach and most recently as national manager was exemplary. His recent success as Wales manager was complemented by a unique commitment to developing the game at all levels, from grassroots to the national team, ensuring that football was truly a game for everyone. \n\n\n\nWe are deeply saddened by the news today and know he will be missed by everyone involved in sport in Wales.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\n\n\n\n\nSport_Wales\n\n\n\n\nat\n07:58\n\n\n\n1 comment:\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nLabels:\nfootball,\nGary Speed,\nlaura mcallister\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n          \n\n          \n        \nTuesday, 22 November 2011\n\n\n          \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYn ogystal Ã¢?m balchder amlwg i wrth wylio athletwyr Cymru a?n timau cenedlaethol ni?n cipio medalau a thlysau, gweld mwy o bobl yn cymryd rhan mewn chwaraeon ac yn dysgu am waith ysbrydoledig ein hyfforddwyr a?n gwirfoddolwyr ni yw un o fy hoff agweddau i ar fy rÃ´l i yn Chwaraeon Cymru. \nYng Ngwobrau Hyfforddwr y Flwyddyn Chwaraeon Cymru yng Nghaerdydd yn ddiweddar, cafwyd cyfle gwych i gyfarfod rhai unigolion eithriadol nodedig. Dyma?r bobl y mae eu gwaith nhw?n golygu ein bod ni?n gallu cynnig i blant eu blas cyntaf ar chwaraeon, bob cam drwodd hyd at roi sglein ar berfformiadau?r athletwyr hynny a fydd yn ennill medalau ym mhencampwriaethau?r byd. \nO bob cefndir mewn bywyd ac o bob cornel yng Nghymru, dyma?r bobl i?w dilyn a?u hefelychu. \nY llynedd, addawodd Chwaraeon Cymru, ochr yn ochr Ã¢?n partneriaid ni, i ddyblu nifer yr hyfforddwyr a?r gwirfoddolwyr yng Nghymru, o tua 110,000 i tua 250,000 erbyn 2016 ? tua 10% o?r boblogaeth. Mae?n darged hynod uchel ond yn un y gallwn ni ei gyrraedd yn fy marn i fel rhan o?n Gweledigaeth gyfan ni ar gyfer Chwaraeon. Mae ein gwaith ymchwil ni?n dangos bod 9% o oedolion yn dymuno gwirfoddoli?n amlach, felly mae?r ewyllys yn bodoli. \nFodd bynnag, rydw i?n teimlo bod y cynnydd wedi bod yn araf hyd yma. Mae?n rhaid i?r sector chwaraeon ? ac rydw i?n cynnwys Chwaraeon Cymru yn y sector ? godi ei gÃªm yn sylweddol.                  \nMae?n rhaid i?r dystiolaeth am y cynnydd sydd wedi?i wneud drwy waith yn cynyddu?r fyddin o wirfoddolwyr ddod yn amlycach yn awr. Nid ydym yn gweld datblygu hyfforddwyr a?r gweithlu chwaraeon yn cael y flaenoriaeth maent yn ei haeddu yn y sector ac mae hynny?n golygu y byddwn ni?n cael ein dal yn Ã´l gyda?n Gweledigaeth ar gyfer Chwaraeon. \nFel un enghraifft, mae nifer yr hyfforddwyr gweithredol yn ein cyrff rheoli cenedlaethol ni wedi cynyddu o 14,604 i 16,397 yn ystod y flwydddyn rhwng 2010 a 2011 ? cynnydd o 12%. Os ydym ni am gynnal y lefel honno o gynnydd dros gyfnod o bum mlynedd, byddai hynny?n golygu ein bod ni? sicrhau cynnydd o 60-65%, yn hytrach na?r cynnydd o 100% rydym ni wedi bod yn chwilio amdano. Wrth gwrs, nid dim ond ffigurau sy?n bwysig, ond hefyd y math o hyfforddwyr a?r lefel o hyfforddwyr rydym ni eu hangen, a ble maent yn cael eu defnyddio. Mae?n rhaid wrth ansawdd yn ogystal Ã¢ niferoedd, ond hoffwn gadarnhau fy nyhead i i?n gweld ni?n sicrhau cynnydd yn gynt.        \nGyda Llundain 2012 a Glasgow 2014 ar y gorwel, a hefyd Pencampwriaethau Athletau?r Byd sydd i?w cynnal yn Llundain yn 2017 yn dilyn cyhoeddiad diweddar, bydd plant a phobl ifanc yn arbennig yn dymuno efelychu eu harwyr yn y byd chwaraeon. Wedi perfformiad ardderchog Dai Greene ym Mhencampwriaethau Athletau?r Byd yr haf hwn, pan gipiodd fedal aur, derbyniodd ei glwb, sef clwb Harriers Abertawe, lawer o geisiadau gan ieuenctid a oedd yn dymuno dilyn yn Ã´l ei droed ar y trac, ac ymuno Ã¢?r clwb. \nFy her i i?r chwaraewyr allweddol yn y byd chwaraeon yng Nghymru yw, ydym ni?n barod i fanteisio ar y diddordeb hwn?\nRydym ni i gyd yn gwybod ein bod ni angen byddin o hyfforddwyr a gwirfoddolwyr sy?n fodlon gwneud yn siÅµr bod y profiadau cyntaf a gaiff plant mewn chwaraeon yn rhai cadarnhaol a hwyliog. Mae?n rhaid i ni ddechrau recriwtio nawr. \nMae llwybr taith gyfnewid y Fflam Olympaidd wedi cael ei gyhoeddi yn ddiweddar ac roeddwn i?n hynod falch o weld Cymru?n cael lle amlwg ar y llwybr, gan gynnwys taith i gopa?r Wyddfa.    \nRydw i wrth fy modd yn cael clywed am y gwahanol ddigwyddiadau cymunedol a fydd yn cael eu cynnal wrth i?r fflam deithio ar hyd a lled y wlad. Mae?n rhaid i ni i gyd gofio bod y cyfle i ddefnyddio grym yr achlysur hwn i annog mwy o bobl ifanc i gymryd rhan mewn chwaraeon yn gyfle y mae?n rhaid i bob un ohonom ni fanteisio arno. \nCeir sawl ffordd i bobl gymryd rhan ond, mewn nifer o achosion, mae?n rhaid i ni weithredu?n gynt yn hytrach nag yn hwyrach er mwyn osgoi cael ein gadael ar Ã´l. Er enghraifft, mae gan ysgolion hyd at Ragfyr 16eg i ymuno Ã¢ Rhwydwaith Get Set ? rhaglen addysgol swyddogol Llundain 2012. Drwy ymuno, gall ysgolion Cymru warantu cyfran o docynnau Olympaidd a Pharalympaidd i?w disgyblion.        \nEr hynny, mae?n fy mhryderu i mai dim ond ychydig dros 10% o ysgolion Cymru sydd wedi cofrestru?n llawn gyda?r cynllun hwn (ffigur o ddechrau mis Tachwedd). Mae hyn yn golygu y bydd llawer o?n plant ysgol ni?n colli cyfle gwych, gyda thocynnau?n cael eu rhannu ar hyd a lled y DU. Bydd disgybl o Loegr, yr Alban neu Ogledd Iwerddon yn gwylio digwyddiad yn fyw pan allai?r disgybl hwnnw fod wedi dod o ysgol yng Nghymru.  \nNi allwn ni adael i?r cyfle hwn fynd heibio heb grybwyll perfformiad ffantastig ein tÃ®m rygbi ni yng Nghwpan Rygbi?r Undeb y Byd. Cododd Warren Gatland a?i chwaraewyr a?i staff galonnau?r genedl gyfan, gan brofi bod gwaith caled ac ymroddiad yn talu ar ei ganfed.          \nDyma enghraifft eto o Gymru?n rhagori ar wledydd llawer mwy i ddangos ein bod ni?n genedl chwaraeon sy?n gallu cystadlu ar y lefel uchaf un.\nPan rydych chi?n gweld 60,000 o bobl yn Stadiwm y Mileniwm am 8.30am ar fore Sadwrn i wylio rygbi ar sgrin fawr, ni all unrhyw un ddadlau nad yw chwaraeon yn gyfrwng pwerus. \nRoeddwn i?n ddigon ffodus i weld rhai o Bencampwriaethau Boccia PF a gynhaliwyd yn y Ganolfan Genedlaethol yng Nghaerdydd ychydig wythnosau yn Ã´l. Daeth 36 o chwaraewyr gorau?r DU at ei gilydd yng Nghaerdydd i herio ei gilydd ar gyfer y teitl pwysig ? Pencampwr PF.\nYn y grÅµp BC2, enillodd Andrew Williams o?r Wyddgrug yng Ngogledd Cymru, yr aur gyda buddugoliaeth o 4-3 yn y rownd derfynol. Yn y dosbarth BC3, cipiodd Jacob Thomas o Sir Benfro fuddugoliaeth arall i Gymru ac enillodd Rhodri Tudor o Abertawe fedal efydd yn y gystadleuaeth BC1.

They are the people whose work means we can offer young kids their first taste of sport, right the way up to polishing the performances of those athletes who will win medals at world championships.\nFrom all walks of life and every corner of Wales, they are the people to follow and emulate.\nLast year Sport Wales, along with our partners, committed to doubling the number of coaches and volunteers in Wales, from around 110,000 to around 250,000 by 2016 ? around 10% of the population. It is a hugely aspirational target but one I believe we can meet as part of our whole Vision for Sport. Our research shows that 9% of adults would like to volunteer more often, so the will is there.\nHowever, I feel that progress has been too slow to date. The sporting sector ? and I include Sport Wales in that ? must up its game considerably.\nEvidence of the progress made through work to increase the volunteer base now needs to become more prominent. We are not seeing development of coaches and the sporting workforce being given the priority it deserves in the sector and that means we will be held back in our Vision for Sport.\nAs an example, the number of active coaches in our national governing bodies increased from 14,604 to 16,397 in the year from 2010 to 2011 ? an increase of 12%. If we maintain that level of increase over five years the progress would put us at about 60-65%, rather than the 100% increase we are looking for. Of course, it is not just about numbers but about the type and level of coaches we need and where they are deployed. It is quality as well as quantity, but I reinforce my desire for us to progress at pace.\nWith London 2012, Glasgow 2014 and the recently announced World Athletics Championships in London in 2017 just over the horizon, children and young people especially will want to copy their sporting heroes. Following Dai Greene?s magnificent performance and gold medal in the World Athletics Championships this summer, his Swansea Harriers club received lots of requests from youngsters wanting to follow in his footsteps on the track and join up.\nMy challenge to the key players in Welsh sport is, are we ready to capture this interest?\nWe all know we need an army of willing coaches and volunteers to make sure that children?s first experiences of sport is a positive, fun one. We need to start recruiting now. \nThe London 2012 torch relay route has recently been announced and I?m pleased to see that Wales features so prominently, including a trip to the top of Snowdon. \nI?ve been delighted to hear about the different community events that will be held as the torch travels through the country. We must all bear in mind that the opportunity to use the power of this event to encourage more young people to get involved in sport is one we must grasp.\nThere are numerous ways in which people can get involved, but in many cases we have to act sooner rather than later to avoid being left behind. For example, schools have until December 16th to join-up to the Get Set Network ? the official education programme for London 2012. By joining up, Welsh schools can guarantee a share of Olympic and Paralympic tickets for their pupils. \nHowever, it concerns me that only just over 10% of schools in Wales are fully signed up to this scheme (figure from early November). This means our schoolchildren will miss out, with tickets being shared out across the UK. A pupil from England, Scotland or Northern Ireland will be watching an event live when it could have been someone from a Welsh school.\nI could not let this opportunity go by without mentioning the fantastic performance of our team at the Rugby Union World Cup. Warren Gatland and his players and staff gave the nation such a lift and proved that hard work and dedication can bring rewards. \nWales again outmuscling much larger nations to show we are a sporting nation that can compete at the very top level.\nWhen you see 60,000 people in the Millennium Stadium at 8.30 on a Saturday morning to watch rugby on a big screen, no-one can dispute the impact of sport. \nI was lucky enough to see some of the GB Boccia Championships held at the National Centre in Cardiff a few weeks back. 36 of the best players in the UK converged on Cardiff to take each other on for the ultimate title ? GB Champion.\nIn the BC2 group, Andrew Williams from Mold, North Wales, took gold with a 4-3 final win. In the BC3 class, Jacob Thomas from Pembrokeshire grabbed another Welsh win, while Swansea?s Rhodri Tudor took a bronze in the BC1 event. Fantastic achievements and a credit to them and all those who have helped get them to this level. I look forward to seeing more of their achievements.\nMost recently, Andrew Selby and Fred Evans secured places on the boxing team for London 2012 ? two fighters on an Olympic team being another first for Wales.\nAs the countdown clock to Glasgow 2014 ticked under 1000 days to go, it reminded me of the targets and aspirations we have set for sport in Wales.\nI will not let us slip from our Vision to get every child hooked on sport for life and create a nation of champions. We must continually look to up our game, try new approaches and focus on what we need to do to be successful.\nCofion cynnes,\nLaura \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\n\n\n\n\nSport_Wales\n\n\n\n\nat\n01:36\n\n\n\nNo comments:\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n          \n\n          \n        \nMonday, 14 November 2011\n\n\n          \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchools should sign up, says Olympic medallist\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-times Olympic medallist, swimmer David Davies, explains why he thinks schools should sign up to the Get Set network:\n GET THE OLYMPICS BUZZ\n\nI?ve had two amazing experiences of Olympic Games. I competed well, was successful and managing to bring home medals. The best thing for me was standing on the medal rostrum and realising that all the hard work had paid off and I?ve got something to show for it. \n\t\n\tDavid Davies greets crowds in Wales after winning a silver medal at the Beijing Olympics.\n\n\n\n\nIt?s two weeks of everything you wanted to do and what you trained for.\nIf schools are able to tap into just 1% of the feeling that I had as I stood on that podium ? then it?s all worth it. \n\n\n\nGet Set ? the official London 2012 education programme for schools, colleges and local authority education providers ? gives schools the chance to get involved!\n\n\n\nIT PUTS A FOCUS ON SPORT\n\nSport is a fantastic thing for young people to develop not only sporting aspirations but people skills as well. Sport definitely develops you as a person. Get Set can encourage kids to adopt healthy, active lifestyles and to do something with their lives.\n ROLE MODELS\nI remember watching the 1992 Olympics. I wasn?t even watching the swimming, I saw Linford Christie win his 100m and Sally Gunnell win the 400m hurdles. And that ? for me ? was a massive deal. I thought , ?I want to do sport.? I wasn?t thinking of competing in an Olympics but it propelled me to want to give it a good go.\nIf kids are going to be watching it next year, role models will be built over night ? especially as it?s a home Games. We?ll host fantastic sporting events on our doorstep and thousands and thousands of kids might want to give it a go. And even if they don?t make it to the Olympics, it can still develop you as a person ? not just as a sportsperson.\nATHLETES MIGHT COME TO YOUR SCHOOL\nThe Get Set programme is providing opportunities to have visits from athletes and London 2012 mascots. I remember Ben Evans the rugby player coming to my school and I loved it! If you have children who don?t have sporty families or who don?t see much sport at home, this might be the only chance they get to see role models.\nLEARN THE VALUES\nSigning up to Get Set will mean that you find out more about the Olympic and Paralympic values (respect, excellence, friendship, courage, determination, inspiration and equality).\nGet Set is built around this and provides children with the chance to prove that they too can reflect the values in everyday life.\nTICKETS\nAnd, if you?re part of Get Set, you might even get a share of tickets for your school! If you?re going along, make sure you take lots of Welsh flags with you ? it?s really motivating to see lots of home support in the stands!\n\t\n\tWales' Olympians arrive home in Wales \n\n\n\n\nSo if you?re a teacher, please, please think about signing your school up to the Network. If you?re a student or parent ? ask if your school has signed up. If not, why not? There?s nothing to lose!

An hour earlier, Andrew Mitchell had resigned his post as Chief Whip. Mitchell had only just appointed a new spad, Meg Powell-Chandler, and he may have been planning to appoint another. Since spads? appointments are technically terminated when their appointing Minister leaves office, Powell-Chandler?s tenure was abruptly cut short.\n\nAndrew Mitchell?s replacement as Chief Whip is Sir George Young, who left the Cabinet only six weeks earlier. His return brings the possibility that Robert Riddell, his spad as Leader of the House (2010-12), will make a return to government. Young is unlikely to keep on Powell-Chandler or appoint anyone else, because the Chief Whip under Coalition has so far only taken on one on spad, giving the other ?slot? to their deputy from the partner party.\n\nSince the reshuffle, a couple of significant appointments have been made at the centre of government, with Oliver Dowden and Ryan Coetzee being brought in to the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister?s offices, Dowden as Deputy Chief of Staff And Coetzee as Clegg?s chief strategy spad.\n\nSome line departments now have more than two spads. Michael Gove and Iain Duncan-Smith now have three spads each. Another impending appointment means that BIS will now have four spads in the department: two for Vince Cable, two for the Conservative ?junior? ministers, Michael Fallon and David Willetts.\n\nJeremy Hunt has kept one of his spads from DCMS, Sue Beeby, and has agreed to appoint a second spad, Sam Talbot-Rice. Talbot-Rice is not included on Friday?s release because he had not started in his post. The Constitution Unit understands that he will take up his post on November 19 and will act as Hunt?s ?policy special adviser?. Chris Grayling (MOJ) and Maria Miller (DCMS) are two Secretaries of State likely to hire a second spad soon.\n\nBoth of Andrew Lansley?s spads at DH have left the government, unique among spads with reshuffled ministers. The only spad to leave their post without their minister being reshuffled was Bridget Harris. She was one of the six Lib Dem ?departmental? spads appointed to monitor developments across government, reporting to Nick Clegg.\n\nThree spads have moved to work for different ministers in different departments. Amy Fisher has moved from Defra to MOJ; Victoria Crawford from DFT to DFID; Guy Levin from DCMS to DFID. That is unusual: spads are usually personal appointments, and move with their minister.\n\nJonathan Caine is unique as spad to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. As predicted in a previous blog post, he is the only spad who has remained in a department in spite of a change of Secretary of State. That may be explained by his previous history: he was a spad in NIO under John Major for five years before being brought back in 2010. Arguably, he is an ?expert? spad.\n\nBut it is worth noting that the pending appointment in DH and BIS means that the Government will soon set a record for the number of spads in government. With fourteen joining and only ten leaving, the number of spads in post increased between July and October 2012 from 81 to 85. But the reported appointments at DBIS and DH as well as potential appointments in the Whips? office, MoJ and DCMS mean that the number of spads can be expected to reach 87 and perhaps as high as 90, topping the previous record of 85 spads in 2004 under Labour. The rise in numbers may be brought about by the fact of coalition (and the need for greater cross party interaction); and recognition of the need for more politically committed advice and assistance to Ministers. But it is also a product of the rise in the number of ministers in the Coalition Government?especially ministers attending Cabinet.\n\nLast weekend, the Public Administration Select Committee (PASC) published its report ?Special Advisers in the thick of it?. The Committee came out against a cap on the numbers of spads. That was sensible: the focus should be on the effectiveness of special advisers, not their numbers. Spads are here to stay, and the sooner we have a dispassionate and informed debate about their role, the better. But whether or not the public and Westminster observers will agree is a different matter.\n\nMH\n\n[This post was edited on 23/10/12 to take account of Coalition practice in appointing spads to whips.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFiled under Coalition Government, Special Advisers, Uncategorized\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTagged with Cabinet Office, coalition government, constitution, David Cameron, Nick Clegg, PASC, reshuffle, Spads, special advisers, The Thick of It, Whitehall\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGoats were thrown to the Wolves under?Labour\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 10, 2011\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby Constitution Unit\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeave a comment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPress Release: Goats were thrown to the Wolves under Labour\n\n\n\nThe experience under Labour of appointing some ministers from outside Parliament suggests no easy answer to a new call from MPs to reduce the number of ministers in the so-called ? payroll vote? in the Commons. The recommendation is made today (Thursday 10 March) in a report, ?Smaller Government: What Should Ministers do?? by the Commons Public Administration Select Committee.\n\nIn the last Labour government, ministers appointed from outside Parliament were given little or no induction and many of them were critical of the lack of clear delegation or objectives. The result was sheer overload?one former minister describing office as ?the most exhausting job I?d ever done. It was relentless.?\n\nThis is the main finding of the Constitution Unit?s report Putting Goats amongst the Wolves: Appointing Ministers from outside Parliament just published. The study takes its starting point Gordon Brown?s decision to appoint half a dozen Ministers from outside Parliament in order to build a ?government of all the talents? ? leading such Ministers to be called ?Goats?. The study set out to explore the arguments for appointing ministers from outside Parliament, and to study the experience of such appointees.\n\nDr Ben Yong, co-author of the report along with Professor Robert Hazell says: ?Under the coalition, there are currently only a small number of ?outsider ministers? in the Lords, and it seems unlikely that David Cameron will make more appointments in the numbers seen under Gordon Brown.?\n\nYong adds: ?More thought needs to be given to what ministers can realistically be expected to do, and what they should not do. We have been told of ministerial overload, while on the other hand, former ministers such as Chris Mullin have talked of ?empty? ministerial posts. The need to define more clearly the functions of junior ministers especially has become even more pressing, given the government?s plan to reduce the number of MPs from 650 to 600. In such circumstances, will it still be necessary to have 123 ministers, or one-fifth of Parliament in government??\n\nThe report was funded by Peter Scott QC.

We are currently working out different ways of doing it and the power of human endeavour will start it off.\n\n        \"There's a huge amount of pressure on the athletes. We are in a really good place and it is going to be the best Paralympic Games we have ever seen. I think we do very well by having the Games afterwards and the uniqueness of our own torch relay is also important.\" \n\n  Torch design\n\t      The torch was created by London-based designers Edward Barber and Jay Osgerby, who were also behind the Olympic torch. They said it was driven by a desire to reflect modernity and innovation.\n\n  \n  \n\n    The torch's journey will begin and end in London\n  \n\n      It is made from an aluminium alloy - light while being strong and heat resistant. \n\n        Cutting-edge laser technology has been used to create thousands of round perforations which will help ensure that heat from the flame is quickly dissipated without being conducted down the handle.\n\n        The holes also make the torch lighter and give it a strong texture that is easy to grip. \n\n        The colour of the mirrored-finish should mean that the teams of torchbearers will not be lost in the darkness on the overnight stretch of the relay. \n\n        London 2012 chairman Lord Coe said: \"With six months to go we are on track to deliver a great Games that will showcase some of the most inspirational athletes from around the world.\n\n        \"The torch relay will provide the perfect start by involving people from across the UK in events celebrating the flame and help to ignite passion for the Paralympics.\"\n\n        A flame lighting event in London will kick off the relay before Belfast stages the second lighting event  and the first of the four evening Flame Festivals on 25 August.\n\n        Edinburgh on 26 August and Cardiff on 27 August will be the next two host cities before the four flames come together in Stoke Mandeville the following day, where they will be combined to create the London 2012 Paralympic Flame..\n\n  \n\tContinue reading the main story\t\tPARALYMPIC RELAY FACTS\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t First torch relay - Seoul Olympics, 1988 with 111 disabled people among the 282 torchbearers \n\t The relay has been part of each Paralympics since then\n\t By Sydney 2000 there were 920 torchbearers and the flame was lit during an Aboriginal lighting ceremony\n\t In Salt Lake City 2002, Eric Weihenmeyer, the first blind man to climb Everest, carried the torch to the podium of the stadium \n\t For Athens 2004 the Paralympic Flame was lit in the Hephaestus Temple and 680 torchbearers took part\n\t Beijing 2008's flame was lit in the Temple of Heaven with 850 torchbearers carrying the torch along two routes, split between ancient and modern China\n\t Beijing's Paralympics in 2008 had 3,951 athletes from 146 countries\n\t Paralympics is short for Parallel Olympics\n\n\n\t\n\t\n      The English communities which have been chosen to host flame celebrations will send representatives to the opening event in London.\n\n        Once there they will each collect part of the flame in a lantern and transport it back to their home towns to be used at their individual events.\n\n        National representatives will attend the lighting ceremonies in Belfast, Edinburgh and Cardiff and take part of the flame from their respective capital.\n\n        Flame celebrations will be staged in the following places:\n\n        ENGLAND North East: Beamish.

Mae’r Bwrdd o’r farn ei bod yn briodol ac yn rhesymol ymarferol i Ofcom sicrhau, wrth weithredu’r swyddogaeth hon, bod darparwyr radio yng Nghymru yn cynnig darpariaeth Gymraeg mewn achosion priodol.\n\n2.3\n\nMae Adran 314(7) Deddf Cyfathrebiadau 2003 (DC 2003) yn diffinio ‘deunydd lleol’ y mae gofyn i ddarlledwyr radio ei gynnig.

A bit later than the original post sorry, but even with translation help, these things take time to do.\n\n[Grammatical Health Warning: this blog post was translated from this original Welsh language post using Google Translate as a tool to speed up the process. Subsequently, some of the phrasing and expressions may be a bit wonky. I hope that the wonkiness doesn't affect the communication of the ideas too much.]\n\nSaturday before last I went to Theatr Felinfach after being invited to give some ideas about the future of S4C in the digital context. I did not want to be so bold as to offer a full manifesto but rather to raise questions that could feed into further discussion. The article written by Euros on Click on Wales notes that I focus on the idea that more young people use social networks than television, but I felt that my message was a little different. I thought it was best to publish what I said anyway, in case there was some wider value to it. I’d be delighted to hear any comments.\n\nSet a few challenges, raise some questions\n\nI’m not trying to offer solutions to the business of producing television programs. There are plenty of other people who have long experience of the industry that can do that so much better. But I want to set some challenges or raise some questions of the Welsh broadcast system from the perspective of the enormous changes to every aspect of our lives brought about by the advent of the internet , and especially the way it has disrupted media business models as they had been developed up until the turn of the last century.\n\nOnline media is an integral part of the media landscape today. This is not the for the Welsh and particularly Welsh language media. Yet. How can we change that?\n\n\tWelsh developments in the field has been hampered until now\n\tthere is institutional inertia across all Welsh language media providers (and arguably English language media providers in Wales)\n\tnot enough is being done to streamline arrangements so that it can adapt to the needs of digital media and the audience that is ready for it\n\n\nDo we need more TV companies or a stronger digital sector?\n\n\tthe digital media sector is very weak, and exists mainly as poorly funded wings of companies whose main focus is other media/creative industries\n\tS4C has a role in growing the digital media sector\n\tif we want a dynamic media we have to develop companies that can adapt to produce for online\n\n\nDo we need a comprehensive S4C.com or S4C as a digital brand across the internet and an investor in others?\n\n\ttrying to create one Welsh-language portal is a folly. Trying to compete as a homepage with the force of the BBC is impossible.\n\tBetter to try to spread the S4C brand across the web and across where audiences gather. Working diagonally rather than vertically.\n\tCan begin to do this by creating a steady stream of investment for content and services online\n\n\nCan S4C take the role of enabling and investment rather than commissioning?\n\n\tare commissioners the right people to make decisions about the value of certain types of media in the age of the internet?\n\tPerhaps S4C can begin using new arm’s length models to invest in projects slowly\n\tThere is no need to fund long online series to fill a schedule. Series can be developed incrementally and at their own pace.\n\tIt’s one thing to say they will promote the dreaded UGC, or unpaid content, on their website, but there’s no mention of trying to invest in anyone or any structures to help create that UGC\n\n\nHow can an organization like S4C change from one of grand actions to being an organization of small actions as well?\n\n\tMaybe only 200 pounds is needed to start a small project online. Is it possible to develop a model to germinate media. Investing small, and invest more when they see success?\n\tModels like this are totally alien to S4C but many of the successes of the web have grown from small beginnings.\n\tIf a success is on the cards, then broadcast platforms can boost it through harnessing broadcasts ability to speed up attention\n\n\nAre there are ways of freeing up online content?\n\n\tThere is an urgent need to begin negotiations to ensure that Welsh material can have the freedom and conditions favorable to be distributed on-line\n\tThere is a need to re-examine the terms of trade for online content in Welsh\n\t TAC / Equity / MU etc agreements were designed for the end of the analogue age. They are long overdue a re-assessment.\n\tThinking about how it is possible free up certain types of products online so that it can be re-used. Creative Commons licenses is one possibility. A new balance between fair royalties and the freedom to create, remix and share is essential.\n\n\nHow Can S4C provide a space to experiment, fail, explore new methods of production?\n\n\tno one has a map for making the most of opportunities and challenges of media as it stands. We must therefore create a space in which to feel our way and see what works in Welsh\n\n\nIf we want to create new forms of civic value, we need to improve the ability of small groups to try radical things…our best chance for finding good ideas is to have as many groups as possible try as many things as possible.\n\nClay Shirky\n\n\nHow can S4C think beyond mainstream television whilst continuing to produce mainstream television?\n\n\tnot the displacemen of one technology / medium with another, but adding media upon media that will work together in new and complex ways\n\tlinear TV is still vitally important, but we must make enough space for the rest to breathe and develop\n\n\nIs there a prime means of creating a Welsh media on the internet?\n\n\twe must try to find what works for us as Welsh speakers.\n\tThe possibilities are endless, but almost nothing had been examined. Too often we simulate the Anglo-American models.\n\n\nHow can digital S4C help build an audience?\n\n\tin the same way that S4C had to build a Welsh language audience for its new channel in 1982, we must build an audience for online material in Welsh\n\n\nCriticizing present realities is important but insufficient. It can be hard to picture what the future would look like, and so to be making things, as examples of future creative diversity, in the here and now, offers a powerful and tangible form of inspiration to others – and challenges the apparent inevitability of the present.\n\nDavid Gauntlett\n\n\n\tthe number of examples of online services in Welsh is limited. Without good examples, how to create the necessary continuity, the positive feedback loop?\n\tS4C has a big role to play in promoting others who do work that matches their brief of providing Welsh public service media\n\tI’m not talking of media literacy lessons here but trying to develop people with enthusiasm and energy to try something and drive them forward through encouragement and perhaps developmental innovations such as intensive technology courses. eg http://www.apdyfrig.com/2011/02/17/awydd-gwneud-cwrs-dwys-24-awr-mewn-technoleg-newydd/\n\n\nAre we doing enough to be part of IPTV?\n\n\tdevelop apps with new IPTV commercial funding\n\tsecure the place of Welsh television and interactivity within  IPTV, specifically with YouView\n\n\nS4C is a purposeful intervention in the television market in order to be a tool in the survival of the Welsh language. The media has changed so much, you need a new kind of interference?\n\n\tit must be understood that although figures may be much lower than television users at present, that intervention in the online media market is crucial now\n\tWelsh production companies and individuals within those companies already doing much more than S4C to try to push online services, but are held back.\n\n\nHow can S4C create a closer, more honest connection between itself and its audience/users?\n\n\tA natural gap has existed between the television audience and producers in the one to many model. It will not be easy to change this type of organizational relationship.\n\tSo it may be better to leave it and focus entirely on trying to jump over television to the creation of other services that may overlap with TV, and that can reduce that gap\n\tIn order to do this, you might have to create these services outside of S4C as an institution / channel altogether.\n\tS4C is in a comfort zone in terms of broadcasting. Intervention must be created that will force them to come out of this.\n\n\nIs S4C as a broadcaster a suitable structure for online media and new methods of co-creation?\n\n\tS4C has had almost 30 years to grow. It has perhaps over-grown as an institution (not in terms of content, I hasten to add).\n\tIt has not grown to do more than one thing. It has grown up around one thing: mass television broadcasting.\n\tI would argue that S4C (and not the S4C Authority) does not have the ability within the organization to adapt.\n\tSo I would argue that there exists a need to create a small body / company, under the Authority who can be a means to implement policies and aspirations that are non-televisual in nature .\n\tThis sister body needs to be a way of educating S4C and work across all of the channel’s activities and other bodies in the same way.\n\tI do not think either that there is sufficient expertise within the channel. Nobody is responsible for strategy or online content in particular. There are people who operate those elements, but they have no power, no cross-departmental brief, with a basis in content.\n\tTake a look what  ​​the Basque broadcaster EITB did : re-assessing every post in the channel in order to incorporate online; appoint a head of dept.  for online\n\n\nIt must create partnerships – but what kind of partnerships and what will they cost?\n\n\tS4C is and island. It has been an island for over a decade. We need to zoom out and see S4C as an archipelago of islands (as it was to start?).\n\tin a digital age it does not make sense to have digital publishing funds issued by the Council books, funding for technology development by the Language Board and funding resources online education by the assembly government department. All apart, and none cooperating.\n\tIs there a way to re-assess the gross funds available for digital material in Welsh and to co-manage it with a strategy between S4C and other Welsh commissioning / grant-giving / contracting institutions.\n\tThis is not easy – partnering on projects is sometimes  as difficult as pulling teeth to organizations that have rusted to the ground. It must find some sort of institutional WD40. I don’t know what (or maybe who) that is yet, but we need something to be a buffer when well-established institutions come head to head to cooperate.\n\n\nSo those were the points I made. Thanks to Eurosfor the impetus to put them together for an event. There was a good crowd, and I thought that the students there had  very interesting ideas.\n\nI’m not absolutely certain about the validity of all of the above points, but I think they are worth discussing, and hope they can instigate discussion. It would be great to hear your comments, if you agree or disagree with anything.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFiled under Barn, Cynhyrchu, Diwydiant, English, Syniadau\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 0\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t03/06/2011 / Rhodri ap Dyfrig\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t Yr Urdd mewn lluniau o Twitter (prawf)\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tO’n i jest isio gweld sut oedd rhai o nodweddion Storify yn gweithio ar flog WordPress, felly dyma chi go arni.\n\n\n[View the story \"Detholiad o luniau gorau wythnos yr Urdd ar Twitter\" on Storify]\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFiled under Cyffredinol, Cyfranogiad, Cymraeg\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 1\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t24/05/2011 / Rhodri ap Dyfrig\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t Comparing minority languages and lesser used languages on the internet\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI’m currently reading Minority Languages on the Internet: Promoting the regional languages of Spain by Peter Gerrand. It’s one of the only books that focuses primarily on the minority language on the internet from a language planning perspective rather than a more descriptive linguistic approach. His main focus is the policies implemented by the Basque, Catalan and Galician autonomous communities to promote and sustain their languages on the internet.\n\nI just wanted to quote a thought provoking paragraph from the conclusion of  his chapter outlining the role of minority language in an Internet dominated by English:\n\nOn the internet, the challenges for minority languages are the same as for the lesser-used national languages such as Dutch, Czech and Norwegian: how to enhance their prestige, and avoid domain loss. Language prestige cannot be achieved without language visibility. And so it is in the interests of linguistic survival to ensure a growing amount of communication in that language on the Internet, and to ensure that the language’s online resources are not ignored by the Internet’s search tools and addressing scheme. (Gerrand, 2007:45)\n\n\nWhat this suggests to me and my current work, and this is something that I’ve been thinking about already especially in relation to French and their relationship with English on the internet, is that comparisons of Welsh and Norwegian, Danish or Dutch could provide many interesting insights in terms of approaches to language issues and planning on the internet, particularly from the perspective of media and participation. After all, Norwegian and Dutch internauts have the same ‘internet diglossia’ problem as Welsh speakers have. You could argue that we are all diglossic with English on the internet, even though the internet now has become much more multilingual. Some would say that there are parallel internets and that the walls between the languages are too high to be  able to use the diglossia analogy. Whatever the description, the Norwegians and the Dutch alike are having to think about how their language can have an even playing field in a globalised media environment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFiled under Cyfranogiad, English, Ieithoedd, Syniadau\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 7\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t23/05/2011 / Rhodri ap Dyfrig\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t Wikipedia, iaith a lefelau cydweithio/cyfranogiad\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWrth edrych am y ffigyrau cyfredol am niferoedd defnyddwyr Wicipedia (neu Wikipedia Cymraeg), meddyliais y byddai’n werth jest rhoi snapshot yn cymharu sawl iaith sy’n leiafrifol, rhanbarthol neu ddim yn iaith gwladwriaeth (gan gynnwys Esperanto am laff!).

Fel rhyw fath o ffon fesur dyma ‘ddyfnder’ rhai Wikipedias eraill: Saesneg: 603; Ffrangeg: 143; Iseldireg: 31; Pwyleg: 13.\n\nUn cwestiwn dwi’n meddwl amdano heddiw ydi beth ydi’r gwahaniaeth rhwng iaith ar y rhyngrwyd sydd â diglossia gyda Saesneg, a iaith sydd gyda diglossia gyda iaith arall; ac i ba raddau mae hyn yn effeithio ar lefel a natur y cydweithio/cyfranogiad. Fy rhagdybiad oedd bod Saesneg yn parhau yn iaith ddominyddol ar y rhyngrwyd, a bod siaradwyr Cymraeg a Gwyddeleg, dyweder, yn llai tebygol o ddefnyddio’r rhyngrwyd yn eu hiaith na siaradwyr Basgeg neu Galisieg. Wrth gwrs mae hyni gyd yn gor symleiddio’n llwyr, ond mae’n ddiddorol gweld beth yw’r lefel cyfranogiad.\n\nMae gan y Basgwyr dros ddwy waith yn fwy o ddefnyddwyr bwyiog na’r Gymraeg, ond eto, mae ‘dyfnder’ y cyfraniadau yn llai. Fodd bynnag gan bod y nifer o ddelweddau yn y Wikipedia Basgeg yn y tabl yn 1, sydd yn methu bod yn gywir, dwi’n amau bod eu ffigwr ‘dyfnder’ wedyn yn anghywir hefyd.\n\nO bosib, gellid tynnu o hyn bod rhyw fantais yn dod i’r amlwg i ieithoedd sydd â diglossia gyda Saesneg yn achos Wikipedia. Am eu bod yn rhannu iaith gyda’r iaith fwyaf ar Wikipedia yn gyffredinol (a’r iaith weinyddol ar lefel uchaf Wikipedia), mae ychydig o’r bywiogrwydd hynny yn tollti drosodd i’r ieithoedd hynny. Bosib bod y gymuned Wikipedia ym Mhrydain, Iwerddon a’r UDA yn gryfach o ganlyniad i’r ffaith bod y Saesneg dal yn dominyddu’r wefan. Wn i ddim os yw hyn yn cyfri fel effaith bositif i diglossia gyda Saesneg am unwaith! Mae’n dibynnu os taw ‘gwerth’ neu ‘nifer’ yw eich meini prawf chi wrth gwrs. O bosib bod mwy o angen (efallai oherwydd diffyg adnoddau eraill) am nifer mwy o erthyglau mewn un iaith na’r llall hefyd.\n\nEfallai hefyd bod y tebygolrwydd o gael erthygl gyfatebol, well a mwy trwyadl, yn Saesneg yn golygu bod llai o gynhyrchu erthgylau stwbyn, a rhoi mwy o gig ar erthyglau.

That means that data can be linked with other relevant repositories and speak for itself. A search between “US government” and “military contractors” could reveal who might have a conflict of interest when going to war, for instance. Remember in late 2001, when KBR, a Halliburton subsidiary, was granted a 10-year contract wherever US troops went? A network analysis tool at the time might have made the ties between KBR and vice-president Cheney clearer.\n\n\nEnghraifft ddiddorol o dorfoli dwi’n meddwl a mae wastad yn braf gweld arloesedd o’r fath yn deillio o’r tu allan i’r UDA.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFiled under Cymraeg, Torfoli\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 0\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t03/04/2011 / Rhodri ap Dyfrig\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t Cyflwyniad ‘Cymanfa Ddychmygu S4C Newydd’, Theatr Felinfach\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDdydd Sadwrn cyn diwethaf bûm i yn Theatr Felinfach ar ol cael gwahoddiad i roi rhai syniadau am ddyfodol S4C yn y cyd-destun digidol.

I thought it high time that I gave a quick explanation of what it is and who’s behind it in English so that curious non-Welsh speakers could maybe chip in with any comments or questions you have on the service.\n\nI’ve given the full background detail to the project on the Welsh language post so maybe a Google Translation will have to suffice if you want the details, but in short Luistxo Fernandez a web developer for CodeSyntax in Eibar, in the Basque Country, contacted me to ask if I wanted to collaborate on developing a Welsh language version of their already operational Basque and Catalan tweet aggregators. I was only too happy to oblige seeing as my current job is study towards a PhD looking at online participatory culture and the Welsh language. Serendipity is a wonderful thing.\n\nWhat does Umap do?\n\nUmap Cymraeg does several things:\n\n\tit collects a database of Twitter users that have used Welsh in their tweets (or have the potential to do so). Manually initially, but then the system begins to add users by itself;\n\tit filters the tweets by these users for ones that are in Welsh, then publishes them on the main page;\n\tit filters this stream of tweets for popular words and hashtags and creates hourly/daily/weekly/monthly top trending topics lists\n\tit filters the links in Welsh language tweets to discover what links are most popular, giving a dynamic top news/shared links chart\n\n\nHow accurate is it?\n\nAt present, from rough calculations and mere obvservation it seems that it recognises about 60-65% of Welsh language tweets. Problems arise when tweets are short or where there is a mixture of Welsh and another language. It is however very good at not publishing tweets which aren’t in Welsh, with relatively few English only tweets coming through. I hope that we can improve this rate as we go on but it seems that even this rate is acceptable in providing an overview of the public discussion in Welsh.\n\nWhy is Umap needed?\n\nSome may not quite see the point of duplicating content from Twitter, but the aim is to provide a space in which Welsh tweets are seen in context with each other, rather than in a sea of other content. Umap creates a distinct Welsh language space out of a very complex and busy twitter stream.\n\nApart from the ability to be able to dip in to a monolingual Welsh Twitter, this has several other spinoff advantages:\n\n\tThis is he first time that trends amongst Welsh language tweets have been identified. From a mapping perspective alone this is useful, but it can also be harnessed for marketing, discovery, brand /news monitoring and other uses.\n\tUmap’s top news/links feed creates a new and unique way of seeing what the conversation is about at any moment in time. No service has previously been able to automatically gauge what is making waves online in the Welsh language. Of course it can also show that little is shared, or that the range of things that are shared in Welsh are limited, but this is great for building a better discussion in the Welsh language. Spot the gaps, and we can then find ways to fill them.\n\tUmap can work as a first point of contact for new Twitter users who wish to discover other Welsh speakers. There are now over 1,000 users being followed with the top 50 busiest ranked on a page. This is already being used as a signpost to where the Welsh language conversation is at.\n\tUmap can be built upon. All published tweets are archived and searchable. Twitter displays them for a limited time. Umap displays them until there is not enough space for them all. This archive is easily searchable and could be valuable as a research tool or as a corpus of informal Welsh language usage. In future I hope that it will be possible for developers to use this data for secondary applications of all sorts. After all, one of the great things about Twitter is that services like Umap can be built on top of it, allowing for many innovations.\n\n\nLastly, I want to point out again that Umap has been developed by Luistxo Fernandez’s team in CodeSyntax, with a little help on the Welsh version from me. If you have an idea about using Umap’s engine for other languages or groups of Twitter users (including English) then please get in touch with them.\n\nAs I said above, serendipity is a wonderful thing – Umap Cymraeg tries to make serendipity a wonderful thing that happens more often in the Welsh language.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFiled under Cyffredinol, Cyfranogiad, English, Umap\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 4\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t← Older\n\n\t\t\tNewer →\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\tSylwadau\n\tRhodri ap Dyfrig on FIDEO / VIDEO: Cynhadledd NPLD / S4C Conference 2011\n\tCarl Morris on FIDEO / VIDEO: Cynhadledd NPLD / S4C Conference 2011\n\tRising Voices » Languages: Content Aggregation For Underrepresented Voices on Umap Cymraeg: the story so far\n\tHowlsedhes Services on Why haven’t Welsh speakers taken to Foursquare?\n\tRhodri ap Dyfrig on Why haven’t Welsh speakers taken to Foursquare?\n\n\n\tFi\n\n\t\tFacebook\n\tFlickr\n\tLinkedIn\n\tTwitter\n\tYouTube\n\n\n\n\tGwefannau\n\n\t\tAnturiaethau yn y Jyngl\n\tCaff1\n\tD@flog\n\tDatblogu\n\tfideobobdydd\n\tGwenu Dan Fysiau\n\tHacio'r Iaith (blog)\n\tMaes-e\n\tMeddal\n\tPethau Bychain\n\tProsiect Teliesyn\n\tQuixotic Quisling\n\tRadio Amgen\n\tY Bydysawd\n\tY Lle\n\tY Twll\n\tYn y Ffrâm\n\n\n\n\tNoddwyr\n\n\t\tCronfa Cymdeithasol Ewrop (ESF)\n\tKESS\n\tPrifysgol Aberystwyth\n\tYr Ymddiriedolaeth Ddarlledu Gymreig\n\n\n\n\tPynciau\n\t\t\tBarn\n\n\tblogio byw\n\n\tCydweithio\n\n\tCyffredinol\n\n\tCyfranogiad\n\n\tCymraeg\n\n\tCynhyrchu\n\n\tDiwydiant\n\n\tEnglish\n\n\tIeithoedd\n\n\tProcrastineiddio\n\n\tSyniadau\n\n\tTorfoli\n\n\tUmap\n\n\tYmchwil\n\n\tYsgrifennu\n\n\n\n\n\tMeta\n\t\t\t\tLog in\n\tEntries RSS\n\tComments RSS\n\tWordPress.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPaperpunch Theme by The Theme Foundry.

We are talking about the overall method of computing\ntaxable profits.\n\nA valid basis\n\nA valid basis is one that computes the full amount of profits\n(ICTA88/S60 and ICTA88/S70) by using:\n\n\tGAAP,\n\n\n\nand\n\n\n\n\tcomplying with the principles of tax law\nas interpreted by the courts, \nBIM31003.\n\n\nA valid basis includes a basis of accounting where agreed\nadjustments are made in the tax computation in accordance with HMRC\npractice and current interpretation of the law. This will include\nadjustments made to exclude capital items such as depreciation. It\ncould also, for example, include an amendment made as a result of\nthe operation of an ESC or SP. So a valid basis would accord with\nthe law or practice applicable to that period of account.\n\n\n\nFor accounting periods commencing after 6 April 1999 Schedule\nD Cases I and II profits have to be computed in accordance with UK\nGAAP, subject to any adjustment required by law. So any computation\nmethod that did not follow UK GAAP, where there was not a tax law\noverride, would be an invalid basis. For accounting periods before\nthis the basis for computation was accounts prepared in accordance\nwith ordinary principles of commercial accountancy.\n\n\n\nIn addition a valid basis will correctly reflect the facts.\nThere is a general principle in the law that where facts are\navailable they are to be preferred to prophecies. This is sometimes\ncalled the Bwllfa principle, from the well-known case of Bwllfa and\nMerthyr Dare Steam Collieries (1891) Ltd. v Pontypridd Waterworks\nCo. [1903] A.C.426.\n\nAn invalid basis\n\nAn invalid basis is one that does not meet these standards of\nacceptability. An invalid basis of computing taxable profits is one\nthat is not in accordance with either the law or practice.\n\n\n\nFor example there are only two acceptable methods of valuing\nstock (excluding work in progress), (1) the lower of cost and net\nrealisable value, and (2) for certain financial instruments mark to\nmarket value. All other methods are not acceptable and are invalid\nbases.\n\n\n\nAny method that did not pay sufficient attention to the facts\nwould also be an invalid basis.\n\n\n\nThe change of basis legislation in FA98 and FA02 only applies\nwhere there is a change of basis from valid to valid. It does not\napply if the change is from invalid to valid, where the rule in \nBIM34030 applies.\n\nPrior period adjustments\n\nPrior period adjustments appear in accounts where there is a\nchange in accounting policy or to correct a fundamental error in\nthe previous accounts. Where accounts have a prior period\nadjustment for a fundamental error, the previous accounts may have\nbeen computed on an invalid basis.\n\nTax computation adjustments to a valid basis\n\nThe HMRC view is that where an accounting policy, which is a\nvalid basis for tax purposes, has been adopted in a trader?s\naccounts a different basis cannot then be adopted in computing the\nprofits figure to be entered on his tax return.\n\n\n\nIn Johnston v Britannia Airways [1994] 67TC99 Knox J\nsaid:\n\n\n\n'Which of the three ways in which the\nattribution of cost to a period or periods of accounting is adopted\nis, in my view, essentially a matter of accountancy judgement, and\nI am quite unable to detect any legal basis for excluding any of\nthem.'\n\n\n\n\nAdmittedly in that case the Special Commissioners had expressed\na preference for the method actually adopted by the, trader but\nthat was not the basis of their decision.\n\n\n\nIt follows that it is only where the accounting policy used\nin the accounts is an invalid basis for tax purposes that tax\nadjustments to the accounting policy should be made. An example of\nthis would be an entity that chooses to adopt IAS41: Agriculture\nfor its accounts before it is within UK GAAP. A tax adjustment\nshould be made to comply with SSAP9 - the UK GAAP relevant\naccounting standard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nHome|Main Contents|Manual Contents\n\n\n\t\n\nPrevious Page|Next Page|Top|Menu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n?\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n        \t\t?

That is, the SAO is responsible for taking reasonable steps to ensure that the company establishes and maintains appropriate tax accounting arrangements.\n\nA Customer Relationship Manager (CRM) must ask about the tax accounting arrangements as part of ongoing discussions to understand how the company approaches the task of ensuring tax liabilities are calculated accurately.\n\nSuch a discussion might cover the overall accounting arrangements within the company.  For example, it might explore\n\n\tthe nature of the business-wide policies, processes, reviewing and reporting undertaken, and\n\thow the SAO or company identify or are alerted to areas of the accounting arrangements that might present or mitigate a tax compliance risk.\n\n\nIn the course of such a discussion a CRM can learn the steps that are being taken within the company to establish and maintain the tax accounting arrangements.  The CRM should be prepared to discuss the tax treatment of particular items with the company so that the company can put in place the tax accounting arrangements and apply that treatment.  However, it remains the responsibility of the SAO to establish whether or not the company had appropriate tax accounting arrangements throughout the financial year. \n\nWhether the resultant certificate is qualified or unqualified, the certificate by itself will not necessarily mean that the SAO has failed in their main duty.  Where the CRM enters into further discussion, if the discussion is prompted by the content of that certificate, this will inform the CRM?s view as to\n\n\twhether the SAO has failed in his main duty, see SAOG14000, and\n\twhether the certificate, see SAOG15000, the SAO has submitted is accurate. \n\n\nAn open, collaborative dialogue is key.  A CRM can obtain advice, see SAOG17100, if they are unsure about aspects of a company?s tax accounting arrangements.\n\nHowever, there may be differences of opinion on what tax accounting arrangements are appropriate or what the reasonable steps are for the company?s situation.  Where these exist, the CRM must work through these in a reasonable and professional manner to understand the difference in opinion and why it has arisen.\n\nWhere, after taking any necessary advice, there are still differences and the CRM believes that the SAO or company may not have met the requirements, the CRM must escalate the issue, see SAOG19200, to\n\n\tthe Deputy Director in LBS or\n\tthe Business Unit Head in Local Compliance.\n\n\nIf it appears that a penalty may be due it is important that the CRM follows the penalty procedure as soon as the failure has come to their attention.  This is because there is a restrictive time limit, see SAOG21200, for taking penalty action.  Following the ordered steps set out at SAOG19000 the CRM must discuss the potential penalty situation with their Deputy Director or Business Unit Head and the Penalties Consistency Panel, before then explaining to the SAO (separately from other risks being addressed to the company/group) that \n\n\tthere has been a failure and\n\tthey intend to charge a penalty.\n\n\nA failure ?comes to the attention? of a HMRC officer when that officer knows that there has been a failure.  So if a CRM finds during a discussion that the SAO has not taken reasonable steps to ensure the tax accounting arrangements are appropriate, the date of the discussion is the date when the failure comes to their attention.      \n\n\nHome | Main Contents | Manual Contents\n\nPrevious Page | Next Page | Top | Menu\n\n\n\n\n?\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n        \t\t?

That was nearly 50 years ago, and he was drawing attention to the appeal by UNICEF, the United Nations Childrenâ€™s Fund, and the championing of the rights of children.\n\n\n\nMonday 14 November 2011\n\n\n\nWestern Mail\n\n \n\n \n\nSince that time, the rights of children have been growing steadily stronger and I am proud to note that when we mark Universal Childrenâ€™s Day this Sunday (20th November) we do so knowing Wales is the first country in the UK to pass legislation that enshrines the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) into domestic law.\n\nUniversal Childrenâ€™s Day is proclaimed by the United Nations and it is a day governments across the world use to promote, celebrate and highlight the importance of the Convention.\n\nThe UNCRC is an international legally binding convention developed and agreed by the UN to recognise the full range of human rights for children. In 1989, most governments across the world decided that children required an additional set of rights because young people under 18 years old are more vulnerable, have different needs, and require added protection.\nÂ \nHuman rights are guarantees that protect individuals and groups from actions that affect their freedom and human dignity. Human rights are things that you are entitled to by simply being a person and the Convention echoes this.Â  They are universal, which means they are the same for everyone. They are indivisible, which means they are equally important and interdependent.Â  Finally, they are inalienable, which means all humans have them and they cannot be taken away.\n\nThe Convention sets out these rights in 54 articles and two Optional Protocols. It spells out the basic human rights that children everywhere have: the right to survival; to develop to the fullest; to protection from harmful influences, abuse and exploitation; and to participate fully in family, cultural and social life.\n\nEvery right spelled out in the Convention is inherent to the human dignity and harmonious development of all children. The Convention protects children's rights by setting standards in health care, education and legal, civil and social services.\n\nThe UNCRC was ratified by the UN General Assembly in 1989 and on the 16th December 1991, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland formally agreed to make sure every child in the UK has access to the rights listed in the Convention.\nThe Welsh Government showed our commitment to the Convention by adopting it as the basis for policy making for children and young people in Wales in 2004.\n\nOn 16th March 2011, The Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure received royal assent, and became a part of Welsh law in May. The Measure places Wales ahead of the UK in making the UNCRC part of its domestic law. The Measure contains a number of provisions that will help to strengthen the rights-based approach taken by the Welsh Government's work with children and young people from birth.\n\nIt is a cross-cutting Measure, which means that it applies to all areas of work that are devolved to the Welsh Government.\n\nFrom May 2012, Welsh Ministers will have to pay due regard to the UNCRC as part of any new policy being developed or reviewed, and from 2014 when carrying out any of their powers or duties.Â \n\nIn Wales, weâ€™re leading the way in so many areas with regard to children and families. We were the first country in the UK to set up the post of Childrenâ€™s Commissioner. We have rolled out our innovative Integrated Family Support Services teams, a programme that is unique to Wales. Our Flying Start programme supports the youngest children in our most disadvantaged areas. The Measure and our commitment to the UNCRC is part of the progressive approach to supporting children and families that we are taking as a Government.\n\nWe have so much to be proud of in Wales, but as Minister for Children and Social Services, I have a real sense of achievement in knowing we as a Government are putting policies into action that will empower our children now and far into the future.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nDelicious\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreddit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAbout social bookmarking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n\nGwenda Thomas AM\n\nDeputy Minister for Children and Social Services\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews by search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nNews by topic\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAll topics \n\n\tBusiness and economy \n\n\tChildren and young people \n\n\tCulture and sport \n\n\tEducation and skills \n\n\tEnvironment and countryside \n\n\tEquality and diversity \n\n\tFirst Minister \n\n\tHealth and social care \n\n\tHousing and community \n\n\tImproving public services \n\n\tInternational \n\n\tLocal government \n\n\tOlder people \n\n\tPlanning \n\n\tSocial justice \n\n\tSustainable development \n\n\tTourism \n\n\tTransport \n\n\tWelsh language \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews by region \n\n\n\n\n\n\tNorth Wales\n\tMid Wales\n\tSouth West Wales\n\tSouth East Wales\n\tAll Wales\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews by date \n\n\n\n\n \n\nJanuary 2012\n\tM\tT\tW\tT\tF\tS\tS\n\t<< Dec\t \tFeb >>\n\t \t \t \t \t \t \t1\n\t2\t3\t4\t5\t6\t7\t8\n\t9\t10\t11\t12\t13\t14\t15\n\t16\t17\t18\t19\t20\t21\t22\n\t23\t24\t25\t26\t27\t28\t29\n\t30\t31\t \t \t \t \t \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAbout\n\tFirst Minister of Wales\n\tOrganisation explained\n\tCabinet and Ministers\n\tWelsh Government Civil Service\n\tProgramme for Government\n\tHistory and factfile\n\tRecruitment\n\tResearch\n\n \n\tNews\n\tLatest news\n\tArticles\n\tStatements\n\tLobby briefings\n\n \n\n \n\n\tTopics\n\tBusiness and economy\n\tChildren and young people\n\tCulture and sport\n\tEducation and skills\n\tEnvironment and countryside\n\tEquality and diversity\n\tHealth and social care\n\tHousing and community\n\tImproving public services\n\tInternational\n\tLocal government\n\tOlder people\n\tPlanning\n\tSocial justice\n\tStatistics\n\tSustainable development\n\tTourism\n\tTransport\n\tWelsh language\n\n \n\n \n\n\tPublications\n\tAccess to information\n\tHow to obtain a publication\n\tPublications Centre\n\tThe Publication Scheme\n\tInformation link\n\tCirculars\n\n \n\tConsultation\n\tOpen consultations\n\tClosed consultations\n\tAbout consultations\n\tConsultation newsletter\n\n \n\n \n\n\tLegislation\n\tLegislative programme 2011 - 2012\n\tSubordinate legislation\n\tTransfer of Functions Orders\n\tUK Parliamentary Bills\n\tGuidance\n\tWelsh referendum 2011\n\tNational Archives\n\tProgress of UK Parliamentary Bills\n\n \n\tFunding\n\tBudgets\n\tFinancial Reform\n\tGrants\n\n \n\tCampaigns\n\tMore campaigns\n\tWinter weather advice\n\n \n\n \n\n\nFollow us online\n\n\t\n\nRSS\n\n\t\n\nTwitter\n\n\t\n\nFacebook\n\n\t\n\nFlickr\n\n\t\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\nGet extra features\n\nRegister\n\tnewsletters\n\tforums\n\tcommenting\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\nCopyright Statement\n\n\t\nTerms and Conditions\n\n\t\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\t\nNational Assembly for Wales\n\n\t\nScottish Government\n\n\t\nNorthern Ireland Executive\n\n\t\nDirectGov\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\n",

          "Insted Consultancy\n\nHas Multiculturalism Failed? ? \n\nlinks to the current debate, February/March 2011\n\nInsted Consultancy, London (www.insted.co.uk)\n_________________________________________________\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis paper was compiled following David Cameron?s speech at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday 5 February 2011. \n\nThe speech and media discussions of it dealt with three principal themes:\n\n\nThe concept of multiculturalism, and whether multiculturalism in Britain, and in Europe more generally, has failed.\n\n\nThe nature and causes of violent extremism, and approaches to preventing it.\n\n\n?The Muslim question? ? the place of Islam and of Muslim communities in modern Europe, and the nature and causes of Islamophobia and anti-Muslim racism.\n\nIn addition there was consideration in the media of:\n\n\ndisagreement and controversy within the UK government relating to the three themes mentioned above, for example differences of opinion within the Cabinet, between the Home Office and the Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG),and between Conservatives and Liberal Democrats \n\nthe response of the Labour Party leadership to the prime minister?s speech\n\nthe actions and policies of the English Defence League (EDL), which happened to organise a large demonstration on the same day as the speech.\n\n\nThe concept of multiculturalism\n\n\nCriticisms of the prime minister?s remarks about multiculturalism were made by, amongst others, Rob Berkeley, Ruth Grove-White, Meral Hussein-Ece, Sunder Katwala, Cecile Laborde, Tariq Modood, Varun Oberoi, Kanishk Tharoor, Paul Vallely and Humza Yousaf\n\nSupport for the speech was expressed by, amongst others, Martin Bright, the English Defence League, Frank Furedi, Nick Griffin, Charles Moore, Melanie Phillips and \n\nNorman Tebbit.\n\n\nIncidentally, the prime minister?s views on state multiculturalism had previously been outlined in a speech he gave some three years earlier, when he was still leader of the opposition.\n\nThe BBC Wales Politics Show canvassed opinion about the prime minister?s speech amongst young people in Butetown, Cardiff. A range of views was expressed.\nA report from the Searchlight Educational Trust referred to the speech and proposed an interesting typology for considering multiculturalism and related issues. The report was summarised in relation to Mr Cameron?s speech by David Miliband.\n\nOn 7 March there was a lively exchange of views between Mehdi Hasan and Douglas Murray about multiculturalism and related issues on the BBC Politics Show.\n\nIt was preceded by a short film featuring Douglas Murray?s views.\n\n\nProfessor Bob Jackson discussed the prime minister?s speech in connection with the positive role that can be played in schools by religious education (RE).\n\n\nPreventing violent extremism\n\nCriticisms of the prime minister?s approach to preventing violent extremism were made by, amongst others, Madeleine Bunting, Liz Fekete, Jonathan Githens-Mazer, The Guardian, Mehdi Hasan, Robert Lambert and Andy Mycock. There were implied criticisms in a speech by Nick Clegg.\n\nSupport for the prime minister?s views on preventing violent extremism were expressed by, amongst others, Douglas Murray, Maajid Nawaz and the Quilliam Foundation, and by Charles Moore and Melanie Phillips.\n\nMuslims and Islam in modern Britain\n\n\nCriticisms of the prime minister?s views of Muslims and Islam in modern Britain were made by, amongst others, Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, Chris Allen, Madeleine Bunting, Engage, Karima Hamdan and Salma Yaqoob.\n\nThose who supported the prime minister on this subject included Charles Moore and Melanie Phillips, and also James Delingpole, Niles Gardiner and Haras Rafiq \n\nDebate and controversy within the government\n\nShortly before the prime minister?s speech, Peter Oborne described major disagreements within the Cabinet about preventing violent extremism, and amongst senior civil servants. His perceptions were cited and reinforced by, amongst others, Mehdi Hasan, Jonathan Githens-Mazer, and Seumas Milne. \n\n\nDifferences of opinion within the Conservative Party were alluded to by, amongst others, Norman Tebbit.\n\n\nThe English Defence League \n\n\nOn BBC Newsnight, a few days before the prime minister?s speech on 5 February, there was a short documentary film about the English Defence League (EDL) and there was an interview with the EDL?s leader. \n\n\nComments on the interview were published by the Muslim Council of Britain and by Suzanne Moore.\n\n\nDan Hodges published an account of how the prime minister?s speech was perceived by the EDL, and also an account of the EDL demonstration in Luton on 5 February.  \n\nFor background information and analysis, it is relevant to recall that Faith Matters published a substantial report on the English Defence League in November 2010.\n\n\n\n\nThe Labour Party\n\nShortly before the prime minister?s speech on 5 February Bob Pitt published a critical review of the Labour Party?s record over the last decade in relation to British Muslims.\n\n\nMehdi Hasan noted that the Labour Party leadership failed to make a high-profile response to the speech. There was, however, a response in due course from David Miliband.\n\nDan Hodges, who in common with David Miliband referred to the Searchlight Educational Trust report, wrote an extremely critical review of Labour?s record in relation to immigration and multiculturalism.\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n PAGE   \n\n PAGE   1 \n\n\n\n",

We do this by producing a set of ?risk estimates? of non-compliance, one for each of the 16 essential standards.\n\nWe have produced guidance, which explains the analytic methods we use in our statistical model. This is a technical guide and so assumes those people reading it have some statistical knowledge.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      \n  \n  \n  \n    \n    \n            \n                    Statistical guidance for the QRP\n\n                317.99 KB\n  \t\t\t\n        \n\n        \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nWe can then respond with front-line regulatory action such as scheduling inspections or making targeted enquiries.\n\nIt is important to recognise that QRPs do not produce judgements about the extent of a provider?s compliance. Inspectors make these judgements, and they use the QRPs as a starting point for their enquiries.\n\nWhat kind of information is included in the profiles?\n\nThe information presented in the profiles is organised using the 16 essential outcomes of quality and safety. We have sourced and analysed a range of data sources, both qualitative and quantitative, to build each QRP.\n\nThese include:\n\n\tother regulatory bodies ? for example the National Patient Safety Agency.\n\tthe NHS Litigation Authority.\n\troutine data collections ? for example Hospital Episode Statistics and estates return information collection.\n\tother CQC regulatory activity ? for example monitoring of compliance with the regulation on cleanliness and infection control.\n\tnational clinical audit datasets.\n\tinformation from people using services ? for example NHS Choices and feedback from Local Involvement Networks (LINks).\n\n\n\n\nFeedback from workshops and engagement events\n\nIn 2010 we carried out a series of workshops and engagement events around the country with clinicians and professionals, to consult on the quantitative indicators in the QRPs for NHS trusts.\n\nOur report on QRP engagement events presents the background for the engagement project and a detailed analysis of the feedback gathered at the events.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      \n  \n  \n  \n    \n    \n            \n                    Report on the QRP engagement events\n\n                789.69 KB\n  \t\t\t\n        \n\n        \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho will get to see these profiles?\n\nNHS trusts, lead commissioners, SHAs and Monitor can view updated QRPs for their relevant trusts via the password protected ?log-in? area:\n\nLog in to the Quality and Risk Profile (QRP) area.\n\nCurrently we update QRPs nine times a year for NHS providers. There are no scheduled updates in May, September and January, which is when we develop and evaluate the information provided by QRPs.\n\nMembers of the public do not have access to the QRPs, but instead they can use our website to access information on inspections at each provider.\n\nYou can find ?this information using the search box at the top-left of all pages in the 'For the public' section of the site.\n\nFind out more about the information available to the public\n\nAre there QRPs for adult social care and independent health care providers?\n\nWe are working to further develop QRPs for adult social care and independent health care providers. Our aim is to share QRPs with these providers in the same way as the NHS once this development work is complete.\n\nHow should providers and commissioners use the information in the QRP?\n\nProviders should find the QRP useful to support their internal monitoring of quality by identifying areas of lower-than-average performance and, where necessary, taking action to address these.\n\nNHS trusts\n\nWe recommend that NHS trusts use the data in their profile to guide their own internal monitoring of standards. As the profile will be updated continuously and a new version will be issued each month, it will enable NHS trusts to keep track of changes in the estimates for each of the essential standards.\n\nCommissioners\n\nWe also believe that commissioners including, in time, the GP commissioning consortia, will find the QRP invaluable for holding to account those that they commission services from, and for improving their commissioning for quality.\n\n\n\nHow will we use Strategic Executive Information System (STEIS) information?\n\nWe will be accessing the STEIS to use as another source of information for Quality Risk Profiles (QRPs) and our monitoring of compliance with the essential standards.\n\nThe STEIS information will be particularly helpful in monitoring ?never events?. These events can be difficult to identify in the statutory notifications received from the National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS).\n\nProviders should however be aware that only reporting to the STEIS does not fulfil the statutory obligation to notify us of certain events.\n\nUnder the Health and Social Care Act, NHS trusts must report notifiable patient safety incidents without delay to the NRLS. This will often mean serious patient safety incidents must be reported to both the STEIS and NRLS to satisfy contractual and legal obligations.\n\nIndependent health and adult social care providers must continue to notify us directly.\n\n      \n\n\n  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  \t\t\t\t\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n            \n                    Downloads\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      \n  \n  \n  \n    \n    \n            \n                    Guidance on using your QRP\n\n                650.83 KB\n  \t\t\t\n        \n\n        \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      \n  \n  \n  \n    \n    \n            \n                    Statistical guidance for the QRP\n\n                317.99 KB\n  \t\t\t\n        \n\n        \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      \n  \n  \n  \n    \n    \n            \n                    Report on the QRP engagement events\n\n                789.69 KB\n  \t\t\t\n        \n\n        \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrder print publications online\nor call 0870 240 7535\n\n\n\n\n\nData source documents\n\nThese documents, for each of the five types of NHS provider, specify the sources of data we use to feed into the profiles for each essential standard.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      \n  \n  \n  \n    \n    \n            \n                    Data sources: Acute and specialist NHS trusts\n\n                2.22 MB\n  \t\t\t\n        \n\n        \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      \n  \n  \n  \n    \n    \n            \n                    Data sources: Ambulance NHS trusts\n\n                606.6 KB\n  \t\t\t\n        \n\n        \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      \n  \n  \n  \n    \n    \n            \n                    Data sources: Learning disability NHS trusts\n\n                957.49 KB\n  \t\t\t\n        \n\n        \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      \n  \n  \n  \n    \n    \n            \n                    Data sources: Mental health NHS trusts\n\n                1.35 MB\n  \t\t\t\n        \n\n        \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      \n  \n  \n  \n    \n    \n            \n                    Data sources: Care NHS trusts\n\n                1.16 MB\n  \t\t\t\n        \n\n        \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      \n  \n  \n  \n    \n    \n            \n                    Data sources: Community NHS trusts\n\n                2.67 MB\n  \t\t\t\n        \n\n        \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n    \n  \n  \n    \nNew and featured\n\nJust launched ?

Written by Gaynor Evelyn Sweeney. Photographs Tony Knox\n\nSweeney:\n\nDescribe briefly what is your art form and your interests as an artist?\n\nSollars:\n\nMy practice lies mainly around painting, photorealist painting.  Although I have combined this in installations.  Other examples are soft sculptures, art based around text and letters and indeed Dollman.  Everything I do has a quirky cheeky take on life.\n\nSweeney:\n\nHow did Dollman come about?\n\nSollars:\n\nDollman was first derived from my observations when I first moved to Liverpool. I would see younger tracksuit generations on the back of the bus, wide eyed, obviously looking for their mates. It is a homage to the tracksuit generation of Liverpool.\n\nSweeney:\n\nHow did this evolve into Dollman Disco?\n\nSollars:\n\nThe seed for Dollman Disco was at the Transvoyeur Exhibition in the Liverpool Biennial 2004.  From the character embodied in the paintings set on younger generations, I transformed it from the two dimensional surface of the canvas and brought it alive.  A latex head was made of Dollman and with a tracksuit I became this persona from the paintings.  This took a performance element and at the opening in 2004 dressed as Dollman I had some portable music with me I had previously mixed.  I noticed the members of audience at the opening loved the music and were inquisitive by this character of Dollman.   People were dancing, singing and then the concept was born of Dollman Disco.  It has now become established from this as an events evening on a far corner of the planet called Liverpool and each individually themed and unique.  It makes people smile and have fun, which makes it all worthwhile.\n\nSweeney:\n\nWhat makes Dollman and Dollman Disco different and unique to anything else?\n\nSollars:\n\nDollman Disco is unique because it is something born from myself, Gary.  It is everything I like and it has my stamp all over it.  From the ideas conceived to the orchestration, everything is choreographed by me and I select those who participate, so it is one of like minded people.  Dollman Disco is something where there is good music, funny singers who can not sing, but exceptional entertainer, pork scratchings and single cigarettes for sale, games, shared fun and people smile throughout the night.  This is the most important thing that everyone has fun.  Dollman gets lots of help from friends, such as Sean Kenny, who one of the mad singers and has helped with the decorations, etc., for the events.\n\nSweeney:\n\nYour most recent event of Dollman Disco was Dollman Carnivalesque Discotheque.  Can you please describe the theme behind this and what happened on the night?\n\nSollars:\n\nDollman Carnivalesque Discotheque was set on clown motifs and psychedelic flowers.  Clowns are odd and psychedelic flowers are happy.  The core element of Dollman are a combination of these, ?oddity? and ?happiness?.  So, if ?you? are both ?odd? and ?happy? then get down to the next Dollman Disco!\n\nSweeney:\n\nWhat are your future objectives for Dollman and his disco mania?  Do you have any proposed events coming up?\n\nSollars:\n\nAfter all the functions of Dollman and his discos, ?he? has finally secured his first private event in the coming few months.  The public events of Dollman Disco are currently being planned too.  These include not only the core event of Dollman Disco as a social, arts and cultural event, but two further creative events which will links into this, but will be set around music and performance.  More information will be available on this in the coming months.\n\nSweeney:\n\nIn terms of your art work as a painter what is your next significant project for that?\n\nSollars:\n\nI have been short listed for the John Moores Prize at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool,  Hooray!\n\nHooray!  Also, I have planned an installation for the Biennial, which I am currently developing in my studio at the Bridewell.   There are currently four projects under research and development and will be present over the coming twelve months at different events and exhibitions.\n\nSweeney:\n\nAnything else in the pipeline from Gary Sollar?s, whether artist or Dollman?\n\nSollars:\n\nI have been invited to Salford in March 2007 for an upcoming exhibition.  The details on this are yet to be confirmed, but keep an eye out for updates.  Also, I want to take my mum and dad on holiday, so any donations welcome!!\n\nDollman Carnivalesque Discotheque Review on Saturday 6 May 2006 at Vines, Liverpool?\n\nThe recent Dollman Carnivalesque Discotheque was a fusion of wonderful mayhem, fun and frolics.  Bizarre characters, singers, entertainers and events to amuse the audience.  The visitors could participate in an array of games of ?Steeple chase? where the participants wore unlaundered underpants and horses heads, while on all fours another rode on their backs against another two contestants.  There was pass the parcel of several games at once.  The audience adorned moustaches and became a throng of Freddie Mercurys in a cacophony to Queen Anthems.  ?Match Dog Men and Match Dog Cats and Dogs? echoed through the air as the audience joined in with Dollman and Kenny and participants at the back with cardboard cut out brass band instruments.  The manifestations of Dollman Disco are each unique with different themes, not making it the same as the one before.\n\nFor more information on Gary Sollars and associated art and events, please check his website at www.garysollars.co.uk or email him at itsgarys@hotmail.com.\n\n            \n\n                \t\tSECTION: Interview ?

For personal, Scriptural, and historical reasons, I stopped believing in the authority of the priesthood and started thinking according to my own conscience. \n\n\n\n\n\nIt is hard for me to accept that an entire congregation is dependent upon one man for their salvation other than Christ himself. There are abuses and excesses of the priesthood that can be very damaging to a Christian's spiritual life. I know this from personal experience, and it took time for those wounds to heal. \n\n\n\n\n\nPlease keep in mind, I do not intend to defame the Eastern or Roman churches in telling you this. There are many good priests out there, and many members of these faiths with fulfilling spiritual lives. I, however, was not one of them. Where does that leave me? Am I automatically or have I been a Protestant? \n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the common understanding of the term: \n\n\n\n\n\nany Western Christian who is not an adherent of a Catholic, Anglican, or Eastern Church.\n\n\nhttp://dictionary.reference.com/browse/protestant\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you base it only on a technicality, I am a Protestant. I may not identify with any Protestant denomination or non-denominational church, and yet I am a Protestant. \n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the original meaning of the term:\n\n\n\n\n\nany of the German princes who protested against the decision of the Diet of Speyer in 1529, which had denounced the Reformation.\n\n\nhttp://dictionary.reference.com/browse/protestant\n\n\n\n\n\nThe original meaning is one in protest against the Roman Church. I, however, feel no need to protest the Roman Church. Unlike in Luther's time, we have the religious freedom to choose whether to follow the Vatican. No one is trying to burn me at the stake. \n\n\n\n\n\nI am free to appreciate the faith in Christ I share in common with Catholics, without wanting to be one of them. I therefore have nothing to protest. I'd prefer not to use the original meaning of the term in reference to myself, because that might have the connotation of being anti-Catholic. \n\n\n\n\n\nIf a Protestant is someone who agrees with the Five Solas of the Reformation, regardless of their denominational affiliation, I might be a Protestant. My agreement with the Solas is not without some qualifications and reservations, so I might be a \"liberal Protestant\". Ultimately, I wonder why I can't just follow Jesus and leave the divisions of the past behind.\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tDan\n\n\n\nJoined: 03 Dec 2003\nPosts: 273\nLocation: midwest\n\t\tPosted:  Wed Nov 11, 2009 7:45 pm?? ?Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tFriend,\n\n\n\n\n\nMany of us see ourselves as neither Catholic nor are we Protestant.    I believe true Christianity if you want to call it that, is neither.   Our salvation is not in a church nor a set of rules.   It is in Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat may I ask thee was Christ?   Was he a Christian?\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is much like the debate between Calvinism and Armenianism.   The one says if thee doesn't adhere to my belief, then thee must automatically be part of the other.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same could be said of the catholic and protestant debate, but is that necessarily so?    Must I be one or the other?    May I not be but a follower of Christ, which I see as far better than the follower of men.\n\n\n\n\n\nMay the Lord guide thee in all truth.   That is what I seek after.\n\n\nThy Friend,\n\n\nDan\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tSpyridon\n\n\n\nJoined: 07 Oct 2009\nPosts: 203\n\n\t\tPosted:  Wed Dec 2, 2009 9:51 pm?? ?Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tThe common definition of Protestant is any Western Christian who is not Roman Catholic.

It is in Jesus Christ. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI very much agree with Dan here. This is after all the original reason why Friends have historically resisted creeds. It is not our assent to a set of propositions that heals and affirms us, but rather our inward acceptance of the Spirit. This leads to a generous faith. If Creeds cannot heal us, only the Spirit, then we must judge a given community by 'the Fruits of the Spirit', not simply what is said in 'official dogma'. Instead of asking whether one is Protestant or Catholic, High/Low, Reformed, Conservative or Liberal, one should ask whether one is living in openness to God and our fellow human beings?\n_________________\nI saw the infinite love of God.

More than 500 jobs were lost. Many more jobs that depend on Vestas will follow. This makes no sense from a green or a labour perspective!\n\n\n\tAt the same time, the government announced a major expansion of renewable energy including wind power. We are calling on the government to intervene to save jobs at companies like Vestas - through nationalisation if that is what it takes - to show that it is serious about saving the planet.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWhat you can do\n\n\n\tHardship fund for sacked and redundant Vestas workers\nSend a donation from your trade union or other organisation, or make a personal donation. Cheques payable to RMT IOW 2 Vestas hardship & defence fund, and send to Keith Murphy, 57 Well Street, Ryde, IOW PO33 2RY.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n Actions & meetings\n \n\t\t\t\tWednesday 17 February\n\tNEWPORT, ISLE OF WIGHT 7pm, Save Our Services public meeting, called by Unison, but open to all who want to campaign against the proposed cuts to council and all jobs and services.

The 45-year-old counsellor is on a four-month attachment with the Commonwealth Secretariat in London, UK, to gain a better understanding of how an international organisation works. \nIn today's interconnected world, it is important to strengthen co-operation between countries, and for Mozambique, we need to develop new relationships and deepen ties with the rest of the world, said Mr Munateia, who is currently attached to the Secretariat's Governance and Institutional Development Division (GIDD).\n\nThe Commonwealth is an avenue for us to reach out to member countries in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, Europe and the Pacific. So it is good for Mozambique, which is the newest member of the Commonwealth, to learn about partnerships and collaboration, he added.\nMozambique joined the Commonwealth in 1995 and its government is keen on enhancing multilateral ties and co-operation for development.\nMozambique is a new democracy and so, we wish to learn how to further develop this process, and being recently attached to the Political Affairs Division at the Commonwealth Secretariat has exposed me to various activities like organisational affairs, electoral processes, observer missions and conflict prevention, Mr Munateia explained.\nIn GIDD, I learn about good governance and the formulation of development projects and the eligibility criteria for countries requiring financial or technical assistance.\nMr Munateia, who is part of a four-person team on attachment at the Secretariat until June 2004 said he has gained a broader perspective of events that has helped him in his understanding of politics, society, culture and development.\nAnother fellow attachment officer, Inacio Bernardo, an assistant economist in the Office of the Mozambican President, said the Project Management and Referrals Unit he is with, has exposed him to project viability assessment and implementation that will be useful in his drafting of reports and economic briefing notes.\nIn my work in the Office of the President, I deal a lot with the Southern African Development Community, the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States, and the Commonwealth, said Mr Bernardo, 36. So, my stint here at the Economic Affairs Division allows me to improve my skills in economics where I get to work with experts on trade issues.\nManuel Sithole, a legal assistant in the Mozambican Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy, is eager to hone his skills in international negotiations and legal affairs.\nAt the Special Advisory Services Division at the Secretariat, I'm learning how I can provide legal advice to my government or a corporation in legal issues especially in commercial and trade matters, said Mr Sithole, 29.\nI can offer advice to Mozambican companies in bidding for international projects or when they develop joint ventures or partnerships in businesses.\nMr Sithole expressed hope of increasing his knowledge of international business law and practices to complement the different legal system he is familiar with in Mozambique which is based on Portuguese law.\nArsenio Sarmento, an officer in Mozambique's Department of International Co-operation at the Ministry of Youth and Sports, believes he benefits from his exposure to the Commonwealth Youth Programme.\nI learn about how things are run in programmes like the Youth Ambassadors for Positive Living, the Diploma in Youth Development and the Commonwealth Youth Credit Initiative so that I can help my country play a meaningful role, said Mr Sarmento, 32.\nWe are also ready to share our experience with other members of the Commonwealth in order to learn from each other about youth development, for they hold promise for the future of our nations.\n\nCNIS - the Commonwealth News and Information Service Issue 178 7 April 2004\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you find this useful?\n\n\t0%\n\t0%\n\t0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd your comment\n*��Name\n*��Email (not displayed on screen)\n\n*��Message\n\n\tCAPTCHA (required)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this page\n\nAbout Bookmarks\n\n\tdelicious\n\tdigg\n\treddit\n\tfacebook\n\tstumbleupon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t                \n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t    \nLatest news\n\tCommonwealth Expert Team issues Final Report on November 2011 Presidential Election in The Gambia\n\tCommonwealth to convene judicial seminar in Papua New Guinea\n\tDeparture Statement - Commonwealth ministerial mission to Maldives\n\n\n\n\nVisit the Commonwealth Secretariat online image library\n\tCommonwealth Images\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\tE-mail News alert\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\tTop of this page\n\tDisclaimer\n\tRSS\n\tContact Us\n\tEmail this page\n\tComsec Web Access\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Holdings include some early Croatian and Montenegrin printed material in the 15th and 16th centuries, in Latin, Glagolitic and Old Church Slavonic script.\nThe Yugoslav collections contain unique research material, which traces the evolution of South Slav culture and history from the late 16th century to the 1990s. The collections include general histories of the South Slavs, and material covering Bosnia and Hercegovina, Croatia and Slavonia, Dalmatia, Dubrovnik, Macedonia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia, Slovenia and Vojvodina. Material following the development of the Yugoslav State, from 'the Eastern Question', the Balkan Wars, World War I and Yugoslav unification through the interwar years to liberation and the establishment of the post-war Socialist Yugoslavia is well represented.\nThe Library holds good runs of post-war academic series, principal official publications, and holdings in the areas of literature, ethnography and the arts are good. Special attention has been paid to the acquisition of material reflecting the social and political changes in the region, the national movements and ethnic conflicts which characterised the transitional 1980s and 1990s. The collections now contain previously forbidden newspapers and journals, as well as party manifestos, drafts of laws and proposals for economic reform. Wherever possible, those items destroyed during World War II have been replaced.\nThe Library aims to collect all possible material from the newly independent states in the territories of the former Yugoslavia even under very difficult circumstances (war, sanctions, etc). At the moment, the British Library holds the best material in the United Kingdom on the Balkan Crisis and issues which have dominated the political agenda in the wake of the collapse of Yugoslavia, covering war, genocide, ethnic cleansing, human rights, refugees, territorial maps, peace conferences, war crimes; some newspaper cuttings are also held.\nAfter the collapse of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, several new independent countries were created: the Republic of Slovenia, the Republic of Croatia, the Republic of Bosnia and Hercegovina, the Republic of Macedonia and the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro.\nCatalogues, printed guides and other resources\nFormer Yugoslav material is listed in the printed volumes of the British Library General Catalogue of Printed Books to 1975 (for material acquired before 1975 only) and searchable online via Explore the British Library, which is accessible via the internet. Material acquired and catalogued prior to 1975 is in Cyrillic (with headings in transliteration); post-1975 material, however, is displayed in transliterated form, according to Library of Congress rules. For information on searching and transliteration please see Searching for Cyrillic items in the catalogues of the British Library: guidelines and transliteration tables.\nCatalogues and printed guides\n\tExplore the British Library\n\tThe Balkan crisis, 1990-: catalogue [Part 1], compiled by Sava Peic and Magda Szkuta [2719.k.2515]\n\tThe Balkan crisis, 1990-: catalogue [Part 2], compiled by Sadie Morgan-Cheshire and Magda Szkuta [2719.k.2515]\n\tCyrillic books printed before 1701 in British and Irish collections: a union catalogue, compiled by R.

The sea was extremely rough and at first the only birds moving were herring and common gulls flying north with the wind. After 20 minutes or so I picked out a largish skua slowly flying north and occasionally harrying and chasing both common and herring gulls. The size of the bird, along with a deep chest, broad arm and typically measured wing-beat at first suggested great skua when first seen further out in rather poor visibility but when it harried a common gull and followed it to just off the beach I could see that it was an adult dark morph pomarine skua. (Memories of a year spent at Dungeness came to mind when flocks of up to 80 poms beefed ther way up the channel on balmy May mornings.) All the gulls on the beach panicked and the skua slowly headed out to sea again. Buoyed by this excitement and dreaming of little gull, leach's petrel and more skuas I stayed for a further 80 minutes, getting colder by the second but the only other bird of note was a second winter Mediterranean gull heading north. In total some 420 herring gulls flew north with smaller numbers of common gulls before I gave in and headed for my warm living room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\n\n\nRussell Jones\n\n\n\n\nat\n09:48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n          \n\n          \n        \nFriday, 4 February 2011\n\n\n          \n        \n\n\n\n\nRSPB Volunteers....................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf anyone has a bit  of spare time the RSPB are urgently looking for volunteers to carry out farmland  bird surveys in the local area.

          "“Feedback is the breakfast of champions.” \nQuoted by Ken Blanchard  \nReality about the importance of feedback hit home whilst studying the Diploma in Teaching in \nthe Lifelong Learning Sector (DTLLS) course.  I was astounded to find out how much the feedback \nreceived affected my motivation and progression.  \nProfessor Paul Black and Professor Dylan Wiliam‟s initial research has proved that informal classroom \nassessment with constructive feedback will raise levels of attainment if carried out effectively \n(Assessment Reform Group [pamphlet] 1999).  Likewise poor feedback can result in losing learners as \ncited by the Guardian online, Major (2001).  \nLLUK (2007) Professional Standards state \nwithin Domain E that we as tutors should “use \nassessment information to promote learning \nAnother significant factor that has shaped my professional development through assessment \nthrough questioning and constructive feedback, \nand feedback was the ungraded observations.  I found that I was able to experiment with my \nand involve learners in feedback activities.” \ndelivery.  Surprisingly all my observations were done by different lectures/tutors so I was able to \nobtain a variety of knowledge from a vast pool of professionalisms.  I have learnt and imple-\nmented various proposals via the feedback received and discovered that the feedback ob-\ntained has helped improve my own personal development as a tutor.  From the feedback re-\nceived I have been able to influence the classroom dynamics to get the most from the learners.  \nFor me the most important assessment method that has \nhelped me has been the reflective journals.  I did not fully \nappreciate or understand the impact of reflection until I \nbegan to generate my own journals.  I found that I was I am so impressed by the way you approached and dealt with an unfamiliar teaching \nable to visualize solutions to some of the concerns I had situation which had been thrust upon you.   You showed great good humour, enthusiasm \nidentified in relation to my teaching practice.   and professionalism.  I‟m very interested in how you feel about this new teaching com-\nmitment now – could it be an exciting new chapter for you?  It‟s also great that you have \nhad some good support and advice along the way from experienced practitioners, which \nyou will remember and draw upon when needed in the future.  \nThe Dreyfus (1986) model of stages of skill acquisition (novice to expert) \nemphasized how expert learning is derived increasingly from reflective \nexperience rather than theoretical learning.  As experts no longer rely on \nrules or guidelines but have an intuitive grasp of situations based on \ndeep understanding and can visualize what is possible through reflection. \nI really enjoyed reading about your adventures, thank you.  Your „next steps‟ are \nvery sensible and demonstrate both your willingness to learn from more experienced \ncolleagues and your re-kindled motivation to take on this new challenge; you have \nVery good teachers are those whose practice is the result of careful reflection \nfaced what could have been a difficult situation and have come out triumphantly!  \nand self-critical evaluations to adjust what they do next time (Why Colleges \nIt‟s great that you are thinking and reflecting on how you could modify your practice \nSucceed, Ofsted 2004).  Even though most of us would prefer not to be criti-\nto enhance the learning of a group that is unfamiliar to you (and relatively short-\ncized Hainsworth (2005) in the Guardian online discovers that learning how to \nterm).

It has old toilet facilities, however there are plans to replace these in the near future. The hall is fairly large and can be split into two parts by way of a sliding shutter.

Unfortunately the building has been poorly designed and makes inefficient use of space - the whole upper floor is accessed by a single staircase, so is not DDA compliant and can only be used for storage. The sloping ceiling over the badminton court makes it impossible to use. The facility features office accommodation currently unused. Kitchen is disproportionately small. An unfortunate example of an overly ambitious project which is not functional and proving a burden to the Parish Council.\n\t\n\tFacilities\tMain hall\tx\n\t\tSmall hall\n\t\tMeeting room\tx\n\t\tPermanent stage\n\t\tBar\n\t\tOffice\tx\n\t\tKitchen\tx\n\t\tToilets\tx\n\t\tChanging facilities\tx\n\t\tLounge\n\t\tStorage space\tx\n\t\tOther\n\t\n\tAncillary facilities\tPlaying pitches\tx\n\t\tPlay area\tx\n\t\tMUGA\n\t\tOther\tMUGA planned, play area is dilapidated.\n\t\n\tSize of main space\tUp to 100m2\n\t\t101-150m2\t144\n\t\t151-200m2\n\t\t201-250m2\n\t\t251-300m2\n\t\t301-350m2\n\t\t351-400m2\n\t\t400m2 +\n\t\n\t\n\tSize of secondary space\t26\n\t\n\tEstimated seated capacity of main hall\tUp to 25\n\t\t26-50\n\t\t51-100\n\t\t100+\t100\n\t\n\t\n\tNumber of parking spaces\t30\n\t\n\tGeneral condition of facilities (internal)\tMain hall\tExcellent\n\t\tSmall hall\n\tExcellent\tMeeting room\tExcellent\n\tGood\tPermanent stage\n\tAverage\tBar\n\tPoor\tOffice\n\tVery Poor\tKitchen\tExcellent\n\t\tToilets\tExcellent\n\t\tChanging facilities\tGood\n\t\tFlooring\tExcellent\n\t\tLounge\n\t\tHeating\tExcellent\n\t\tElectrical\tExcellent\n\t\tStorage space\tGood\n\t\tOther\n\t\n\t\n\tCondition comments and investment needs\tAs noted above - while condition is good (as would be expected with one year old facility) quality of facilities and suitability is lacking\n\t\n\tOutline investment costs\t\tPotentially substantial\n\t\n\tGeneral condition of facilities (external)\tRoof/gutters\tExcellent\n\t\tCar park\tExcellent\n\t\tBuilding structure\tExcellent\n\t\tGeneral landscaping\tGood\n\t\n\t\n\tCondition comments and investment needs\tExterior in good condition\n\t\n\tOutline investment costs\n\t\n\tFacility accessibility\tWheelchair access throughout\n\t\tSome wheelchair access\tx\n\t\tAccessible toilets\tx\n\t\tFacility to assist partially sighted\n\t\tDisabled parking\tx\n\t\n\t\n\tAccessibility comments and investment needs\tDownstairs appears generally compliant and accessible, but upstairs rooms not accessible.\n\t\n\tOutline investment costs\tAs above - could be substantial\n\t\n\tEnvironment and efficiency\tDraught proofing\tx\n\t\tDouble glazing\tx\n\t\tEnergy saving bulbs\tx\n\t\tLight sensors/timers\tx\n\t\tSelf closing doors\tx\n\t\tCisterniser\tx\n\t\tPush taps\n\t\n\t\n\tEnvironment comments and investment needs\tGenerally good\n\t\n\tOutline investment costs\n\t\n\tSuitability for sport/active recreation\tBadminton\n\t\tIndoor mat bowls\tx\n\t\tYoga\tx\n\t\tFitness classes - aerobics, keep fit, pilates\tx\n\t\tMartial arts\tx\n\t\n\t\n\tSport/ recreation comments and needs\tMain hall (ostensibly sports hall) not suitable for badminton/volleyball due to sloping ceiling.

Take a Kenyan farmer and a schoolgirl from New Zealand, for instance. At first, there seems to be no apparent connection between them. But in reality, the farmer knows a village chief who does business with a Nairobi merchant, whose brother is a civil servant, who happens to know a New Zealand NGO worker, whose sister is the schoolgirl's mother. \n\nStatistically, it seems there would never be more than 6 degrees of separation between any two living persons on earth. I'm not sure this is absolutely true, but this idea illustrates the very tight web of connections that binds us together as human beings. \n\n1. An interdependent world\n\nWe live in an interdependent world. Events taking place at the other end of the planet often have a direct impact on our lives. Consider, for example, the chain of events triggered by the fall of the Berlin Wall or Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.\n\nWe rely on an extended network of people across the world for the food we eat, the clothes we buy, the films we watch, the cars we drive. \n\nTake an action as simple as a phone call. The cellular phone I use has been designed in Finland, manufactured in China, and sold in Britain. It has been marketed by an American company and the network it is linked to is owned by a Japanese multinational. As for the account, who knows who it is paid to? In this simple operation, a global network of people and countries has been brought into play.\n\nInterdependence makes us more powerful. We have more power to buy the best goods more cheaply, more power to reach friends and family wherever they are, more power to increase our standard of living and the prospects of our children. We also enjoy more freedom. Freedom to travel; freedom to communicate; freedom to learn. But the forces of interdependence also make us more vulnerable.\n\nFinancial markets collapsing in one region of the world can trigger a recession on another continent. The decision to lower interest rates in one country could mean less buying power for pensioners in another. The pollution we produce can affect the living standards of people in faraway countries. The tremors of distant conflicts can shake the foundations of our own communities.\n\nAnd of course, the 11 September attack in the United States made it clear that terrorism is a threat for all of us. We are all vulnerable. This, unfortunately, is also what interdependence means.\n\n2. The Commonwealth in a changing world\n\nThe challenge for us today is to adapt to the rapid changes brought about by the forces of integration. We must ensure that we are able to adjust to the new political and economic landscape taking shape before us.\n\nThis challenge is particularly relevant to the Commonwealth. If we still want to be part of the game tomorrow, we must be ahead of the game today. \n\nWe need to grasp the new opportunities created by our connected world while at the same time holding on to the values that make up our common identity. We must act with vision and foresight while strengthening the close ties that unite our members together. We must embrace the forces of change and welcome the benefits of globalisation and ensure that our more vulnerable members are included in the process. \n\nAnd in everything we do, we must recognise that, with increased integration comes increased responsibility. In the face of the troubles and challenges confronting the world today, indifference is not an option. By remaining indifferent, we will not make the world safer for ourselves. We will make it more dangerous for everyone, including ourselves.\n\nWe cannot disentangle ourselves from the ties that hold us together as human beings. The words of the poet John Donne are as relevant today as they were 400 years ago: \n\n\"No man is an island entire of itself\", he wrote. \"every man is a piece of the Continent, a part of the main?\" \n\nWhen a child is dying of AIDS in Africa, we should see it as our business to help.\n\n\"?Any man's death diminishes me because I am involved in Mankind?\"\n\nWhen a flood leaves thousands of people homeless in Mozambique or Bangladesh, we should see it as our business to provide assistance.\n\nWhen a democratic government is overthrown, we should see it as our business to help restore democracy.\n\n\"?and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.\"\n\nWe must share this responsibility as communities, families and individuals.\n\nThis sense of responsibility is also at the heart of the Commonwealth project. It is what makes us relevant to the world today. It is what runs through all the work we do. Be it the fight against terrorism, the alleviation of poverty or the promotion of democracy.\n\n3. Terrorism\n\nThe threat of terrorism is not new for the Commonwealth. Indeed, many of our member states have been directly affected by acts of terrorism. And many Commonwealth leaders have been the victims of attacks by extremist groups.\n\nThe Commonwealth can use the power of diversity to help make a difference. The Commonwealth has no battalions. Its strength lies in the solidarity of its members, in their common commitment to democracy, the rule of law and pluralism.\nIn a world that is becoming increasingly polarised, this inclusiveness is of particular relevance. By bringing together people of different faiths and cultures from a diversity of countries, large and small, rich and poor, the Commonwealth can present a united front in the fight against terrorism.\n\nThat is just what happened a few weeks ago when Commonwealth leaders issued a statement calling for resolute action against terrorist activities. This statement goes very far. It does not merely condemn acts of terrorism. It establishes that any member country which supports terrorists is in violation of the fundamental values of the Commonwealth and has no place in our organisation.\n\nThe statement also calls for greater international co-operation to combat terrorism. On extradition and the exchange of information between member countries, the Commonwealth also has an important contribution to make. The Commonwealth can assist in the implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution 1373 calling for international action against terrorism.\n\nMoreover, we can take advantage of the common legal framework shared by many of our members to facilitate the adoption of laws in areas such as money laundering and extradition.\n\nWe will do all we can to cut the money supply of terrorists and those who support them. We are committed to co-operate with the international community to freeze and confiscate the assets of terrorists. Moreover, I constituted a Ministerial Committee to discuss ways in which the Commonwealth can move forward on some of these issues. \n\nOf course, we can ? and we must ? do more. We must combat indoctrination, fanaticism and extremist ideologies, whatever form they take. We cannot engage in a dialogue with the terrorists. But we can engage with those they seek to indoctrinate. We can prevent others joining their ranks. That is why education must also be part of our strategy.\n\nFollowing the 11 September, we have seen people united in their grief. In times of danger, we tend to huddle together. We re-order our priorities. We think less about ourselves and more about others. We worry less about our own needs and more about our friends, our family, our community. \n\nAre we witnessing the end of the \"me generation\"? It is probably too early to say. But one thing is certain: we cannot afford to turn our backs to the troubles our world is facing. We cannot afford to always put ourselves first. We must all recognise the need to shoulder responsibility. Indifference may sometimes seem a more attractive option, but the cost of silence is always high.\n\nAs Edmund Burke once said, \"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.\"\n\n4. Poverty alleviation\n\nIt will take a while before we are able to grasp the full implications of the 11 September terrorist attack in the United States. In the aftermath of the event, economic growth is expected to fall in most developed countries.\n\nBut according to the World Bank, developing countries will be the worst hit by the economic slowdown. Ten million more people will be thrown into poverty as a result of the attacks. Tens of thousands more children will die worldwide. Why ? simply because they are at the end of the line. And at the end of the line there is no food, no water, no shelter and no vaccines.\n\nThe economies of developing countries will suffer from reduced investment and falling commodity prices. According to the International Labour Organisation, job opportunities will be cut by at least 24 million. Tourism is being hit exceptionally hard. 65% of the holidays booked for the Caribbean have been cancelled. Yesterday's tragedy in Queens could hardly have helped.\n\nThese adverse consequences must strengthen our commitment to alleviate poverty. In these difficult times, more than ever, we must assume our responsibility toward the poor. 1.2 billion people live under 1$ a day. More than a third are Commonwealth citizens. The total annual wages of 1.2 million poor people in Africa amount to less than what Bernie Eccleston alone earned last year.\n\nThis is not only a moral issue. Poverty also represents a threat to civil order and world stability.\n\nGlobalisation has been blamed for increasing the gap between the rich and the poor. But globalisation, if well managed, can be ? and must be ? part of the solution to world poverty. Together, we must ensure that the fruits of globalisation are distributed more fairly. If globalisation is to fulfil its promise, we must make sure that it works for the benefit of the many, not the few.\n\nIt is crucial that no one is left by the wayside in the process of globalisation; that the gains from technological advances and from the opening of markets are more equitably distributed.\n\nAt the beginning of the World Trade Organisation meeting in Doha, I said that increased trade liberalisation will only work if it works for the benefit of all countries. A world of free trade where some countries have more freedom to trade than others is simply unacceptable. If we want trade negotiations to be successful, the concerns of developing countries must be taken seriously.\n\nInternational trade issues are notoriously complex. But some imbalances are obvious enough. Trade barriers on manufactured products have been repeatedly lowered, and now stand at an average of 4%, while barriers for agricultural exports ? a key to most developing nations' economies ? have remained very high: they average 40% worldwide.\n\nIn addition, industrialised countries continue to maintain high levels of export subsidies on agricultural products. In fact, the total amount of agricultural subsidies spent every year by OECD countries is equivalent to the entire gross domestic product of sub-Saharan Africa. How can that fact alone bring confidence to farmers in developing countries?\n\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic also demands appropriate responses. While patents of drug companies must clearly be protected to encourage investment in research, developing nations also need to have access to cheap generic drugs to treat public health disasters like AIDS. There are encouraging signs that negotiators in Doha may have finally arrived at an agreement on this issue.\n\nBuilding walls around your country is a waste of time when terrorists can climb over that wall and blow up your icons in front of your eyes. There must be a shift in the way trade negotiations are conducted. In an interconnected world economy, where we want the benefits to be widespread, the rule of the game is not: \"I win if you lose\"; but: \"I only win if we win together.\"\n\nIf developed countries accept to do their share today, they ? and all the other nations in the world ? will reap the benefits tomorrow. The truth is that we can all gain from the opening of markets provided that we all play by the same rules.\n\nBefore their meeting in Genoa a few months ago, I wrote to all G8 leaders to encourage them to embrace a vision of generous globalisation. I urged them:\n\nTo take a flexible approach to countries deep in debt\n\nTo reverse the decline in aid from the industrialised countries\n\nTo make the markets of the industrialised countries accessible to exports from developing countries.\n\nIn line with this approach, the Commonwealth has taken concrete steps to assist Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs). It was Commonwealth Finance Ministers who provided the leadership which eventually led to the initiative to reduce the debt of HIPCs. The Commonwealth continues to maintain pressure on the IMF and the World Bank to provide even greater debt reduction to these countries.\n\nThe Commonwealth has provided developing countries with a computer software that helps them to better analyse and manage their debt. An updated version of this software was launched a few weeks ago it is now being used by over 50 countries, both inside and outside the Commonwealth.\n\nWe can also use trade as a tool for reducing poverty. According to the World Bank, abolishing all trade barriers could boost global income and lift 320 million people out of poverty within the next 10 to 15 years. This is why we must urge developed countries to make a sustained effort to reduce their own trade barriers and give developing countries increased access to their markets.\n\nThe Commonwealth also recognises that small countries are particularly vulnerable to the rapid changes brought about by globalisation. This is why the Commonwealth was the first to address the special problems encountered by small states. It now runs a number of programmes aimed at reducing these states' vulnerability to external economic shocks and threats to their sovereignty and security. Again, we must act in a spirit of generous globalisation.\n\n5. Democracy\n\nAnother important tool in the fight against poverty is the promotion of democracy. Democracy does not only empower people or bring peace and social justice; it also creates the conditions for economic growth.\n\nDemocracy is good for growth and growth is good for democracy. The two go hand in hand.\n\nEconomic growth is more likely to be achieved in a stable political environment that recognises the value of the individual and empowers all citizens to achieve their full potential. Business people will only invest in countries where there is political stability, in other words, where government is open, honest and respectful of the rights of the citizen. Multi-party-systems, freedom of speech, civil rights are important tools of economic development. \n\nA very suggestive illustration of the link between democracy and development is the fact that, as Amartya Sen once famously remarked, \"No substantial famine has ever occurred in a democracy\".\n\nAnd conversely, democracy depends on economic well-being. You can't have a functioning democracy if you don't have adequate shelter, healthcare, education, easy access to clean drinking water. You can't eat democracy. You won't succeed in promoting democracy in a country where the conditions under which democracy can thrive are just not there.\n\nThe Commonwealth's commitment to democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights is embodied in the 1991 Harare Declaration. In 1995, Commonwealth Heads of Government set up a Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) to deal with serious or persistent violations of the Harare principles. We are still the only international organisation where such a group exists. We are still the only international organisation that can penalise those that fall foul of the rules.\n\nNigeria, Sierra Leone and The Gambia were all either suspended from the Commonwealth or from its councils for various periods. In each case a civilian and democratic government has now been restored. More recently, Pakistan and Fiji have been suspended from the councils of the Commonwealth following military coups.\n\nWe also work actively behind the scenes, using \"discreet diplomacy\" to resolve or to prevent internal political crises, providing Election Observers, promoting democracy workshops or strengthening electoral institutions in member countries. By its very nature, some of this valuable work takes place away from the glare of publicity ? and thus remains unsung. We don't win every time, but we win more often than we lose.\nConclusion\n\nThe Chinese have a proverb: \"May you live in interesting times\". This is meant, not as a blessing, but as a curse. Interesting times are times of conflict, violence and war. Well, no one would deny that we live in interesting times. \n\nPeople have never been watching the news more avidly. Ratings for documentaries and news programmes are up, newspapers sell more. We seem to have all but forgotten about Posh and Becks and Big Brother. Instead, we buy books about religious fundamentalism and we catch up on the \"war against terrorism\" at every opportunity.\n\nBut living in interesting times does not necessarily need to be a curse. Interesting times are also full of opportunities. Out of the danger comes the will to change things, to better the world, to create the promise of greater justice.\n\nOur times are also interesting because the world has become smaller, because walls are falling, because knowledge is expanding. There is hope in this. Hope that we can transform the curse into a blessing. Hope that we can make this era an era of responsibility. An era where people take more responsibility for themselves, their families, their communities and demand more international responsibility from their governments. \"No man is an island entire of itself.\"\n\n13 November 2001\n\n\n\n\nShare this page\n\nAbout Bookmarks\n\n\tdelicious\n\tdigg\n\treddit\n\tfacebook\n\tstumbleupon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t                \n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t    \nLatest documents\n\t2011 Guyana Elections Final Report\n\n\nDocuments...\n\n\n\nGet Acrobat\nTo view many of the documents in this section you will need Adobe Reader.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\tTop of this page\n\tDisclaimer\n\tRSS\n\tContact Us\n\tEmail this page\n\tComsec Web Access\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
